Hi Marty, 
The attached lawsuit was filed this week in federal court in California alleging that Jeffrey Epstein and another 
man, Donald Trump, raped her in 1994. We're planning to publish a story on the suit this afternoon, and we 
want to make sure it is fair. Is Mr. Epstein available to speak? Or do you want to offer a comment on this 
behalf? 
My number is 
Thank you in advance.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011725.txt,"because we were people with whom Rabin felt comfortable — a counterpoint, I
suspect, to the old Labor Party rival whom he had made Foreign Minister,
Shimon Peres. Though the two men had grown to respect each another over the
years, Rabin neither trusted, nor much liked, Shimon. In fact, though Peres’s
support inside Labor had secured him the foreign ministry, Rabin had stipulated
that all peace talks would remain under his control.

Yet as I'd discover nearly a decade later, when I was Prime Minister, even
the most carefully planned negotiating strategies were always subject to
setbacks, diversions, or simply what former British Prime Minister Harold
Macmillan once called “events, dear boy, events.” Rabin’s initial plan was not
to start with the Palestinians. He did feel it was essential to try to reach a
political settlement with them. In one respect, the prospects looked slightly
better than before. Arafat’s political position had been weakened: first by an
intifada driven as much by local insurgents as by the PLO in faraway Tunis, and
then by his decision to break with his longtime Gulf Arab financial supporters
and support Saddam Hussein the Gulf War. In 1988, as the entry price for a
formal dialogue with the Bush Administration, he had also agreed to a statement
in which he renounced terrorism and accepted the principle of a two-state peace
agreement with Israel. Still, there remained a yawning gap between the “self-
rule” envisaged in the Camp David accords of 1978 and the Madrid conference,
and the independent state the Palestinians wanted. Negotiations to bridge it were
likely to be fraught and long.

So he’d decided to begin with Syria. President Assad was obstinate, and
publicly opposed to the idea of making peace with Israel. But he’d been in
power for more than two decades and, crucially for Rabin, had lived up to the
few, indirect agreements Israel had made with him. The substance in any
agreement, though politically difficult, was also more straightforward. We knew
what Assad wanted: the recovery of the Golan Heights, in return for the
absolute minimum level of political normalization with Israel. We knew what
we wanted: security guarantees and assurances regarding water resources, and a
full and final peace treaty. For Rabin, there was an additional attraction in
beginning with Syria: if we did reach a deal with our main Arab enemy, the
pressure would intensify on the Palestinians to follow suit.

The dramatic turn of events that ultimately forced him to change tack began
in January 1993 in the sitting room of a villa outside Oslo, at an ostensible
“academic seminar” convened by the Norwegian diplomat Terje Larsen. It
included two Israeli academics with personal ties to prominent Palestinians:

interest margin.

Goldman Sachs (GS)

We value the brokers based on the relationship between ROE (return on equity} and PB
(price to book), which has a high historical correlation. Our $230 PO is based on a target
PB multiple of 1.2x our forward book value estimate, which is above our 2017E ROE of
roughly 10% as we add in higher interest rate expectations and loosening regulations
into our multiple.

Risks to the downside are a weaker economy/capital markets, increased macro issues,
tougher regulation, and litigation, while risks to the upside are a stronger economy,
moderating macro risks, market share gains, and less onerous regulatory and legal
issues.

Great Western Bancorp Inc (GWB)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $42 price
objective and assign a 2.0x multiple to our 2Q17E TBV given that we believe the market
would pay premium for GWB's 2016 estimated returns of 15%, in line with the median
premium of its peer group (High performing, Midwest peers, and SMIDs). We place a 16x
multiple on our 2017E EPS, a premium to its peer group given higher quality earnings.
Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 3%.

Downside risks to our price objective are a prolonged downturn in the farm sector and
lower for longer interest rate environment. Upside risks are a better than expected
improvement in the farming industry and a much stronger economic improvement in the
Midwest economy.

Hancock Holding (HBHC)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $41 price
objective. We assign a 1.5x multiple to our 2Q17E TBY, in line with SMID-cap peers
based on their in-line return profile, and this translates to $35.75. We place a 14.5x
multiple on our 2017E EPS, in line with other peers based on forecasted EPS growth, for
$33. Our DCF assumes a two-stage model with terminal growth rate of 3.5% and a cost
of capital of 8.5% to derive our $35 PO.

Downside risks to our price objective are regulatory issues, slowing growth and if M&A
synergies do not materialize. Upside risks are better than expected cost saves, stronger
loan growth that would lead to better than forecast spread revenue and lower credit
costs.

Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our PO of $13
and assign a 1.8x multiple to 2017E TBV and a 14x multiple on 2017E EPS, below
historical multiples. This is due to more stringent capital standards and the negative fee
income impact of pending regulatory reform. Our DCF analysis uses a cost of equity of
15.7% in the first stage and 11% in the second stage, and a terminal growth rate of 3%.

Risks to our price objective are an inability to offset regulatory fee income headwinds
and integration risk associated with FMER. Other risks are an inability to return capital
to shareholders in a timely fashion or overpaying for an acquisition target.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011043.txt,"My purpose in this analysis of the firm has been to derive equations valid for any
capital of either factor. The firm is a good model for several reasons. Its accounting
traditions are centuries old, and have been well thought through. It is rich in
possibilities because it has to be. It must describe firms of many kinds. It must allow
for contingencies whether or not they apply. For many simple assets, say the firm’s
shares as opposed to itself, revenue and positive cash flow can be the same. But the
complexity and versatility of the firm itself, and the person-likeness added by its

internal management, make it a useful model for any and all capital of either factor.
Not that I claim to follow accounting tradition closely, or even to understand it
closely. | am even less an accountant than an economist. My terms and concepts

tend to be idiosyncratic. The main thing is for the logic to hold together.

Human Capital by Analogy to the Firm

It is reasonable to define pay as the revenue of human capital. Earned revenue for
the firm is typically less than revenue. There are prior claims to offset contribution
by worker and suppliers. The counterpart in human capital, I said in Chapter 2, is
maintenance consumption. | believed for years that this cost counted as a prior

claim on pay, just as with the firm. ] may have been the only person to think so since
Quesnay and the physiocrats, although Mill and Sraffa might be interpreted that way.
But who has thought what doesn’t matter. Quesnay’s idea is a mathematical

possibility that must be addressed. I’ll get there soon.

Human capital is inalienable. That means that its decapitalization simplifies to
human depreciation. The firm’s added possibilities of depletion and liquidation
don’t apply. The output of human capital is called work. Then (6.1) through (6.8),

applied to human capital, give

earned revenue = pay - prior claims
= gross realized work
= realized work + recovered human depreciation. (6.15)

Such a fascination with the power of government-held secrets has always been a core concern of
radical libertarians. In his 1956 book The Torment of Secrecy: The Background and
Consequences of American Security Policies, the sociologist Edward Shils brilliantly dissects the
fascination with secrecy among individuals on all ends of the political spectrum who fear that
government agencies will use covert machinations against them. In Shils’ concept, this anti-
government counter-culture is “tormented” by the government’s possession of knowledge
unavailable to them. Those who subscribe to this culture tend to believe that the agencies that
hold these secrets, such as the FBI, CIA and NSA, can control their lives. The other side of this
torment over others holding secrets is the belief that by obtaining such secrets will give individuals
power over government.

Snowden himself was concerned with a coming “dark future,” which he later described as
follows: “[The elites] know everything about us and we know nothing about them — because they
are secret, they are privileged, and they are a separate class... the elite class, the political class,
the resource class — we don’t know where they live, we don’t know what they do, we don’t know
who their friends are. They have the ability to know all that about us. This is the direction of the
future but I think there are changing possibilities in this.”

To change the “dark future,” someone would have to know the secrets of the “elites.”

Snowden saw himself as one of the few individuals in a position to seize state secrets from those
elites. He had both a SCI, or Sensitive Compartmental Information, clearance, a pass into a NSA
regional base and the privileges of a system administrator. This position allowed him to steal state
secrets—and whatever power that went with them. And if he moved to a position that gave him
greater access, he would, in this view, amass even greater power.

Whatever his actual agenda in 2012, we know that he tested possible reactions to a leak
exposing NSA surveillance in the United States. He asked fellow workers at the NSA base in
2012, according to his own account: “What do you think the public would do if this [secret data]
was on the front page?” He asked this question at a time when a large number of State
Department and US Army classified documents had been posted on Julian Assange’s Wikileaks
website. While these Wikileaks revelations of secrets were making front-page headlines, the NSA
documents that Snowden had taken were far more explosive since they contained NSA
intelligence secrets. And no NSA document had ever been published in the press in 2012. One
reason why NSA documents remained secrets, as all intelligence workers at Dell were told when
they signed their oath, was that the unauthorized release of communications intelligence
documents could violate US espionage laws.

Even so, there was no shortage of activists overseas, such as Assange, who would be willing
to publish NSA documents revealing its global surveillance activities. And in answer to his
rhetorical question, he no doubt knew that they would cause an immense reaction on the front
page. Cyber punks, as these activists called themselves, tended to be hostile to the NSA since they
believed (correctly) that it monitored their activities on the Internet. This anti- NSA view was well

Stock view: Positive on Tinder monetization growth on new products

Match has continued to build monetization on Tinder and we expect a more widely
released Tinder Boost as well as international marketing spend to have a positive impact
in 1Q17 results. The incremental revenue increase combined with Core enhancements
should drive ARPU forward, though we are still cautious given Core’s declining to flat
growth and project 1Q17 at $.0.57 (-3% y/y).

Another issue on the horizon for Match group is the high ownership percentage of IAC.
Based on our discussions with management, this is a known issue from both Match and
IAC’s perspective. The high degree of IAC ownership limits the float and has created a
disproportionate short interest on the company to obtain higher exposure to IAC’s core
(ex-Match) properties. Our conversations suggest we can expect further discussion
from management on ways forward in 2017, with the most likely outcome, in our view, a
spin off IAC’s Match ownership to IAC shareholders.

As Tinder expands, one concern we have is that its highly diverse user base could cause
an overload of options and limit user’s ability to find the type of matches they are
looking for. An “elite” version of the app was recently launched called “Select” (per
TechCrunch}, highlighting the company’s focus on making sure users are able to find
suitable matches in different ways.

1Q17 should see international marketing spend on Tinder begin to pay off. We expect
that paid member count (PMC) will continue to trend up driven by Tinder and other
recent platforming initiatives helping to increase conversion on Core mobile and other
sites like Plenty of Fish (PoF) and Meetic.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: International PMC growth

Key for the quarter will be international PMC growth and we expect international to
grow 25% y/y to 2.3mn and overall PMC growth to be up 17% y/y to 5.9mn as Tinder
marketing outside of the US should start paying off. We are still cautious on ARPU and
expect modest declines of 3% y/y, we believe there is still upside potential here driven
by Tinder Boost, released in September 2016 and Core turnaround efforts. Key issues
for the call will be PMC growth, Tinder monetization and Core improvements.

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
¢ Decline in margins due to increased marketing of Tinder and Core improvement

¢ Drop in monetization as more consumers switch to mobile from PC.

¢ New investment initiatives drive down FY17 earnings projections.

Estimates vs. Consensus: Expect lower revenue, slight beat on profit

We are modeling rev/EBITDA of $293mn/S$78.5mn below the Street due to impact of
Princeton Review sell off but higher on EBITDA vs. the Street’s $307mn/S77mn
estimate. We estimate total PMCs of 5.9mn in 1Q and average revenue per users of
$0.527 down 3% y/y due to lower monetizing Tinder plans. With the sale of Princeton
review closing 3/31 and management moving any income to discontinued operations,
we have removed all non-Dating revenue from our model and believe our treatment of
these discontinued operations (totally excluded from our estimates) is the reason our
estimates are currently below the street.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021386.txt,"To give a robust account for the
practice of medicine, one must explain
why sick and debilitated strangers are
worthy of attention and care, and how
the medical arts contribute to human
flourishing. For some Americans, such
accounts begin in secular moral
tradition, but for most they begin in
religion; nine out of ten Americans
endorse a religious affiliation’. Either
way, medicine looks beyond science to
find a vision that animates care of the
sick, a moral framework that guides the
application of medical technology, and
practices that nurture and extend the
human capacity to care for patients as
persons rather than as mere objects. In
this sense, even though religious
concepts are rarely made explicit in
public and professional discourse about
medicine, they are everywhere implicit
and operative, and necessarily so.

Why care for the sick?

Humans in all cultures are moved
to care for the sick. The question is why?
The concept of the social brain provides
the beginning of an answer. The peculiar
human need and capacity for
constructive, complex and meaningful
relationships seems to involve
neurological structures and functions
that also facilitate attending to the sick.
For example, Epley describes the human
capacity to pay attention to our own
mindedness and the mindedness of
others. We are not only conscious of
ourselves, but we are conscious of others
being conscious of themselves and of us.
This capacity allows us to be mindful of
others’ bodily suffering and mindful of
their consciousness of our relation to
them in that suffering. To mindfulness is
added the capacity to empathize. Decety
describes a neurological structure
through which the sight of pain in
another person triggers a response in our

140

Page

own brains that mirrors (albeit at a level
attenuated by training and other
contextual factors) the response we
would have if we were suffering the pain
ourselves. These features of the human
brain allow us to pay attention to and to
some extent share in the suffering of
others—capacities that are psychological
building blocks for caring for the sick.

Yet to explain medicine strictly
on the basis of empirical science, one
must solve a particularly thorny version
of the more general problem of
explaining altruistic human behavior.
Decety notes, “The emergence of
altruism, of empathizing with and caring
for those who are not kin, is ... not
easily explained within the framework of
neo-Darwinian theories of natural
selection.” Indeed one can scarcely
imagine a practice less conducive to the
reproductive fitness of a population than
spending enormous resources caring for
the sick, the deformed, the weak, and the
aged. Natural selection and the physician
would seem to be at cross-purposes: one
works to eliminate the sickly, the other
to save them from elimination. On this
account, medicine appears to be the sort
of dead end into which the evolutionary
process sometimes blindly drifts.

Cacioppo, however, argues that
altruistic behaviors can be explained
within evolutionary theory by paying
attention to inclusive fitness and the
multiple levels of selective pressure:

...for species born to a period of
utter dependency [e.g., humans],
the genes that find their way into
the gene pool are not defined
solely or even mostly by
likelihood that an organism will
reproduce but by the likelihood
that the offspring of the parent
will live long enough to

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021392.txt,"Invisible Forces

Farr Curlin meditates on the
puzzle of medicine—what is its
evolutionary and social function, what
draws individual practitioners to it, and
what grounds its fundamental values.

The values of scientific inquiry lead to
treating the objects of inquiries in just
that way: as objects. But objectifying
patients and their disease would seem to
work against the human values of
empathy and caring for the weak that
also seems to be part and parcel of what
medicine is as a practice. Curlin argues
that religious values inform and nurture
the human side by insisting that there
must be a connection between physician
and patient, acting as an often
unrecognized invisible force that
humanizes the practice of medicine.

Religion is neither necessary nor
sufficient for an individual to adhere to
such values. The question of what it is
that grounds the fundamental values that
govern our relationships, and how those
values are reflected in invisible social,
psychological, and biological forces, is
central to the work of our network. Ina
concluding essay, Ronald Thisted
reflects on the many threads of
investigation and discussion that have
made up our conversation, and how they
are interwoven into a network of inquiry
that sheds light on invisible forces and
the social brain.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011057.txt,"Where Keynes and Kuznets and macroeconomic tradition have been right is in
reasoning that pay and gross profit, meaning gross of depreciation, sum to the
“expenditure” spent on consumption and gross investment. This fact of arithmetic is
the logic behind Say’s law: pay plus profit are always enough to buy what is
produced. We saw that this truism gives cold comfort when calamity or
misjudgment make profit negative, as with the subprime houses of 2008. What it

certifies, anyhow, is

expenditure = pay + gross profit = consumption + gross investment. (6.21)

We can subtract depreciation to reach

pay + profit = consumption + investment. (6.22)

Now (6.19) can be corrected as a whole to show

income = pay + profit + self-invested work - human depreciation
= output
= consumption - investment + self-invested work
— human depreciation. (6.23)

My main goal in this book has been to further the work of Solow in exogenizing
growth, and also the work of Ben-Porath in endogenizing human capital as
something produced within the economy. It was in that spirit that I derived the Y

rule in Chapters 2 and 5 by putting human capital inside. I reached

output = investment + human capital growth + cash flow.

Here “ex post net” is understood before output and investment, so that investment

means physical capital growth. (6.16) applies the growth truism to human capital.

The cash flow truism shows that cash flow is net transfer plus exhaust realized in

her long-time concerns about being watched by the government. “Your victimization by the NSA
system means that you are well aware of the threat that [the NSA’s] unrestricted, secret abilities
pose for democracies,” he continued. “I hope you understand that contacting you is extremely
high risk and if you are willing to agree to the following precautions before I share more, this will
not be a waste of your time.” Further heightening her concern that she was under surveillance, he
asked her to confirm to him “that no one has ever had a copy of your private key and that it uses a
strong passphrase.” Such precautions were necessary because “your adversary is capable of one
trillion guesses per second.” That “adversary” was, as she knew from her previous film, the NSA.
At this point, she knew she was entering into a dangerous liaison with an unknown party in
pursuit of NSA secrets.

To elude this “adversary,” Snowden stressed to her that she would have to adopt a
conspiratorial set of mind. “If the device you store the private key and enter your passphrase on
has been hacked, it is trivial to decrypt our communications,” he explained. “If you publish the
source material, I will likely be immediately implicated.” If her correspondent could be
“immediately implicated,” it meant that he was a person authorized to handle these secrets. So
Poitras knew, as early as January 2013 that she was creating an encrypted channel for someone
with access to NSA secrets and who would be incriminated by providing them to her.

The key source for Poitras’ previously-referred to short video was William Binney. Like her
new source, he had been authorized to handle NSA secrets. Binney had been a NSA technical
director until he had retired in 2001. The NSA’s domestic surveillance program that Binney told
the press about years before being interviewed in Poitras’ film was called “Stellar Wind.” It
indeed led to a major expose of domestic spying by the New York Times in December 2005. After
President Bush’s own Justice Department then held that such surveillance was illegal, Congress
passed a revision of the Patriot Act in 2007 that effectively legalize the “Stellar Wind”
surveillance program on condition that the NSA obtain a FISA warrant for it that would be
periodically reviewed by the Department of Justice.

Binney had never provided Poitras with any NSA documents to back up the charges he made
about Stellar Wind. He could not have done so without violating his sworn oath and, for that
matter, US anti-espionage statutes. Binney made it clear to her and other journalists that he was
not alaw breaker. But her new source, Snowden, was willing to do what Binney (and other
insiders) had refused to do. He was offering in these emails to provide her with secret
government documents even though it would implicate him as an outlaw. To further whet her
appetite, he told her that these up-to-date NSA documents would fully substantiate the allegations
that Binney made in her film. Even more important, he said Binney’s 2001 disclosures were still
relevant to her cause. “What you know as Stellar Wind has grown” he wrote her. In fact, as
Snowden knew from the draft Inspector-General report he stole in 2012 that Stellar Wind been
terminated in 2011 by the NSA for budgetary reasons. He continued: “The expanded special
source operations that took over Stellar Wind’s share of the pie have spread all over the world to

The House Of The Nobleman
Old Masters are hung in the company of some of the most notorious contemporary artists on the block in a show
opposite Frieze Art Fair
Text by John-Paul Pryor
For what is a man profited, if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul? Perhaps this is one question that
could be asked of any billionaire art collector. In The House of The Nobleman, artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz
examines our relationship to art and the role of the supposedly worldly or noble collector from a nonjudgemental
critical distance, and exhibits art both old and new (from Manet and Cézanne to The Chapmans and
Damien Hirst) in a show that promises to prove contentious. Here, Lenkiewicz’s own “resequenced” Picassos will
be exhibited against their original counterparts, effectively folding art history in upon itself to create an entirely
new kind of dialogue. Dazed Digital went down to his studio to talk nobility, history and the reasons why a lost
battle is a battle one thinks one has lost.
Dazed Digital: What is the concept that informs The House Of The Nobleman?
Wolfe von Lenkiewicz: When I started to plan the exhibition with the co-curator Victoria Golembiovskaya (by
whom I was fascinated because she was instrumental in manoeuvring a submarine in the grand canal in Venice), I
began to think about the notion of quality in the 21st century as opposed to the set of values pursued by Marsilio
Ficino. The dislocation and decertification of a stable position in the world, which was formally the aristocrat, the
king… the noble man. The artist, being perceived at the centre, was seen as a God, and within Ptolemaic
concentric rings one moved from dog, to angel, to God. This is a hierarchical linear model, which has been
attractive for five centuries in one form or another. The idea of this show is to explore a post-humanist form of
compassion – the world is dynamically changing, and no matter how flexible our map may be to quantify it, we
will be in an eternal struggle with meaning.

Posted: 14 October 2010 by Sarah Greenberg, RA Magazine Editor
Most people selling a property try to make it seem welcoming by brewing coffee and - at a stretch – baking bread.
But in a world gone mad for property and art, the stakes have been raised. How about a house that's been
'staged' (as they say Stateside) with a built-in art collection, including an eclectic array of work from Picasso to
Grayson Perry, Rodin to Richter, Manet to, predictably, Murakami, the artist who famously emblazoned his
designs on Louis Vuitton bags.
Yes, the £29m budget is a bit steep, but it needn't put you of from booking a tour to see this renovated mansion
in Cornwall Terrace that has been curated by Victoria Golemblovskaya and artist Wolfe Von Lenkiewicz, with the
participation of the Saatchi Collection and Channel 4.

15.10.2010
2 Cornwall Terrace, a magnificent 18th-century building off Regent’s Park and a stone’s throw from Frieze art fair,
will be the venue for this spectacular exhibition featuring Old Masters and famous names from contemporary art,
including Picasso, Manet, Cézanne, Damien Hirst, Banksy, Martin Kippenberger and Gerhard Richter. Work from
the Saatchi Gallery’s ‘New Sensations 2010 ‘ including jotta artist Joshua Bilton also on show.
The show imagines the house’s inhabitant as a hugely successful trader. Having used his mastery of technology
and the possibilities of the information age to amass vast wealth, he aspires to find a shaping narrative for the
etiolated form of his existence. Art is one of the avenues in his search.
He may live in a nobleman’s house, but he’s no blue blood. A tax exile, nomadic by habit, our collector spends his
days - and nights - bathed in the blue light of a computer screen, as he trades in dematerialized securities, or
prices options based on weather conditions on the other side of the globe: drowned cities viewed remotely via
CNN, or better, modelled via a computer simulation.
The roles of the nobleman and artist found a convergence in the figure of Don Quixote, a fool who aspired to the
chivalric codes he’d read about in antiquated texts. But this fantasy was a liberation; allowing him to contend with
base matter, infusing it with near-infinite possibilities, just as the empirical certainties of the Renaissance would
soon give way to the vertiginous perspectives of the new mathematics.
The exhibition updates the Don Quixote model to cast the collector/artist/nobleman as a man without qualities,
occupying the privileged space of the capitalist elite, looking down through a virtual window to plot the
constantly-changing vectors of matter, bodies and events as they hurtle by on the other side of the glass.

6m GBP worth of Picassos to go on show during Frieze 0
Posted on September 14, 2010 by Cindy Van Der Rijt
Four rare works by Picasso thought to be worth over £6m and an 1875 Cézanne oil on canvas will go on sale
during Frieze week next month in an ambitious exhibition to be held at a London property part owned by a
Russian billionaire. The show, entitled “The House of the Noble Man” (12-20 October), will open at 2 Cornwall
Terrace, an 18th-century building off Regent’s Park in London near to the Frieze Art Fair site. The exhibition is
curated by artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, whose works will feature in the display, and Russian curator Victoria
Golembiovskaya. Around £20m worth of art will be for sale, approximately a third of the show, confirms Von
Lenkiewicz.
According to the co-curator, the Picasso pieces on offer will include Buste d’Homme à la Pipe (1969, priced at
£3m); the 1905 drawing The Family of Saltimbanques and a cubist painting, Nature Morte au Gobelet (around

Future art stars cause a New Sensation
Louise Jury, Chief Arts Correspondent
15.10.10
Twenty artists hailed as stars of the future are getting the chance to show their work alongside that of 60 masters,
from Picasso and Warhol to Manet, Rodin and Cézanne.
The 20 were chosen from hundreds of graduate students in the New Sensations Prize, a contest now in its fourth
year, organised by Charles Saatchi's gallery and Channel 4.
Their work is part of The House of the Nobleman, an exhibition of art borrowed from international collections
that is being staged in an 18th-century mansion in Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park, a stone's throw from the
Frieze Art Fair.
Four of the graduates were selected to receive £1,000 bursaries to develop a project for inclusion. They are:
German Pablo Wendel, 30, whose degree work involved squatting in a derelict chip shop to which he built a
staircase, later dismantled by Royal College of Art staff in a health and safety row; Katie Surridge, 25, and Russian
Nika Neelova, 23, both Slade School graduates, and Ross M Brown, 24, who is still studying in Dundee. One of
them will be named this year's overall winner on Monday and the exhibition runs until Wednesday.
Rebecca Wilson, associate director of the Saatchi Gallery, said: “The 20 shortlisted artists have created a stunning
range of work, including
photography, painting, installation and sculpture. The exhibition offers a wonderful opportunity to discover the
bright stars of the future.”
More than half of the graduate artists are based in the capital. “London is still one of the best places to do a fine
art degree and has that reputation across the world, as well as being one of the most vibrant centres for
contemporary art,” Ms Wilson added.
New Sensations at the House of the Nobleman, 2 Cornwall Terrace, is open until Wednesday.

How art can make greed look fabulous
Olivia Cole
07.10.10
Literature's most sinister art connoisseur is probably Henry James's Gilbert Osmond, the collector of beautiful
objects to whom Isabel Archer shackles her fortunes in The Portrait of a Lady. She is at first dazzled by his advice
that “one ought to make one's life a work of art”, before realising that he has no imagination of his own, only
acquisitiveness: beauty by proxy. By that time, as his wife, she is part of his collection.
So how to spot a Gilbert Osmond today? You might imagine one lives in The House of the Nobleman, an
exhibition opening next week in a vast Edwardian pile on the borders of Regent's Park to coincide with the nearby
Frieze art fair.
Surveying the Ј20 million-worth of paintings, from Poussin to Warhol via Picasso, visitors are invited to believe
that they are in the house of an extravagantly committed collector. This imagined character is someone like
Randolph Hearst in Citizen Kane: a rich man with non-existent morals but exquisite taste. Like Dick Fuld, Lehman
Brothers' last CEO: earlier this month, it took Christie's days to sell off the bank's art collection.
Here there is no so such owner: this collection has been curated by two artists, Victoria Golembiovskaya and the
painter Wolfe von Lenkiewicz. The nobleman of their title is a modern-day Don Quixote, caught between fantasy
and reality. Von Lenkiewicz says City practices such as shorting have “no direct relationship to reality”. Their
modern-day nobleman hankers for meaning and order: beauty even. Hence the kind of people who fervently
collect in London. The compulsion to be known not only as loaded but cultured is often observed but rarely
examined. It's interesting that this show is staged by artists all of whom have a complex relationship with the kind
of people characterised by Vince Cable as merely “spivs and gamblers”. Wolfe refers to people who do
“unspeakable things” before reiterating that the show isn't a moral judgment.
Even so, their show tries to lift the veil on the activity at Frieze. As a centre for commercial art sustained still by
swilling disposable income, London eclipses Paris and New York. Frieze will be swarming with both people like me,
who go to look, and hundreds of the modern-day “noblemen” with their Black Amex cards. It's no small irony that
The House of the Nobleman naturally has its own massively wealthy backer, Russian property giant Mirax. Greed
might not be good but it sure can look fabulous.
And what about the savvier artists? Tracey Emin whines about arts cuts yet moans about her tax bill. Damien Hirst
has exploited the market in his own work as ruthlessly as any hedge-funder. Wolfe himself confidently discusses
algorithms and is a favourite of collectors such as Bono and Richard Devereux, co-founder of Virgin. London's
most successful artists aren't exactly in the gutter, looking at the stars.

£6m worth of Picassos to go on show during Frieze
The exhibition, to be held in a property co-owned by a Russian billionaire, also includes works by Warhol, Hirst,
Richter and Saatchi's New Sensations
By Gareth Harris | Web only
Published online 9 Sep 10 (News)
Four rare works by Picasso thought to be worth over £6m and an 1875 Cézanne oil on canvas will go on sale
during Frieze week next month in an ambitious exhibition to be held at a London property part owned by a
Russian billionaire. The show, entitled The House of the Noble Man (12-20 October), will open at 2 Cornwall
Terrace, an 18th-century building off Regent's Park in London near to the Frieze Art Fair site. The exhibition is
curated by artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, whose works will feature in the display, and Russian curator Victoria
Golembiovskaya. Around £20m worth of art will be for sale, approximately a third of the show, confirms Von
Lenkiewicz.
According to the co-curator, the Picasso pieces on offer will include Buste d'Homme à la Pipe (1969, priced at
£3m); the 1905 drawing The Family of Saltimbanques and a cubist painting, Nature Morte au Gobelet (around
1914). An 1875 oil on canvas by Cézanne, Don Quixote, is priced at £1.25m. Works by Yves Klein, Egon Schiele,
Gerhard Richter, Damien Hirst and Andy Warhol will also be for sale. Von Lenkiewicz's own works will be in the
£30,000-£60,000 price range.
The Picassos etc. are from anonymous dealers who will take their portion of the percentages. Any other
proceeds made during the show will go back into the funding of the exhibition which is hugely expensive despite
its sponsorship [by the Russian real estate company Mirax], adds Von Lenkiewicz. A selection of works from
Charles Saatchi's New Sensations 2010 roster of emerging artists will also be for sale. Twenty students
shortlisted for the prize, which is sponsored by Cadogan Tate, have been chosen to present their work; these
artists include Matthew Welch, Katie Sims and Pablo Wendel. A non-selling section will include works from the
London-based Zabludowicz Collection and the holdings of the Iraqi-born industrialist Ragdan El-akabi.
The show came about when I was in Moscow exhibiting my work at Triumph Gallery. Victoria took me to the
Mirax city project, a huge development in central Moscow. She talked to Sergei Polonsky [head of Mirax] about
the Cornwall Terrace buildings which he has shares in. He was willing to sponsor the show, says Von Lenkiewicz.
The Mirax group are co-developers of the Cornwall Terrace historical complex, parts of which are up for sale.

Elsewhere in London: what’s on and what to see
Published: October 13 2010 01:20 | Last updated: October 13 2010 01:20
With the absence of Zoo, the Pavilion of Art & Design (PAD) (until October 17; www.padlondon.net) will this year
play second fiddle to Frieze. This sophisticated fair of modern and contemporary art, design, photography and
tribal art from 1860 was conceived by Patrick Perrin and Stéphane Custot and is now in its fourth year. PAD has
retained its place in Berkeley Square, a site that offers limited space expansion, but a sought-after Mayfair
address.
As auction houses all jostle to cash in on the festival spirit, Christie’s is launching an initiative entitled Multiplied
(October 15-18; www.multipliedartfair.com) at its South Kensington saleroom. The focus of this fair is
contemporary art editions – photographs, prints, artists’ books and 3D multiples – and there will be big names,
including John Baldessari, Mat Collishaw and Gerald Laing, on sale for small prices.
Another example of canny innovation – or outsiders crashing the party – is House of the Nobleman at 2 Cornwall
Terrace (October 15-20; www.cornwallterrace.co.uk/boswallhouse). This is a property viewing with a difference:
not only is the house itself on the market, but so is much of the art – including works by Pablo Picasso, Helen
Chadwick and Grayson Perry – that decorates its interior.
While the majority of Frieze Week events take place in grandiose settings in London’s West End, a couple of
contrasting fairs are capitalising on sites in the city’s East End. The Future Can Wait (until October 17;
www.thefuturecanwait.com), an alternative fair started by trusted talent-spotters Zavier Ellis and Simon Rumley,
returns to Shoreditch Town Hall for the fourth year running.

HERE COMES FRIEZE WEEK
Oct. 8, 2010
Here it comes. Next week, Oct. 14-17, 2010, is London’s time to shine like the diamond it is in the international
art-market sun, as Frieze Week bows in the British super-city. With dozens of events and most of the best
galleries making the trip, the whole thing is exhausting just to think about. Here, then, a quick-and-dirty summary
of some of the highlights. We’re sure we’ve missed a few, but this’ll do to start:
FRIEZE
Of course the centerpiece, as usual, is the Frieze Art Fair itself, going up in Regent’s Park. The selection is topnotch,
with some 173 exhibitors on board, including most of the top dealers you’d expect.
MORE, MORE, MORE
Much more is going on, including big events like the launch of Ai Weiwei’s Turbine Hall installation at Tate
Modern. We, however, prefer to focus on some of the freakier offerings.
Or what about the The Museum of Everything in Primrose Hill, which was regarded as the most successful new
addition to the Frieze scene last year (according to the Independent). For the third exhibition at the space,
opening Oct. 13, Pop art pioneer Peter Blake curates a show of outsider art and artifacts, including pieces by
Morton Bartlett, James Castle, Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez. During Frieze Week, contemporary art stars
like Bob & Roberta Smith, Polly Morgan and Jeremy Deller are scheduled for various tours and talks at the
Museum. Worth a swing by.
Then there is the mysterious House of the Noble Man, Oct. 12-20, at 2 Cornwall Terrace, an 18th-century building
off Regent’s Park, near Frieze. What exactly this show is remains unclear, but it is some kind of conceptual selling
exhibition, sponsored by the Russian billionaire who owns the property, and curated by artist Wolfe von
Lenkiewicz with Russian curator Victoria Golembiovskaya. Lenkiewicz, for his part, describes it as a curatorial
concept playing with the idea of commerce, mirroring the [art] market with irony. The Art Newspaper reports
that some £20-million in art will be for sale, including works by Picasso and Cézanne, as well as a selection of
works from Charles Saatchi’s New Sensations 2010 roster of emerging artists, and the holdings of the Iraqi-born
industrialist Ragdan El-akabi.

LONDON DISPATCH
by Laura K. Jones
Powerless against the magnetic force towing them in to the bowels of Regent’s Park, 60,000 visitors to the eighth
edition of the Frieze Art Fair were faced with a decision. What to buy from an array of works whose combined
price came to $365 million?
Would it be The True Artist Helps the World by Revealing Mystic Truths, a sprawling Damien Hirst cabinet
containing a school of pickled fish, priced at $5.6 million? The huge work turned out to be the star sale of the fair,
as was widely reported, when it was flogged immediately from the White Cube stand during the Frieze preview.
Apparently, the cynical press refers to the vernissage as Billionaires Day, and indeed, attendees included Claudia
Schiffer, Charles Saatchi, Steve Cohen (a first timer to the fair) and Dasha Zhukova.
So powerful has Frieze become that commercial galleries, public spaces and auction houses now tie their activities
to it more than ever. Off-site auctions saw Phillips de Pury selling David Hockney’s Autumn Pool for $2 million and
Christie’s flogging Andreas Gursky’s photograph of the New York Stock Exchange for $700,000, almost three times
its estimate.
Harry Blain and Graham Southern, former directors of Haunch of Venison, inaugurated their new gallery,
BlainSouthern, with Creation Condemned, a hypnotic and troubling show by Mat Collishaw of images of pole
dancers, frenzied burning butterflies and the great ravines that were left when the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan
Buddhas. Fusing symbols of decadence and decay, Collishaw makes lithophanes -- in this case, images etched in
thin, translucent Corian, lit from behind with slowly pulsating lights. Blain and Southern afterwards invited the art
world to the Ivy Club until the early hours of the next morning.
Then, it was onwards and upwards to The House of the Noble Man, a super-slick exhibition in an 18th-century
Cornwall Terrace townhouse near to the Frieze site (an address, according to the Art Newspaper, thought to be
being prepped for sale to former U.S. president Bill Clinton) that was co-curated by polymath artist Wolfe
Lenkiewicz and Victoria Golembiovskaya. The show felt like serious money, including as it did Andy Warhol works
I’d never even seen images of before, plus things by Poussin, Manet, Cézanne, Picasso, Hirst and Kippenberger.
Over its five floors, Noble Man also housed work from the Saatchi Gallery's New Sensations 2010 exhibition of
graduating students. Stand-out pieces included So Over, a room full of animal hides by Kate Surridge, a sculpture
student at Slade School, and I Used to Think, an exceptional cautionary film about the bleeding-eyed X Factor
generation by a man called Lee Holden. Amazingly sinister, the slo-mo montage included images of Britney
Spears, a live lobotomy, a childlike Japanese robot and a woman suffering paranoid delusions, all to a haunting
soundtrack of modern music and computer sounds.

ARTINFO UK's Guide to Frieze Week 2010
By Coline Milliard, ARTINFO UK
Published: October 11, 2010
LONDON— Frieze Week is upon us! Europe's largest contemporary art fair has staked its tent in Regent’s Park,
bringing with it an estimated $375 million in work by brand-name artists and emerging talents alike, and London
is seething with exhibitions and events to welcome the collectors, tastemakers, and various art grandees
descending on the city. What to see? Where to go? ARTINFO UK has a few recommendations.
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13 With still two days to go before Frieze Art Fair opens to the public, today is the perfect
day to indulge in a bit of London tourism, mixing in visits to the city's West End galleries. Stroll down Piccadilly
and stop at Thomas Dane Gallery, on Duke Street, for the Kelley Walker exhibition. On Heddon Street — a
continental oasis at the heart of Central London — Aicon Gallery has put together an excellent exhibition
retracing artist and thinker Rasheed Araeen’s first fifteen years of production, beginning in 1959. Two other good
shows on the same street are Paola Pivi at Carlson and Jimmie Durham at Sprovieri. You can also discover Sadie
Coles’ new space in New Burlington Place, inaugurated with an exhibition of Urs Fisher’s sculptures.
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14 You’ve done Tate Britain, do you really need to go to Tate Modern? Of course you do.
First, the newly opened Gauguin exhibition is stunning and simply impossible to miss (it has been described by
the Times as the show of the season — in fact of the whole year). Second, the new commission by Ai Weiwei,
was recently unveiled in Turbine Hall. You can then head north to enjoy Fergus Henderson’s English cuisine at St.
John Bar & Restaurant in Smithfield, before wandering to ROKEBY for their exhibition of German-born, Londonbased
artist Bettina Buck.
Today is also a good day to see The House of the Noble Man, an exhibition curated by artist Wolfe von
Lenkiewicz and Russian curator Victoria Golembiovskayan. It includes a Cézanne, £6 million ($9.6 million) worth of
Picasso, as well as pieces by Damien Hirst, Christian Boltanski, Andy Warhol, Gerhard Richter, and many more —
all in the historical setting of Cornwall Terrace as it overlooks Regent’s Park. (This event is by appointment only at
Boswell House, 2 Cornwall Terrace, Regents Park, London NW1. To arrange a visit, register at:

Rare Picasso works worth over £6m to be sold in October auction alongside Hirst and Warhol
Four pieces by the Cubist painter go on sale next month and could see record prices
Regent's Park in London is set to be the home of four very special artworks by the world renowned Spanish artist
Pablo Picasso.
The works, believed to worth over £6m ($9.3m) will be exhibited as part of a show called The House of the Noble
Man which is running from October 12 to 20 at 2 Cornwall Terrace in Regents park, London.
The works will go on sale alongside an 1875 Cézanne oil on canvas work, during Frieze week.
According to the co-curator of the exhibit, the four Picasso works on offer will include a 1905 drawing entitled
The Family of Saltimbanques, a 1914 Cubist painting titled Nature Morte au Gobelet and the 1969 piece
Buste d'Hommeà la Pipe which is currently price at £3m ($4.6).
In addition to this the exhibit will have works by Yves Klein, Gerhard Richter, Egon Schiele and the more familiar
names of Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst.
The Picasso works are believed to have come from anonymous dealers, whilst a selection of pieces has also come
from Charles Saatchi's New Sensations 2010 roster of emerging artists.
However, for many collectors the undoubted focus of the event will be the four works by Picasso.
Picasso's work is arguably some of the most valued and collectible on the market due to his position as a pioneer
and co-creator of the artistic form of Cubism.
There works subverted the traditional notion of painting an object, instead breaking them up and re-assembling
them in a abstract work to create an ambiguous and thought provoking piece of art.

House of Noble Man
Oct 18, 2010 04:06:00 PM by Sarah Bailey
I love the extraordinary and intriguing exhibitions which one encounters around the edges of Frieze. 2009's The
Age of the Marvellous at One Marylebone (curated by AVA) was one such discovery - dark and theatrical - which
stayed with me all year...
This year's House of Noble Man (a collaboration between the Saatchi Gallery and Channel 4's New Sensations), is
another spectacular show of a very different flavour mounted in No. 2 Cornwall Terrace, a gleaming showcase of
super-prime real-estate. (I attended on the opening night and was treated to a tour of two other oligarch-ready
show mansions at No.6 and 11 Cornwall Terrace, by a dashing Knight Frank estate agent by the name of Darren
Daggers... Quite surreal, but, of course, an incredibly resonant statement about the current art market).
Back at No. 2 Cornwall Terrace, House of Noble Man curated by Victoria Golembiovskaya and artist-of-themoment
Wolfe Von Lenkiewicz mixes work from the giants of modern art - Cezanne and Picasso - with some
dazzling and provocative contemporary pieces plus, of course, Channel 4's New Sensations discoveries.
I loved the filigree Cement Truck sculpture by Wim Delvoye (the Belgian conceptual artist probably best-known
for his work in the 90s involving the tattooing of live pigs), Rachel Whiteread's dolls house chess set and New
Sensation Elizabeth Jordan's dream-like kinetic installation, which she is showing in an upper bedroom. Of course,
there's nothing like a Frieze party to lure out London's finest exhibitions and I was very pleased to meet showgoer
Philip Levine, who uses his bald pate (bejeweled on this occasion as though he is wearing a Swarovski swim cap)
as his canvas. His next show, he informs me, is being sponsored by Gilette...
House of Noble Man is on until
Wednesday October 20, so do try and
see it. Entry is free, but you have to
book an appointment.

Art in Residence: Redeveloped park terrace hosts exhibit
By Deirdre Hipwell
Sunday, 10 October 2010
Curators Victoria Golembiovskaya and Wolfe Von Lenkiewicz, in collaboration with the Saatchi Gallery and
Channel 4's New Sensations, will host an art exhibition starting next Sunday showcasing famous works by artists
such as Paul Cezanne and Pablo Picasso.
The House of the Nobleman exhibit, which coincides with the Frieze Art Fair, will be held at the mansion No 2
Cornwall Terrace in Regents Park and will include works from several international art collections. No 2 Cornwall
Terrace has been extensively redeveloped by developer Oakmayne Bespoke and is part of a much larger
redevelopment of Cornwall Terrace to create eight mansions. The houses are up for sale starting at £29m.

Frieze Art Fair 2010: Get ready for British art's biggest week
Frieze Art Fair is back – and it's bigger than ever, with 173 international galleries. Alice Jones looks forward to this
year's event and the week-long whirl of auctions, exhibitions and parties it brings to London
Friday, 8 October 2010
As always, the proof will be in the purchasing, but signs that confidence has returned to the market can already
be found in the buzz around the traditional run of Frieze week auctions. At Christie's, Hirst will be auctioned
alongside two works by Gerhard Richter (valued at up to £1m) and, hollow laugh, Andreas Gursky's
photomontage of the New York Stock Exchange, last seen hanging in the boardroom at Lehman Brothers
(estimate: £100,000 – £150,000). Sotheby's has Jerry Hall's extraordinary collection up for sale – including work by
Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud and Andy Warhol. And Phillips de Pury will hope to break the £1m mark with David
Hockney's Autumn Pool while Maurizio Cattelan's Una Domenica a Rivara, a rope of knotted bedsheets to hang
from a window, is estimated to sell at £400,000 to £600,000. Elsewhere, in a bold new addition to the landscape,
£20m-worth of art will go on sale in an 18th-century mansion part-owned by the Russian real-estate billionaire
Sergei Polonsky. The House of the Noble Man, a stone's throw from Frieze in Cornwall Terrace, is curated by
Victoria Golembiovskaya and the artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and will include four rare Picassos and Cezanne's
Don Quixote.
For all of these and more, the international arterati will descend on London next week, jetting in from the
traditional hot spots of New York, Berlin and Moscow, as well as from the emerging collector territories of the
Middle East, India and China for what is now known simply as Frieze week. It's no longer just about the fair; a
whole city's-worth of cultural activity has coalesced around those big white marquees. The breakfast views are
booked in, the big museum shows are up and the parties – from a Frieze week opener at the Groucho Club to the
ritzy annual Cartier dinner at Bar Boulud and ArtReview's Power 100 party at Sketch – are planned. After its initial
struggles, the hype-filled boom years and fear-filled bust years, Frieze is now firmly established, an unmissable
stop-off between Basel and Miami on the global art calendar. A decade ago, London didn't even have its own
contemporary art fair. Now, for five days in mid- October, the art set wouldn't dream of being anywhere else.

The Art Market: a house party
2010-Oct-11
By Georgina Adam www.google.co.uk
“Frieze week” kicks off this week in London, drawing the cream of the art world to Britain’s capital.
It is centred of course on the fair that started it all (Frieze opens to the public in Regent’s Park on
Thursday), but a host of satellite events are also on offer. One of the more intriguing is taking place
just down the road from the fair, at 2 Cornwall Terrace, part of an enormously expensive real estate
project being developed and sold.
In what appears to be a sophisticated way of selling both art and the property, the 18th-century
mansion is being used as a temporary venue for an exhibition entitled The House of the Nobleman,
October 15-20. The format is hybrid, both commercial and non-commercial, with 68 works on show,
half of them loans from collectors – one is David Roberts, the rest are secret – the other half consisting
of works of art for sale.
The House of the Nobleman is curated by the artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, who has teamed up with a
young Russian curator, Victoria Golembiovskaya. It is backed by Mirax, a Russian real estate company
that has a “significant but minority” stake in the Cromwell Terrace complex. Mirax belongs to a
Russian billionaire, Sergei Polonsky, but Mirax has been troubled since the financial recession and has
a reported $120m in debt; the firm did not respond to a request for comment. The eight houses in the
Cromwell Terrace complex are priced between £29m and £60m.
Various dealers, from the UK and elsewhere, are contributing works of art to the show; they range
from two paintings by Poussin to Picasso’s “Buste d’Homme à la Pipe” (1969), priced at £3m. Banksy,
Richter, Klein, Rodin, Cézanne and Warhol are the unlikely bedfellows in the show, which includes two
works by Von Lenkiewicz himself (at £60,000 and £50,000) and about 22 consigned by Charles Saatchi.
While entry is free, visitors must register for admission (www.cornwallterrace.co.uk); they will be
taken around in groups of 50, according to the curators.

The Inferno in the Frieze
Thursday, October 14th, 2010
As Frieze mania draws to a close, the capital is playing host to a number of enthralling and original surrounding
exhibitions and events this weekend.
The labyrinth of tunnels beneath Waterloo Station have been taken over by the Lazarides Gallery, who have
installed a mind blowing exhibition called ‘Hell’s Half Acre’. The space has been transformed into a large-scale
evocation of Dante’s literary masterpiece Inferno in which a group of young, cutting-edge artists have produced a
multi-sensory interpretation of hell, a strange consort of voodoo dolls, taxidermy, suspended bodies and barking
staffies. For something a little lighter, seek out Conor Harrington’s fleet of suspended model ships and their
shadows, as well a Jonathan Yeo nude in 3D. Until 17th October.
Catch the ‘Anticipation Show’ in Selfridges’ Ultra-lounge. It has fast become a celebrated, annual showcase of the
hottest artists of the moment, and is curated by Kay Saatchi and Catriona Warren. Photographers Noemie Goudal
and Robin Friend make stunning contributions with their antithetical takes on the natural landscape. And painter
Robert Dowling is no doubt a star in the making material with his clean, monochromatic wall pieces. With
arresting video installations and jaw dropping sculptural work from Blue Curry on show too, get yourself down
there for a glimpse of the future. Until 10th November.
For a star studded affair with big names and big pieces, check out ‘The House of the Nobleman’. A special
exhibition curated by ‘All Visual Arts’ Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria Golembiovskaya, you’ll see heralded
gems from the likes of Edouard Manet and Picasso jostle alongside iconic Yves Klein and Ron Arad design pieces.
The makers and shakers of Modern and Contemporary art await your perusal. Rarely will see you such a
heavyweight list of artists all showing under one roof. Until 20th October at Boswall House, 2 Cornwall Terrace,
Regent’s Park, NW1. By appointment only.

Cadogan Tate Sponsors ‘New Sensations’ Art Exhibition
(PRWEB) October 17, 2010
Cadogan Tate, the world class art moving, storage and shipping specialist in contemporary art, has sponsored the
‘New Sensations 2010’ exhibition for UK art students. Organised by Channel 4 and The Saatchi Gallery, this
prestigious event aims to discover the most imaginative and talented artists graduating from BA and MA courses
in the UK and to support students leaving art college.
A total of 20 students were shortlisted to present their work in the exhibition. This is being held at Boswall House,
2 Cornwall Terrace - a magnificent 18th century building off Regent’s Park - from 14th to 20th October. The event
forms part of ‘The House of the Nobleman’, under the curatorship of Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria
Golembiovskaya.
Four of the finalists in New Sensations 2010 - Pablo Wendel, Katie Surridge, Nika Neelova and Ula Wiznerowicz -
have each been given a bursary to develop a new work for the exhibition. A short film about each of them was
aired on Channel 4 in early October.
Stephen Glynn, Cadogan Tate’s Fine Art Director, comments: “We are delighted to be the sponsors of this
important exhibition, which showcases the talent of some remarkable young artists. We have spent many years
transporting and storing the world's most precious contemporary art for leading museums, galleries and
collectors. It therefore seemed very appropriate that we should support and encourage the UK’s leading art
students through this exciting event.”

ARTINFO UK's Guide to Frieze Week 2010
Posted: October 12, 2010 03:11 PM
Frieze Week is upon us! Europe's largest contemporary art fair has staked its tent in Regent's Park, bringing with it
an estimated $375 million in work by brand-name artists and emerging talents alike, and London is seething with
exhibitions and events to welcome the collectors, tastemakers, and various art grandees descending on the city.
What to see? Where to go? ARTINFO UK has a few recommendations.
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14
You've done Tate Britain, do you really need to go to Tate Modern? Of course you do. First, the newly opened
Gauguin exhibition is stunning and simply impossible to miss (it has been described by the Times as the show of
the season -- in fact of the whole year). Second, the new commission by Ai Weiwei, was recently unveiled in
Turbine Hall. You can then head north to enjoy Fergus Henderson's English cuisine at St. John Bar & Restaurant in
Smithfield, before wandering to ROKEBY for their exhibition of German-born, London-based artist Bettina Buck.
Today is also a good day to see The House of the Noble Man, an exhibition curated by artist Wolfe von
Lenkiewicz and Russian curator Victoria Golembiovskayan. It includes a Cézanne, £6 million ($9.6 million) worth of
Picasso, as well as pieces by Damien Hirst, Christian Boltanski, Andy Warhol, Gerhard Richter, and many more --
all in the historical setting of Cornwall Terrace as it overlooks Regent's Park. (This event is by appointment only at
Boswell House, 2 Cornwall Terrace, Regents Park, London NW1. To arrange a visit, register at:
http://www.cornwallterrace.co.uk/boswallhouse/).

The House of the Nobleman
Yes But Is It Art?
An Elegant Madness: High Society in Regency England
Saturday morning. What to do what to do? Fortunately a rather nice invite has arrived to the mysteriously named
House of the Nobleman. It's Before Midday and North of The River but said nobleman is allegedly a Russian
billionaire so it's hard to say no. Plus champers and canapés are champers and canapés. And it’s a gallery in a
house so really we have to check out the competition.
http://www.oakmayneproperties.com
“Highlight of Freeze!” shouts the press release. We’ll see. First impressions are good. The house is on the Outer
Circle of The Regent’s Park and just like the theatre that’s the place to be hot. Important looking girl asks us have
we been invited. “Qu’est-ce que c’est?”
Indoors, the ceilings are surprisingly low for us six footers. The interior designer clearly has a penchant for egg-&-
dart cornicing. It’s everywhere, except where it’s broken by over-scaled doors. Marble bathrooms, lit stair treads,
shiny black kitchen. It’s all a bit bling for Lavender’s Blue taste and we don’t really do Post 1900 anyway.
But my gosh the art on display reads like a Who’s Who list. Here’s a tour:
Is it Art or is it a Chair? asks Zelda in a loud stage whisper
But where's the Bubbly?

£6m worth of Picassos to go on show during Frieze
Gareth Harris, October 15, 2010
Four rare works by Picasso thought to be worth over £6m and an 1875 Cézanne oil on canvas will go on sale
during Frieze week next month in an ambitious exhibition to be held at a London property part owned by a
Russian billionaire. The show, entitled The House of the Noble Man (12-20 October), will open at 2 Cornwall
Terrace, an 18th-century building off Regent's Park in London near to the Frieze Art Fair site. The exhibition is
curated by artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, whose works will feature in the display, and Russian curator Victoria
Golembiovskaya. Around £20m worth of art will be for sale, approximately a third of the show, confirms Von
Lenkiewicz.
According to the co-curator, the Picasso pieces on offer will include Buste d'Homme à la Pipe (1969, priced at
£3m); the 1905 drawing The Family of Saltimbanques and a cubist painting, Nature Morte au Gobelet (around
1914). An 1875 oil on canvas by Cézanne, Don Quixote, is priced at £1.25m. Works by Yves Klein, Egon Schiele,
Gerhard Richter, Damien Hirst and Andy Warhol will also be for sale. Von Lenkiewicz's own works will be in the
£30,000-£60,000 price range. The Picassos etc. are from anonymous dealers who will take their portion of the
percentages. Any other proceeds made during the show will go back into the funding of the exhibition which is
hugely expensive despite its sponsorship [by the Russian real estate company Mirax], adds Von Lenkiewicz. A
selection of works from Charles Saatchi's New Sensations 2010 roster of emerging artists will also be for sale.
Twenty students shortlisted for the prize, which is sponsored by Cadogan Tate, have been chosen to present their
work; these artists include Matthew Welch, Katie Sims and Pablo Wendel. A non-selling section will include works
from the London-based Zabludowicz Collection and the holdings of the Iraqi-born industrialist Ragdan El-akabi.
The show came about when I was in Moscow exhibiting my work at Triumph Gallery. Victoria took me to the
Mirax city project, a huge development in central Moscow. She talked to Sergei Polonsky [head of Mirax] about
the Cornwall Terrace buildings which he has shares in. He was willing to sponsor the show, says Von Lenkiewicz.
The Mirax group are co-developers of the Cornwall Terrace historical complex, parts of which are up for sale.
Ironically the exhibition, awash with blue-chip items, is meant to reflect the typical tastes of a 21st-century
collector who may well treat art as a commodity. The notion of the noble man with sangre azul, [with] blue
blood developing a blue-grey skin tone from eating off the family silver, has prevailed for centuries. But this idea
is bankrupt, outmoded. Our collector spends his days and nights bathed in the blue light of a computer screen, as
he trades in dematerialised securities, or price options based on weather conditions on the other side of the
globe, according to a press statement. It is important that the show comes across strongly as a curatorial
concept playing with the idea of commerce, mirroring the [art] market with irony. We based the idea around
nobility and bankrupt values in a post humanist age, says Von Lenkiewicz.

The House of the Noble Man
October 18th, 2010
This presentation of works by some of the world’s best known artists was intended more as a showcase for the
incredible property in which it took place than for the art itself. The eight residences in this newly redeveloped
Regency terrace happen to be on the market at the moment and, with the Frieze Art Fair taking place a stone’s
throw away in Regent’s Park, this was a perfect opportunity to entice wealthy collectors to view a potential home
or pied-à-terre.
The House of the Noble Man is supposed to evoke the home of a fictitious 21st century merchant – a digital
tycoon, trader and investor who collects art as a way of lending materiality to his otherwise transient and
ethereal existence.
Only the best will do in this sort of setting and curators Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria Golembiovskaya
managed to procure an astonishing selection of pieces including paintings, sculpture and installation works by
Yves Klein, Alexander Calder, Gerhard Richter, Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin and Banksy.
Contemporary design furniture from Carpenters Workshop Gallery helped to remind the visitor that you were in a
home rather than a gallery.
Also included in the presentation were the works of the four finalists from Channel 4 and the Saatchi Gallery’s
New Sensations 2010, a prize for artists graduating from UK art courses.
It would be impossible not to be impressed by the ambition and quality of this presentation and it certainly
provided a refreshingly serene and luxurious experience in comparison to the mêlée down the road at Frieze.
However, there was something uncomfortable about viewing all of this wonderful art in what was, in essence, the
world’s most expensive show home. I guess the true success of this exhibition will be determined by whether any
of the properties sell and, for me, art should be treated as more than a sales tool.

We made it to Paris for fiac which as usual was a delightfully elegant experience. Paris for the day by

We loved at Mitchell-Innes & Nash William Pope. L’s performance: three world leaders holding a hugelooking
meteorite excreting dye all over them at their own command......
Francis Chantala would not let me look at the Josh Smith paintings he was being most difficult.
There are some strange sights at art fairs: a woman artist dragging around a Louis Vuitton dustbin.
Perhaps she was hoping someone would drop in a nice little unwanted designer package into her bin.
We dropped by to see Jim Lambie in his show in Paris. My amazing designer friend Jean Pierre Tortil,
Elliot Mcdonald and Jim.
Back to London and we visited Wolfe Lenkiewicz at his show The House of the Noble Man. It was a very
lovely show in a lavish £50 million home in Regents Park.
We found on the top floor a lovely work by Matthew Welch called In The Glass Coffin of the Virgin
Forest, the artist was one of Channel 4s New Sensations.

frieze art fair: a glass guide
Our online art team pick out what – and who – to watch out for at this year’s fair
Posted: 12 October 2010
Despite the difficult last two years, Frieze is playing host to some big numbers this time around. Christie's will hold
its annual October Post-War and Contemporary Art evening auction, with the top lot - I Am Become Death,
Shatterer of Worlds, a butterfly canvas by Damien Hirst – going for an estimated £2.5m-£3.5m. Other notable
sales to watch out for are Andreas Gursky's photomontage of the New York Stock Exchange, last seen hanging in
the boardroom at Lehman Brothers (estimate: £100,000 – £150,000), and Sotheby’s sales from Jerry Hall's
extraordinary collection, which includes work by Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud and Andy Warhol.
The fair’s fringe is looking more diverse than ever this year. For quiet classicism, The House of the Noble Man, a
stone's throw away in Cornwall Terrace, is a definite highlight. Curated by Victoria Golembiovskaya and the artist
Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, it will include four rare Picassos and Cezanne's Don Quixote. Meanwhile, purveyors
looking for modern artist-led work should head to Screening. An independent art exhibition on 203-205
Brompton Road – a purpose-built exhibition space within a Knightsbridge office block – rising stars will be
showing alongside heavyweight Toby Ziegler and much-talked about video artist Ryan Trecartin. The temporal
format of video art will be considered in this sprawling building as an extension of work on canvas – with the help
of some of London’s brightest new young painters.
There are a few satellite fairs for the collectors craving boutique shopping after getting an eyeful at the main
event. The Pavilion of Art and Design will be returning to Berkeley Square, Mayfair, for the fourth year running,
featuring 50 distinguished international dealers of modern art, design, decorative arts, photography, jewellery
and tribal art. SUNDAY, a free three-day event in Marylebone's Ambika P3, is shaping up to be an intriguing
replacement to Zoo,, according to the Independent. Sponsored by the Zabludowicz Collection, it features 20 upand-coming
galleries from all over the world. Whitechapel Gallery is also making some noise on the periphery,
displaying works from the D.Daskalopoulos collection in Greece – one of the foremost collections of
contemporary art in Europe.

Timothy Barber has a look around Frieze Art Fair, which opens to the public today
AS an army of glamorous art industry movers and shakers traipsed into Frieze Art Fair’s marquee yesterday, a
young woman was standing outside distributing paper leaflets for an upcoming exhibition. Not that surprising
perhaps – some galleries need all the help they can get publicising themselves – except that the gallery in
question was the Royal Academy. That London’s most august art institution should find itself flyering outside a
tent in Regent’s Park is one measure of the extent to which the capital’s art scene now triangulates itself around
Frieze.
There are others. The National Gallery’s new exhibition of works by the 18th century Venetian artist Canaletto has
coincided with Frieze this week; the merry-go-round of satellite exhibitions now includes one from The Saatchi
Gallery – its owner, Charles Saatchi, practically gave birth to London’s contemporary art scene as we know it, after
all – called The House of the Noble Man, in a residence near Frieze, which puts Cezanne, Manet, Poussin and
Picasso alongside Richter, Murakami and Hirst; and of course, Frieze now dictates the timing of the contemporary
art auctions that are the most immediate signifier of the health – or otherwise – of the art market.
As far as that goes, Anders Petterson, managing director of art market analyst ArtTactic, says the mood is
cautiously optimistic. After a rotten 2009, record-breaking February sales apparently signified a return to business
as normal, but momentum slowed in the summer with some shows falling significantly short.
“People got carried away with the rebound earlier in the year and sellers got a little greedy with the estimates
they demanded, so the summer sales were a bit down,” Petterson says. “Since then the market has revived a bit,
and people are being more realistic about the situation.”

FRIEZE 2010

This year’s annual London Frieze 2010 was the strongest Frieze fair since the global economic collapse that began
in autumn 2008. Frieze 2010 saw noticeable increases in artwork sales activity; better certainly than the last two
Frieze fairs. Good or bad, these temporary exhibits in ritzy mansions in central London’s most expensive
neighborhoods, are a far cry from the gritty underground art happenings of earlier alternative venues.
Temporarily setting up in fashionablecentral London locales walking distance to Frieze’s fair grounds inside
Regent Park is admittedly an ultra commercial way to sell art.
After all, one might argue, the aim of selling art is the same whether in a humble fair booth, or an exaggerated
mansion. This author admits to attending two suchevents, one in a historic townhouse former embassy of an
African nation,[1] the other in a newly built super-luxury home with not only artwork for purchase but also the
venue – a newly built marble fixtured mansion in Regent’s Park itself for sale, with a price tag of50 million
dollars.[2] The former showed newly commissioned works made especially for the exhibition by a variety of
contemporary artists including Jake and Dinos Chapman, Tim Noble and Sue Webster and Wim Delvoye.
The latter showed everyone from Cezanne to Rodin to Zeng Fanzhi and Yin Zhaoyang, and felt more like a
collective effort of secondary market sale works consigned from various dealers and owners. The artworks one
assumes are used to make the house-for-sale more beautiful and presumably also more sale-able. Interesting
Russian contemporary works were also included, fueling rumors of Russian financial backing for the Regent’s Park
situated mansion-for sale-with-or-without- artworks.

BREYER, J., dissenting

many organizations contracted in scope in 1952, when the
State Department modified foreign government immunity
to exclude commercial activities. Most organizations could
not rely on the treaty provisions quoted above to supply
the necessary immunity. That is because, unless the
treaty provision granting immunity is “self-executing,” 1.e.,
automatically applicable, the immunity will not be effec-
tive in U.S. courts until Congress enacts additional legis-
lation to implement it. See Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S.
491, 504-505 (2008); but see id., at 546-547 (BREYER, J.,
dissenting). And many treaties are not self-executing.
Thus, in the ordinary case, not even a treaty can guaran-
tee immunity in cases arising from commercial activities.

The UN provides a good example. As noted, the UN
Charter required the United States to grant the UN all
“necessary” immunities, but it was not self-executing. In
1946, the UN made clear that it needed absolute immu-
nity from suit, including in lawsuits based upon its commer-
cial activities. See Convention on Privileges and Immuni-
ties of the United Nations, Art. II, §2, Feb. 18, 1946, 21
U.S. T. 1422, T. I. A. S. No. 6900 (entered into force Apr.
29, 1970); see also App. to S. Exee. Rep. No. 91-17, p. 14
(1970) (The U.N.’s immunity from legal process extends
to matters arising out its commercial dealings ...”). But,
until Congress ratified that comprehensive immunity
provision in 1970, no U.S. law provided that immunity
but for the Immunities Act. Jd., at 1. Both the UN and
the United States found this circumstance satisfactory
because they apparently assumed the Immunities Act
extended immunity in cases involving both commercial
and noncommercial activities: When Congress eventually
(in 1970) ratified the UN’s comprehensive immunity pro-
vision, the Senate reported that the long delay in ratifica-
tion “appears to have been the result of the executive
branch being content to operate under the provisions of
the” Immunities Act. Id., at 2.

the police or other authorities that might have allowed the tragedy to happen.
The commission interviewed dozens of witnesses, Israeli and Palestinian, in 31
separate sessions. I knew early on that the inquiry would throw up difficult
issues. I was especially upset to learn that two soldiers and three border guards
scheduled for guard duty at the mosque had shown up late on the morning of the
killings. By the time I testified in late March, the inquiry had heard from a range
of senior and local commanders and individual soldiers. A picture had emerged
of a series of security breakdowns, equipment malfunctions, oversights and
confusion around the site where the murders took place.

I did not try to dodge the fact that security lapses around the Cave of the
Patriarchs that day had contributed to what happened. In addition to the fact that
the guard unit was not at full strength until after the murders took place, several
of the security cameras weren’t working. I acknowledged that if the cameras
and the guards had done their job, at the very least some lives might be have
saved. Yet I also made the point that this specific act of mass murder was
something the army could not have anticipated. I told the commissioners to
remember that they were judging things after the fact. They knew how the
tragedy had ended. In the context in which we were operating, the prospect of
an Israeli settler, a reserve soldier, walking into a place of worship and
deliberately killing defenseless Palestinians had come as “a bolt from the blue.”

The commission’s report did not apportion blame to any of the army officers
or commanders. But an inescapable conclusion from the testimony of the many
witnesses was that the way in which we’d become conditioned to viewing the
settlers had blinded us to the kind of crime Goldstein had committed. Even
before I testified, I'd been disturbed to hear soldiers saying that even if they had
seen him shooting a Palestinian, their orders were not to open fire on a settler,
so they wouldn’t have intervened. When asked about this by the commission, I
said it was a fundamental misunderstanding of our rules of engagement. “In no
case is there, nor can there be, an army order that says it is forbidden to shoot at
a settler even if he is shooting at others... A massacre is a massacre. You don’t
need special orders to know what to do.”

Yet I also knew that the soldiers’ “misunderstanding” was all too
understandable. As I acknowledged to the inquiry, the army on the West Bank
and Gaza was predisposed to see Palestinians who were carrying weapons as
potential terrorists, especially since the outbreak of the intifada. The settlers, by
contrast, were assumed to be carrying arms in self-defense. One lesson I took

Buying Into Palestinian Statehood

Yossi Alpher, Colette Avital, Shlomo Gazit, and Mark Heller

June 24, 201 1— Instead of wasting time and energy trying to revive a
moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the United States and
European Union should take another look at the Palestinian initiative
to seek U.N. recognition in September. What is described in some
quarters as a recipe for new strife and confrontation can actually be
leveraged into a win-win situation for Israelis, Palestinians and the
world.

The Palestinians under Mahmoud Abbas want the United Nations to
grant them a sovereign state based on the 1967 boundaries with East
Jerusalem as its capital. That’s all. It is not asking the U.N. to solve
the refugee /right-of-return issue or to determine who owns the
Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is opting to convert an intractable
conflict between a state and a liberation movement into a state-to-
state conflict with manageable parameters.

Why not offer the Palestinians what they want, but add elements that
could render the resolution acceptable to a majority of Israelis?
Israel wants acceptance as a Jewish state with its recognized capital in
Jerusalem. It needs assurances regarding the nature and priorities of
future negotiations, with the truly intractable issues postponed to a
later phase. It needs solid security arrangements, understandings
regarding Hamas rule in Gaza, and a viable incentive from an Arab
world that has long offered to reward it for moving forward with the
Palestinians.

Here are the components of a possible “win-win” U.N. resolution
regarding Palestinian statehood:

review (as the military calls the analysis process that takes place after
a plan has been implemented).

Teaching planning means teaching about goals, how they typi-
cally are achieved, what obstacles might be encountered, and how to
deal with them. The principles of planning are the same no matter
what domain you are in, so children can learn to plan birthday par-
ties, hikes, class trips, how to deal with their problems, how to treat
their little sister, how to get along with their parents, and so on. This
process can be learned by copying, seeing how others deal with these
things, adapting a plan that has worked before, and so on. A teacher
who tries to teach planning from first principles is teaching something
that is easily forgotten as well as teaching a process that doesn’t occur
that much in real life. Chefs adapt old recipes or parts of old recipes.
Generals adapt old battle plans or parts of old battle plans. Computer
programmers use code that has worked before. Planning without a pri-
or plan in mind really is quite unusual and generally not a good idea.

Planning, like diagnosis, should be a basic part of all curricula in
school at all ages. People make plans all the time. They plan their
lunch, they plan their day, they plan their trips, they plan their er-
rands, and, of course, they plan their lives. It is astonishing that we
don’t teach planning all the time in every aspect of life. But we don’t
because this doesn’t seem very academic. Since it is not explicitly
taught to children, it is reasonable to ask how we might best teach
planning to adults. Corporations want to teach financial planning,
resource planning, supply chain planning, creating business plans,
creating marketing plans, and so on. Planning is, in fact, one of the
major preoccupations of business, as well it should be. So, how do we
teach it?

The problem here is that planning really works in only one way.
It is relies on a case base. We plan by adapting old plans. That’s how
we do it. We store old plans and we retrieve them when we need them
again; we change them so they apply to the new situation or change
them so that this time they will work out when they failed before. But
we always Start with an old plan. New planners, those we are trying to
teach how to plan, cannot help but do this, even if they do not have
a relevant old plan to work from. They simply will choose the best
plan they have, even though it might not be all that germane to the
current situation. Proverbs—for example, to a man with a hammer,
everything is a nail—don’t come from nowhere.

Hebraicized it: to Barak, which seemed near enough to the original. Among the
few dozen outside the unit who did know about my role, however, were
paratroopers who’d joined us on various missions. One of them now told the El
Al people who I was. Not only was I given a seat on the first overnight plane
back to Tel Aviv. I found myself helping the airline establish a priority for
assigning seats to others: first, active officers in fighting units: armor, infantry,
the air force. Then, reservists, with the emphasis on those who’d seen active
service most recently.

As we were waiting to board, I phoned Uzi Dayan and asked him to meet me
at Lod the next morning. Then I called Motta again. “Ehud,” he said, with no
trace of irony, “it is an extremely serious war. Syrian tanks are getting close to
the outer fences of Nafakh” — our main command post on the Golan. “Good
luck.”

Uzi was waiting for me when we landed. Walking to his car, we ran into two
reserve armored officers who had also just arrived home. They expected to be
sent north, to help beat back the Syrian advance. When they asked me where I
thought I’d be going, I said, truthfully, I had no idea. “Wherever I can help,” I
said. Uzi drove us to the bor, the bunker built two floors underground in the
kirya. Usually, it functioned as the day-to-day operations center. But it was
where the commanders of the armed forces operated during times of war.

At officers’ school, we’d heard and read about the importance of throwing
the enemy “off balance”. Now, we were the ones off balance. The faces I saw
around me were gray and drawn. There were dead looks in the eyes of the
commanders and their staff. Some 30 hours after the surprise attack, all the self-
confidence we’d felt since 1967 seemed to have evaporated. I looked into
several of the rooms where, months earlier, I’d run through operational plans as
sayeret commander. Inside each, a large wall map traced the course of the
fighting. Israeli forces were marked in blue, the Syrians and Egyptians in red,
with a timestamp for each position report scribbled at the side in black magic
marker. But I saw that the latest addition was from at least twelve hours earlier.
It was as if we'd lost track of what was happening, or were simply
overwhelmed by the pace of events.

I spoke briefly with Talik as he walked along the corridor. He looked 10
years older than when I’d last seen him. Then I spotted Ahrahle Yariv, who had
been called back into military intelligence at the start of the war. Looking
surprised to see me back in Israel, he pulled me close to him. “It’s important

A nurse called. And she couldn’t get a

not the first, news sources to talk about
Enovid [the first birth control pill].

PK: In the first few issues! And the pill
was just a rumor. This guy, a journalist
-- | didn’t pay him much — he did a two-
part article, I think I paid him $100 for
each. He went to Puerto Rico, where they
were testing women. I had mixed feelings
about this, because they were testing
them like guinea pigs. But it worked, and
it became known as “the Pill.”

EP: Since we’re referring to a lot of
issues of The Realist, we should prob-
ably mention the online archive. I recall,
with some humor and business sense, you
only asked one thing: That we edit the
image to the Disneyland Orgy to include
a link to your site, saying a poster was
available for sale on your website.

PK: Oh yeah, that was a pure ad.

1“An Impolite Interview With An Abortionist,”
The Realist #35, June 1962.

EP: The first ad to run in The Realist,
probably?

PE: Well, sure. (laughs) It was letting
people know the poster existed.

EP: In the ten years that the archive’s been
up, it’s enjoyed a lot of regular traffic and
is now referenced in many dissertations.
By the way, did you see the Washington
Post article linking to the archive, specifi-
cally the LBJ story?”

PK: Oh, yeah. I heard about that from
Harry Shearer. He sent me the link to
the article, where they refer to me as
an “obscure 1960s figure.” The subject
line of Harry’s email was “It’s official!”
and then in the message, a link to the
article and the words “youre obscure!”
I laughed hysterically.

I think the LBJ piece (“The Parts Left
Out of the Kennedy Book,” The Realist
#74, May 1967) is still the most notorious
article; people remember it. Lewis Black
said he was fifteen when he read it and
said he was shocked! You know, because
the article was written as a seduction, in
a way. To the culmination, to the... what
do they call it in sex? The climax!

And then I published the anagram for
Nixon’s veep’s name, Spiro Agnew.

EP: “Grow a penis.” Do you remember

Subject: Trump & Patricia Kluge 
Importance: High 
Trump in talks to buy socialite Kluge's Charlottesville vineyard 
and estate 
By Annie Gowen and Steve Yanda 
Washington Post Staff Writers 
Wednesday, February 16, 2011; 10:47 PM 
Embattled Virginia socialite and winemaker Patricia Kluge may have found a white knight to preserve her Charlottesville 
empire - real estate mogul Donald Trump. 
Trump's business adviser said Wednesday that Trump was negotiating to buy not only Kluge's grand estate, Albemarle 
House, which a bank foreclosed on in January, but all of Kluge's former real estate holdings outside Charlottesville near 
Thomas Jefferson's Monticello estate. 
Those include 200 acres of land adjacent to the estate that once had a nine-hole golf course designed by Arnold Palmer, 
a 900-acre vineyard and a failed real estate development where Kluge had planned to market luxury farmettes with their 
own grapevines. 
Leslie Goldman, a Washington-based adviser to Trump, said it would be premature to speculate what Trump had 
planned for the area, but said the land has significant historical value and potential for development. 
Obviously, the more acreage, the more pieces you acquire, the more possibilities there are, he said. 
Trump has already made forays into Virginia real estate. In 2009, he purchased a 600-acre golf club along the Potomac 
River in Loudoun County and renamed it the Trump National Golf Club. He raised the ire of local environmentalists last 
summer after the club removed hundreds of trees that it claimed threatened the shoreline. 
Trump's representative appeared at a foreclosure auction of Kluge's large estate on the courthouse steps in downtown 
Charlottesville Wednesday morning, where a crowd of about 50 lawyers and curiosity seekers had gathered. 
In the past year, Kluge's travails have become well-known around Charlottesville, where over the last two decades the 
British-born socialite has cut a glamorous - and sometimes controversial - figure. 
In 1999 she founded what became a well-respected vineyard on land around her grand house, which she had received as 
part of a high-profile divorce settlement in 1990 from John Kluge, the late media mogul who was once the country's richest 
man. 
Kluge Estate Winery and Vineyard won accolades for sparkling wines - served at the White House and at Chelsea 
Clinton's wedding last summer - and a blended red called New World Red. Kluge and her third husband, retired IBM 
executive William Moses, worked to promote not only their own wine brand but the growing Virginia wine industry as a 
whole. 
But in the past two years, following some aggressive expansion of the winery and the failure of the housing development, 
Kluge fell upon hard times. Credit problems forced her to sell off her jewelry and extensive collection of art and antiques 
last year. She lost the vineyard at a foreclosure auction in December. 
Kluge had initially tried to sell Albemarle House - which the Sotheby's listing calls one of the most important residences in 
the United States since the Golden Age - for $100 million, but when no buyer came forward the price was ultimately 
slashed to $24 million. The eight-bedroom home has its own movie theater, wine grotto, swimming pool and helipad. 
At Wednesday's auction, Bank of America, Kluge's creditor, took full ownership of the property with a bid of $15.26 million. 
But Trump holds what the lawyers called a right of first refusal to buy the property at a later date. 
Kluge and Moses declined to comment directly on yesterday's events, but both have said they have been working 
diligently with their lawyers over the last several months to help save their business. 
The Trump organization had been working closely with Kluge and Moses on the deal, but how the partnership will play out 
- if they would have a future role at what would be Trump's vineyard - remained unclear Wednesday. 
They've been working together with the objective of trying to preserve the vineyard for the benefit of the Virginia wine 
industry, Goldman said. If it all comes together, it may provide them an opportunity to continue to stay involved in their 
life's work. 
Yanda reported from Charlottesville. Staff researcher Magda Jean-Louis also contributed to this report.

THE 
CONTROL 
FACTOR 
iur Sirussle to see. the True 'Threat 
FrontPage Interview's guest today is Bill Siegel, a lawyer and 
business executive. He has been a producer of several documentary films and assists numerous non-profit 
organizations. He is the author of The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True Threat. 
FP: Bill Siegel, welcome to FrontPage Interview. 
Congratulations on this brilliant book. It is without question one of the most vital works of our time. 
Let's begin with what inspired you to write it. 
Siegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with footage 
of Hitler and the Third Reich and could never understand how the Jews of the time could not see the evil 
that seemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could not comprehend the 
blindness. Following 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its history, its current movements, 
terrorism and so on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends 
and associates. Rather than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another 
to avoid the frightening truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I 
began to catalog many of my friends' different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult 
to endure. The more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a 
structure to the mental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain. 
FP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep 
us blind and that process of a voiding seeing the threats we face. It's also about, as you state, trying to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025029 
believe that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound 
insights you make in terms of the Control Factor. 
Siegel: First, let's distinguish the real world where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield 
which occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what 
is out there and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our 
internal minds become anxious and sense a loss of control, they tend to concoct ways to distort our 
perceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an active and 
continuous process designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our 
thinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening 
prospects, the mind is geared to actively distort. 
Similarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. 
In turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and 
thus seemingly all the more real. In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy 
McCarthy entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer 
than we are aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they 
must out maneuver our conscious thinking. 
Since World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of 
America's history has been about over there, where we have always known that if things got too out of 
hand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, 
have had virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is 
interesting on this point). 
Consequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a 
film, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience 
know there is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate 
Cincinnati etc. This threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. 
Much of the initial exposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat 
brings about, then explain it in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely 
terrifying is happening. The next stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr 
om trying to negotiate with it, to appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. 
Most of these failings are due to not adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting 
onto it a host of other attributes instead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall 
decision by whichever characters remain alive. I named this the turnaround moment when the character 
becomes willing to be as ruthless as the threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival. 
Ultimately, the storyline is a race for whichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever 
advantages they may still have to beat the threat. 
This is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to 
deny that which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up 
while we still have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in. 
I said ear her that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid 
where on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of 
maneuvers the many D's as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial, 
demonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. 
Layered upon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish 
to see in them or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These 
maneuvers involve a mixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the 
enemy is. Projection and introjection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to 
ask how what the enemy accuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt 
and Shame, our need to be liked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger 
fantasies. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025030 
As these narratives (Our courts will never allow that, As a superpower we will always be able to win any 
fight we put our minds to, Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized ...) gain consent from 
others they tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a 
relationship we take with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler. 
Emblematic of this relationship is the transfer of responsibility in which we assume responsibility for the 
enemy's behavior who is addicted to transferring it away from itself The Control Factor actively maintains 
this relationship and makes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his 
addiction. And just as an addict needs to devote serious effort and con sciousness to his addiction, so must 
we devote great energy to unders tanding how the Control Factor ultimately sabotages us. 
FP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk about the three levels of jihad against 
us. What are they? 
Siegel: Simply stated, our Islamic Enemy seeks the totalitarian domination of Islam throughout the world — 
Islamic supremacy. It seeks to have the West submit to Islam. Obviously, this does not mean that everybody 
becomes a Muslim. Islam, in all its varied expressions, permits dhimmis- those Christians, Jews, and some 
others who are permitted to remain as protected non-Muslims as long as they submit to an inferior status. 
What is critical is that Shariah (Islamic Law) ultimately rules the world. 
Jihad, loosely, is the effort/struggle to see this vision through. The most obvious method of Jihad is through 
violence; it is the one most familiar to most Westerners and almost all of the Koranic references to Jihad are 
based in violence. The Violent Jihad includes al-Qaeda and its offshoots as well as other groups that 
formed around the globe independent of al-Qaeda. It also obviously includes the violence from Islamic 
nations such as the Islamic Republic of Iran whose constitution specifies such vision. It also includes, 
however, various militant groups and training camps here in the US as well as ad hoc efforts of individuals. 
Since 9/11, there have been something in excess of 15,000 Violent Jihadic attacks across the globe. 
However, as terrible as this is, we have a tendency in the West to think that the only dimension of threat we 
face comes from violence. While the Bush administration helped initiate this thinking, the Obama 
administration has actively abused it by limiting any discussion of the threat we face to al-Qaeda and some 
other terrorist groups abroad. As frightening as these groups are, we can get some ease from thinking they 
are a band of extremists limited in number, weaponry, sophisticati on, and means. Stunningly, Hillary 
Clinton recently estimated that there are only about 50,000 homicidal violent extremists around the world 
who simply have been able to project power much greater than their number should allow. Here the Control 
Factor makes the threat appear more easily manageable. 
Jihad, however, is pursued in other often even more effective ways which I have grouped into three 
levels. A second more insidious level of threat is what the Muslim Brotherhood itself called the 
Civilization Jihad. It is the effort to infiltrate all aspects of our society, peacefully according to our laws, 
in order to later be in position to sabotage and destroy it from the inside. The Civilization Jihadists have 
learned the culture and rules of the territories they seek to command and use those rules to maneuver—
specifically using our freedoms to destroy our freedoms. They use lawfare to seek changes in our laws so 
as to push Shariah into our society. Your readers should read Daniel Pipes and Brooke Goldstein's Lawfare 
Project material and others to fully appreciate how cancerous this activity has become. This includes 
intimidating in a variety of ways anyone who speaks out against them or Islam and seeking to squelch our 
treasured broad right to free speech so as to ultimately prevent any criticisms of Islam. Once criticism of 
Islam is prohibited, little can stop it from cascading throughout the culture. 
The Civilization Jihad includes situating such Jihadists in critical positions in the society, in the 
government, in the legal system, the military, and elsewhere. It includes the control over university 
programs that distribute propaganda about Islam and Islamic history which then filters down throughout 
textbooks for even younger students. It includes control over most of the nation's mosques and local Imams 
guiding the mess ages engaged Muslims are receiving. Most troublesome are the Muslim g roups (CAIR, 
ISNA, MSA and others associated and/or joint venture partners with the Muslim Brotherhood) supposedly 
interested in outreach which know how to appear Westernized and interested in the goals of Western 
Civilization. They have fooled a large part of our authorities and media due in part to their patience and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025031 
willingness to chip away, one airport prayer room, one frivolous intimidating lawsuit, one Congressman or 
CIA officer, one mosque, one ruling at a time. 
Particularly in the US, given our deep attachment to freedom as well as cultural and psychological 
tendencies toward diversity, Western guilt and expectations of truthfulness, this effort is devious and 
difficult to uproot. The Civilization Jihadists present one face to the American public which is completely at 
odds with their true agenda and how they deal in private. Jamie, you and David and others such as Steve 
Emerson, Frank Gaffney, Andy McCarthy and others have done s o much to uncover this level of Jihad that 
your readers should be urged to review as much of their work (including Steve's recent excellent 
documentary, The Grand Deception,  and Frank's important web video course, The Muslim Brotherhood in  
America) as possible. 
Finally, there is a third level — the International Institutional Jihad. Here the most powerful international 
institutions such as the UN and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others seek to push into 
America from without those changes which are difficult to complete from within. The OIC is the largest 
Islamic institution in the world. It essentially controls the vote in the UN's General Assembly and thus 
explains in part the absurd and abject pro-Islamic, anti-Israel thrust of that organizat ion. This level seeks to 
use the power of Islamic nations to work fro m outside the West to force changes within the West. While 
there are various conflicts between many of the nations, being Islamic majority states, there is a great deal 
they agree upon which becomes the focus of these efforts. Just as the Obama administration is beginning to 
cooperate with international efforts to control gun ownership, so has Hillary Clinton's Istanbul Process 
become a dangerous step in the effort to restrict speech critical of Islam by norm (or possibly even treaty) 
when it may not be fully executable by domestic action alone. 
I should point out that Stephen Coughlin, the former Pentagon officer who has an important must-see 
presentation of Islamic Law, uses different names for these same three levels — Jihad, Dawa, and Ummah. 
Had I seen his work before I wrote my book I would have conformed to his categorizations. 
We must learn how powerful language has become on all three levels. Words such as peace,. $B!1 
freedom, terrorism, and phrases such as human rights have different meanings for us and for our 
Islamic Enemy. To oversimplify, peace is not something for now but that which comes when all the earth 
is submitting to Islam. In the context of battles, peace is at best a temporary ceasefire. Freedom is best 
understood as having the freedom to fully submit to Islam, not to choose whatever beliefs one desires while 
respecting the same right in others. We've all seen how human rights and terror really only apply 
among Muslims, not to non-Muslims. Our enemy fully understands these differences and uses them at all 
levels to paralyze us. 
Look simply at how the phrase Israeli-Palestinian conflict has equalized the two parties, making it all the 
easier to ascribe features of one to the other and view the problem as a simple-to fix division of ass ets into 
statehoods but for personality problems among the leaders. The simple truth is that this is and has always 
been a one-sided Arab war against Israel as Ruth Wisse and others have described and, as Bibi Netanyahu 
made clear, the ONLY state truly at issue here has been the State of Israel that the Arabs have refused for 
over half a century. Nonetheless, the Control Factor hypnotically abuses the mind's susceptibility to the 
intricacies of language. 
Even the label Peace Process has been damaging language. While most focus upon the first word, turning 
this into a process has helped ensure that peace is never obtained. It is more appropriately called the 
Extortion Process because all that results is that violence is used over decades to extract concessions from 
Israel. 
These three levels must be understood for their differences while united by a single goal. While these levels 
often op erate together and assist each other, we must avoid level confusion which the Control Factor 
employs to curtail our fears. If the Obama narrative is swallowed- that the only threat is the Violent Jihad-
we will miss the other contamination fomenting within our borders. We must appreciate how these levels 
work together and even unite with other forces such as the global Leftist movement that you, Jamie, have 
described so forcefully in United in Hate. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025032 
FP: You write about how we like to talk of Good Muslims and how we are always on the eternal search 
for moderate Muslims (Khatami, Mousavi, Abbas, etc), while we stress how the extremists are the real 
problem and how few they really are. All of this is connected to the Control F actor. Enlighten us. 
Siegel: The Control Factor seeks to have us feel in control of the situation. The easiest way to do this is to 
simply minimize the number of potential enemies. We have been lectured for years about how Islam is a 
religion of peace and that the violence we see (remember that we have already improperly limited the 
problem to violence) is the product of a small number of crazies (remember Hillary Clinton's 50,000) 
who have distorted Islam. I call this the Peaceful Muslim Disclaimer as virtually everyone in the press 
and government has been bullied into making some statement of the kind to silence those who will pressure 
them that they are Islamophobic and Islam is being attacked. (These are the Islam hustlers who operate on 
the same principles that black race hustlers so effectively used to extort concessions over the last six 
decades or so). 
Nobody has done any real work to support this proposition, nor is it clear exactly how it would be tested. 
My view is that the grammar Islam is x is itself problematic because Islam has expressed itself throughout 
history in a variety of fashions. It is more useful to talk in terms of how seriously engaged with Islam, the 
Koran and other texts, a Muslim is. What is significant is how Muslims today are using Islam and most of 
those who are in power either throughout a large territory or within a small community tend toward, if not 
fully advocate, the very supremacist ideas that we try to tell ourselves are reserved for the 
few extremists. Presumably most Germans did not wish to see all Nazi atrocities carried out but in the 
end they fell in line because they had to. Those our politicians and press call the extremists are in one 
sense more accurately the good Muslims who ar e following their Islamic beliefs dutifully. 
FP: Tell us how Western shame and guilt play into all of this. 
Siegel: One of the dirty little secrets the Control Factor preys upon is that if we believe we control 
something we can comfort ourselves that we can change it. Remember the horror film- the threat has one 
purpose and that is to destroy you. You can not change it, talk it out of it, teach it alternatives or otherwise. 
That is what makes it so inherently frightening. If we can convince ourselves that we caused the threat to act 
the way it does we can maintain the secret hope that we can change it. Consequently, there is a tremendous 
attraction to blaming ourselves for the Islamic Enemy's behavior. And we see this power in our readily 
accepting responsibility for terror- because of our occupation, our greedy quest for oil, our failure to extend 
a hand of engagement, Israel's building settlements, our making videos that defa me Mohammed and so 
on. Again, the relationship is defined by the enemy blaming us for his actions and our accepting such 
responsibility. 
Shelby Steele has written brilliantly about what he calls white guilt and outlines how whites during the 
60's and thereafter were pressured into a transaction whereby in order to re-obtain a sense of moral authority 
they accepted blame for the condition of blacks and behaved as if guilty. Blacks were able to extract great 
concessions and whites were able to view themselves as morally restored and redeemed. At a certain point, 
however, the behavior takes on a life of its own and the narratives become deeply embedded in the culture 
and, as we can see today, difficult to uproot. 
Western guilt is an extension of Steele's notion. President Obama's confessionals to the Arab world 
admitting that America has made mistakes and was not born a colonial pow er express this same tendency 
to appease through guilt. Hillary Clint on's reset with Russia conveyed the same submissive request for a 
more acceptable response. In being guilty we presume the other party will recognize our contrition and 
respond in like kind. One of the Control Factor's most devastating moves is employed- presuming the other 
is just like us and will respond the way we would. This is frequently how an enabler justifies his continuous 
support for an addict. The problem, however is that our Islamic Enemy is NOT like us and will not respond 
in like kind. Rather, as we repeatedly refuse to learn, appeasement invites more abuse from an 
enemy. This becomes the game of guilt; it tends to expand to greater and greater consequences. 
Paradoxically, psychological defenses tend to create the very outcomes they seek to eliminate and it is no 
different here. It is a game we love to play but, unfortunately, the game gives us no rules for how to end it. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025033 
All beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along with other 
Control Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing. 
FP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely because of 
our Control Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers. 
Siegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see what he was 
about, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that 
could allow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was blatantly voicing his Islamist 
views and Jihadi intent including, even, an essay recommending the painful liquidation of non-Muslims. 
Yet, in the Army of all places, the Control Factor operated to allow and even foster his work. Even after the 
murders, we cont inue the denial by calling it workplace violence. He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad 
combo! And we continue to enable the same infiltration elsewhere. 
FP: Tell our readers about The Project and Explanatory Memorandum. These are realities that serve as 
great threats to the Control Factor, right? 
Siegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood's goals and 
plans underlying the Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. The 
1991 Explanatory Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation trial and describes the 
Brotherhood's work in America as a Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means and a kind of 
grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and 'sabotaging' its 
miserable house by their own hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God's religion 
is made victorious over all other religions. 
Much as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term plan to 
destroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying the 
nuclear family, secularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategies to 
infiltrate while eroding the foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into an Islamic one. The 
Control Factor has many ingenious ways to convince us that this is ridiculous, that our courts and system 
would never allow such a thing, that one is racist or Islamophobic, if not insane, for even thinking this is 
real. And just as with the communists, time is plentiful. Even more so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-
decade plan is short term. It is not critical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to see the result. It is 
critical, more correctly a duty, however, that he carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for 
Security Policy's Team B Report, Shariah: The Threat to America, are excellent sources for your readers to 
pursue these documents. 
FP: And so what you call an Inner Jihad has to start. It's our, as you say, mandatory addiction 
treatment. Please explain. 
Siegel: The Inner Jihad is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control Factors. There is 
a famous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, essentially says that the physical 
fight was the lesser Jihad and it is time to then attend to the greater Jihad 4- that internal battle against 
our own internal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to 
say that Jihad is not violent, it is useful to us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally 
against our own Control Factor tendencies. 
As I said earlier, the Control Factor is active and continuous so we must constantly monitor and combat 
it. Like Whack-a-Mole, just as we may think we have addressed it, another variation pops right up. I use 
the terms addict and enabler because we truly need a form of rehab to break the habitual power of the 
Control Factor and because our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a 
typical addict and his enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler 
act essentially addicted to his behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship 
involves the transfer of responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant actions onto us with our 
response framed essentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy's grievance. (Your 
book, United in Hate, describes this addiction to hate in detail. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025034 
The key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant 
actions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can about the 
enemy. We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are 
not. We must speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are 
consistent with our principles. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its 
intrusion. This is an individual endeavor as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book 
gives plenty of examples of each maneuver discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the 
unique workings of his own mind. That takes the work of the Inner Jihad. 
FP: Share with our readers what you mean by the Turnaround Moment. 
Siegel: There is a moment in typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed to their 
limit. They then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthless as the threat they face. No more 
moral high ground; no more futile attempts to ignore or change the threat's essence. As Lee Harris 
described in The Suicide of Reason, it is the willingness o r license to be (not necessarily actually being) as 
ruthless that is critical. It is a mental state that sheds all the prior counter-productive efforts at denial to 
finally clearly focus on the threat faced. Part of the Inner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner 
rather than later. 
FP: You suggest that mirroring should be used as part of our arsenal. Tell us about it. 
Siegel: Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict responsibility that we have been 
inappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict/enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like the addict, the 
enemy uses a less limiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates aggression while we 
respond only. Mirroring means that we demonstrate our willingness to act symmetrically, to be governed by 
the same rules. It is stunning how much is accomplished when one's attitude simply is clear that he will do 
what is necessary; often not much else is needed as the addict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally 
changed. But other times action is absolutely needed. Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat the 
enemy as it treats us carries great meaning. Imagine (international law aside) if Israel announced that from 
now on it will mirror Hamas such that if civilian populations are targeted by bombs from Gaza, Israel will 
do the same (it is accused of such anyway). The population might finally rethink and take responsibility for 
its privilege of voting its leaders. As stated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we mirror we teach 
the other the effects of his behavior. 
Conversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases where it is necessary to 
highlight our differences with the enemy. Just this week, an disingenuous report was issued by an NGO 
drawing an equivalence between Palestinian and Israe li schoolbooks claiming that both sides have their 
relativistic  narratives. Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch's website has demonstrated for years, there is 
nothing in the West anywhere comparable to the hatred spewed daily by the Palestinian Authority, 
including through its education system. It is interesting to note that while the US State Department initially 
funded the study,- in what appears to be an attempt to sanitize the PA's record so that the US can 
continue to fund the PA against the spirit of US law- Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escaping her 
conclusion as Senator in 2007 that these schoolbooks along with other media profoundly poison(s) the 
minds of these children. It is most important that we do not succumb to this type of use of symmetry that 
distorts the profound differences between us and the enemy. 
Essentially, we are not clear as a nation, participating in a world with international rules, how to bes t fight 
this enemy. The first act of any rehab is to acknowledge that we do not know how nor are we yet competent 
to stop our addictions. This is not a book about policy. In fact, the right policies are unlikely to emerge 
until a critical mass has meaningfully dealt with their Control Factors and share a common perspective. We 
like to look at our history and assume a single perspective throughout but the truth is that we had to learn 
how to respond to Pearl Harbor, the Nazis, the Cold War etc. The same applies here. Our press promotes 
elites who are tasked with acting as if they possess the true wisdom to deal with our threats but the truth 
is we do not know nor are we equipped to marshal enough of our population to agree just yet. The sooner 
we learn, however, the less we will suffer. Mirroring has always been a key component of those lessons. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025035 
I have been encouraged by some recent acts that have begu n to nip at the asymmetry. For years, the 
language of feeling s had been reserved for our enemy while we were limited to that of action; we 
would do terrible acts that would cause bad feelings in the enemy which would then serve to justify 
whatever response it made. It had always been a question of the harsh insensitive acts Westerners do against 
Muslims and the resulting hurt, loss, shame etc. that Muslims experience. The Ground Zero Mosque 
incident, however, broke new ground because all of a sudden non-Muslims' feelings became the focus and 
were cast as resulting from Muslim acts. Another example was seen in how quickly the attempt to blame the 
Benghazi murders on the video about Mohammad fell apart. Just as large corporations eventually learned to 
turn away from shakedown attempts from race baiters, we are beginning to learn to demand symmetry 
through mirroring. A word of caution: When enablers change their behavior and demand symmetrical rules 
for the addict, the latter typically initially erupts with great resistance. This is a stage we must be prepared 
to tolerate and fully withstand as it creates the only real chance for the addict to finally change. It is critical, 
therefore, that when we finally engage in mirroring that we be prepared to see it through completion. 
FP: What if we fail to engage in our own Inner Jihad and the Control Factor stays firmly in place? 
Siegel: Critical to the Inner Jihad is the realization that our civilization is fragile; not to be taken for granted. 
Our demands for multi-culturalism and diversity have bumped heads with the simple paradox that tolerating 
the intolerant leads to extinction. Tolerating the intolerant is perhaps the most crystalline version of 
asymmetry we have accepted. Seriously engaged Muslims MUST place the Koran above all law while in 
America, the Constitution ranks supreme. As Omar Ahmad, founder of CAIR, reputedly said, Islam isn't 
in Amer ica to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran is the highest authority in 
America and Islam is the only accepted religion on Earth. Who makes law- the people or Allah? While the 
Control Factor constantly seeks for some accommodation between the two, this conflict CAN NOT be 
negotiated. Only one can survive not because we have declared war but because our Islamic Enemy has. 
That is, perhaps, the lesson we will most need to fully learn, one way or another. We will eventually hit a 
Turnaround Moment as a nation and if enough of us are not truly prepared to fight and continue to be 
controlled by our delusions, we will lose. If we truly seek to win, it is better to get there sooner while we 
have advantages than later.

The war being waged has two components - mental and physical. The mental side is a minefield of 
constructs, deeply implanted within generations of Americans, and its PC chickens are coming home to 
roost. So much so, millions of Americans (westerners) cannot break free of its shackles. But it is not as if 
these mental chains magically appe ared. Far from it - http://adinakutnicki.com/2012/11/26/the-death-of-...  
In addition, the fault-lines of democracy allowed for the most retrograde forces, on this planet, to infiltrate 
and penetrate the body politic- http://adinakutnicki.com/2012/09/02/the-subversio...  
IF the mental and physical constraints are not immediately removed, it is a given that western civilization 
will fall. Cause and effect.

And I would think one phy sical constraint is to not let them in in the first place. By & quot;them I mean 
those who have allegiance to a socio-political system disguised as a religion that seeks world dominance by 
man imposed methodology/effort -- unlike Judaism and Christianity properly understood. If we are to

Notice how celebrities basking in their narcissism think they can dictate culture to us while they live their 
lives in the comfort of their ivory castles. Mia farrow has no clue what the right to bear arms means and 
because of that she needs to shut the hell up. As far as blacks go-- I grew up in the 70's coming home from 
Hallahan H.S. in Philadel phia, me and my small group of girls were swarmed by a mob of black girls who 
would kick and slap and pull hair without provocation, of course we would fight back but then that was 
back in the day when whites weren't sissies. Still I made excuses for them. Black men would get in my face 
for no other reason than to intimidate me. rocks were thrown a my car for no reason. So, in short, based on 
my experiences Blacks are the cause of racism and if they hate whites so much then they should stay away 
completely and totally.

I read the Control factor and it was excellent. I wish more people would realize that our country is at its 
most vulnerable than ever in its history. the jihadis have basically taken over the inner cities. Islam's love 
for violence coupled with ignorance and narcissim are a recipe for disaster. I hope Americans wake up in 
time to save their future. I'm not optimistic though. I think its over but still I fight on.

Great Pumpkin rises on Halloween if you like, but at some point you
might notice that this doesn’t seem to take place.

Beliefs, reality, and the rules of causation are interrelated but they
are not the same thing. Causal knowledge should, however, enable
one to alter erroneous beliefs that don’t stand up to what one knows
about causation.

So what would cause Jews to suddenly flock to Israel? Is she privy
to information about another Holocaust or is this some fundamental-
ist religious belief? She doesn’t say. The fact that she doesn’t say, is
what makes her look either unintelligent or incapable of clear reason-
ing. Being able to justify one’s beliefs by citing common knowledge
or revealing knowledge known only to you involves relying on com-
monly known rules about causation.

What about prediction?

You can believe that New York will beat Philadelphia in football.
You can predict it based on evidence. You can explain the cause and
effect that have made you come to this point of view. But, after New
York loses, you need to modify some beliefs that you previously held.
At the very least you have to acknowledge that your prediction was
wrong and you might want take this into account the next time you
make a prediction, by finding out what went wrong in your reasoning,
if anything. Or, you simply can say your team wasn’t lucky, of course.

Prediction relies on beliefs, and in many situations predictions are
or are not verified immediately and new thinking can begin. But when
one gets married, for example, one is predicting that the marriage will
be good and will work out well for all parties. One might not realize
for some years that this prediction was wrong. Then, when seeking
a new marriage, the predictor hopes she has determined what went
wrong by seeing what erroneous beliefs were held the last time.

It is very good to be able to predict, but predictive ability is not
seen as a Sign of intelligence. After all, people seek out fortune tellers
because they think fortune tellers have a gift, not because they think
fortune tellers are very bright. At the 2010 Olympics an octopus was
apparently capable of making accurate predictions. No one claimed
that it was an especially bright octopus.

A prediction made by someone that is justified by, “I just feel it,”
makes the predictor look foolish. In contrast, a prediction about rela-
tivity, for example, that is complex to understand but has been ex-
plained clearly and later is borne out by evidence makes the predictor

Cooperation occurs when we take on costs to help others.
A key
mechanism by which cooperation is sustained is reciprocity: individuals
cooperate with those who have cooperated in the past. In
reality, we not only condition on others’ past cooperative actions,
but also on the decision making process that leads to cooperation:
we trust more those who cooperate without calculating the costs
because they will cooperate even when those costs are high.
We
propose a game theory model to explain this phenomenon. In our
model, player 1 chooses whether or not to cooperate with player 2.
Player 1 faces a stochastic temptation to defect and, before choosing
whether to cooperate, also decides whether to “look” at the
realized temptation. Player 2 observes not only whether player 1
ultimately cooperated but also whether she looked, then decides
1
whether or not to continue interacting with player 1. We find conditions
in which there is an equilibrium where player 2 chooses to
interact with player 1 only if player 1 cooperates without looking
(CWOL) and player 1 chooses to CWOL. We show that this equilibrium
is robust to both high degrees of rationality, as modeled by
subgame perfection and learning or evolutionary dynamics, as modeled
by the replicator dynamic.
Using computer simulations, we
also show that it emerges with high frequency, even in the presence
of other equilibria. Additionally, we show that the ability for player
1 to avoid looking, and the ability for player 2 to detect looking
increases cooperation. We propose this model as a possible explanation
for a number of interesting phenomena, and thereby derive
novel predictions about these phenomena, including why we dislike
“flip-flopping” politicians and respect principled people more generally,
why people cooperate intuitively, and why people feel disgust
when considering taboo trade-offs, and why people fall in love.
Cooperation occurs when we take on costs to help others. A key mechanism by which
cooperation is sustained is reciprocity: individuals condition their behavior on others’
past actions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In reality, we not only condition
on others’ past actions, but also on the decision-making process that lead to cooperation:
we place more trust in cooperators who do not take time to carefully weigh the costs of
cooperation and who do not try to collect data on such costs before deciding whether to
cooperate. For example, we are impressed by colleagues who agree to proofread a paper
without thinking twice, and view with suspicion those who ask, “how long will it take?”
before agreeing to attend a practice talk. Such considerations are left out of standard
2
models of reciprocity, which only attend to cooperative actions and not the deliberation
process leading up to the action.
We develop a simple model to explain why “looking” at the costs of cooperation is
viewed with suspicion. The explanation we suggest is quite intuitive: those who cooperate
without looking (CWOL) can be trusted to cooperate even in times when there are
temptations to defect. While this insight can be captured without the need for a formal
model, it is less clear that cooperators will choose to not look, since they pay a price by
cooperating blindly in tempting circumstances. Moreover, the formal model, as will be
seen, helps explicate when CWOL will occur as well as what difference the ability to not
look and to observe others not looking will make.
We formalize this idea using what we call the envelope game (see figure 1).
The
envelope game distills an interaction between two individuals, or players, in an uncertain
environment.
Thus, we start by assuming there is a distribution of payoffs with two
possibilities: one in which defection is relatively tempting, and another in which it is
not. The temptation to defect is randomly determined. Defection is not tempting with
probability p and tempting with probability 1 − p. Both players know how likely it is that
defection is tempting. However, at this point, neither player knows size of the temptation.
That is, the temptation is placed inside an envelope and the envelope is sealed without
the players knowing its content. Next, we assume that one of the players, player 1,
chooses whether to learn the size of the temptation, either via mental deliberation or by
gathering information. We model this in a simplified way by assuming that player 1 has a
dichotomous choice: she can choose to open the envelope and look inside it, or not. If she
opens the envelope and looks, she learns the size of the temptation. If she does not open
the envelope and look, she only knows the distribution of payoffs. Player 1 then chooses
whether to cooperate or defect. We model cooperation as costly to player 1, regardless
3
of the temptation, but more costly if the temptation is high. Thus, if the temptation is
low, player 1 gets a > 0 if she cooperates and c l > a if she defects. If the temptation is
high, she gets a if she cooperates and c h > c l if she defects. We assume that cooperation
benefits the other player, which we refer to as player 2. We assume, for simplicity, that
player 2 gets b > 0 if 1 cooperates and d < 0 if 1 defects, and that these payoffs to player 2
are the same regardless of 1’s temptation. For now, we also assume that d < p/(1 − p) · b;
that is, defection is sufficiently harmful to player 2 that player 2 prefers to avoid the
interaction if player 1 only cooperates some of the time. Finally, we model player 2’s
trust in player 1. We model this by giving player 2 the choice of whether to continue
the interaction with player 1. If player 2 continues the interaction, then with probability
w, all previous steps are repeated, potentially indefinitely. That is, the temptation to
defect is randomly chosen again, player 1 chooses whether to look at it, and so on. With
probability 1 − w, the game ends. The parameter w can be interpreted as the likelihood
of a future interaction or the player’s discounting of future payoffs. Crucially, we assume
that player 2 observes both of player 1’s choices: not only whether 1 cooperated, but
also whether 1 first looked. Our model, therefore, applies to situations where player 1’s
looking is somewhat observable, for example, if player 1 can gain additional information
about the costs of defection by asking player 2 questions, or if player 1 can take time to
ponder the decision and player 2 can observe player 1’s reaction time. We assume that
players maximize their expected payoffs. Note that since we assumed a > 0 and b > 0,
both players benefit from a cooperative interaction.
In the envelope game, a strategy for player 1 dictates whether she will look and whether
she will cooperate, as a function of whether she has looked and cooperated in the past,
and as a function of the temptation if she has just looked. For example, one relatively
simple strategy for player 1 is to look and cooperate whenever the temptation is low.
4
Similarly, a strategy for player 2 dictates whether he will continue or exit as a function
of everything player 1 has done in the past. One relatively simple strategy for player 2
is to continue so long as player 1 has cooperated. If both players play according to this
pair of strategies, each time the temptation is low, player 1 cooperates and gets a, player
2 gets b, and the game continues with probability w until the first time the temptation
is high. Then, player 1 defects and gets c h and player 2 gets d. Some straightforward
calculations yield the players’ expected payoffs: player 1’s is [ap + c h (1 − p)] / [1 − pw]
and player 2’s is [bp + d(1 − p)] / [1 − pw]. Because a strategy specifies players’ moves in
every period and the game’s length is undetermined, infinitely many possible strategies
exist. We are primarily interested in the seven strategies represented in Figure 2, which
shows the expected payoff for each player for each strategy pair of interest.
Of particular interest is the strategy pair designated in the top left corner of figure 2),
in which player 2 discriminates between cooperators who look and those who do not
look, and player 1 cooperates without looking (CWOL). The following simple argument
demonstrates that this strategy pair is a Nash Equilibrium (which means no player has
an incentive to unilaterally deviate) whenever
a
≥ c 1−w lp + c h (1 − p). This condition has a
natural interpretation: player 1’s expected temptation from defection is less than the gains
from an ongoing cooperative interaction. Thus, player 1 would lose from deviating, for
example by looking, because this would end the lucrative ongoing relationship, reducing
player 1’s payoff from an expected
a
1−w
to 0. Player 2 would also lose from deviating, by
choosing to exit, because when player 1 is always cooperating, she expects
relationship, and exiting yields 0.
b
1−w
from the
One potential concern with this equilibrium is that, since player 2 is not worse off by
not attending to looking, he might not do so. This turns out to not be the case. The
intuition is that if there is even a small probability player 1 looks, player 2 is better off
5
attending to looking. In the appendix, we formalize this intuition by showing that this
equilibrium is subgame perfect, a solution concept used to rule out these kinds of concerns
in settings where there is a high degree of rationality [15].
We might wonder whether CWOL will emerge in a population of players who are not
rational, but are evolving or learning their strategies. There are two reasons to suspect
it will not emerge. First, CWOL may be susceptible to the invasion of mutants. In
particular, the concern is that a player 2 mutant might arise that does not attend to
whether player 1 looks, rendering looking irrelevant. This mutant’s fitness is no higher or
lower than the incumbent strategy, so may grow by drift. Subsequently, a player 1 mutant
which looks and defects when the temptation is high would have a fitness advantage and
proliferate. While the player 2 mutant would then start dying off since it would now have
lower fitness than the incumbent, it is not clear that it would do so fast enough for the
player 1 mutant to also die off, returning to the CWOL equilibrium. Second, CWOL may
be stable but have such a small basin of attraction that it will never emerge. In particular,
there are three other equilibria to consider, which can be seen in figure 2. The first is
comprised of the strategy pair where player 1 always defects, and player 2 always exits
(which we refer to as the ALLD equilibrium). It is a Nash Equilibrium for all parameter
values. The second is the strategy pair where player 2 exits if player 1 defects, and player
1 cooperates with or without looking (we refer to this as the CWL equilibrium). It is a
Nash equilibrium when
a ≥ c 1−w 2. In fact, there are many more Nash Equilibria, where
the population mixes between different strategies.
Consequently, we employ computer simulations of the replicator dynamic to explore
the evolutionary dynamics of the envelope game. The replicator dynamic is the standard
model for evolutionary dynamics [16, 17, 18, 19], and also models learning dynamics such
as reinforcement learning or prestige-biased imitation [20]. It describes strategies evolving
6
over time under the assumption that the rate of reproduction within each population
is proportional to the fitness relative to that type’s other strategies.
Since replicator
dynamics cannot be solved in closed form, they must analyzed using computer simulations
seeded with randomly chosen strategy frequencies. This method also requires restricting
the analysis to a few strategies. Therefore, we run our replicator analysis only on the
restricted set of strategies represented in figure 2. While this set of strategies is restricted,
it includes the potentially destabilizing mutants discussed above.
To investigate the frequencies in which different equilibria emerge, we randomly seed
the strategy frequencies many times and record the frequency of each strategy after the
population has stabilized. Many mixtures of strategies are behaviorally consistent with
CWOL, for example, if a large enough fraction of player 2s exit when player 1s look then
no player 1s will look, even if this fraction is less than 1. Thus, we classify population
frequencies as being behaviorally equivalent to ALLD, CWL, and CWOL (see appendix
for details). We plot the frequencies of each of these for different values of a in figure 3 (see
appendix for analogous figures for other parameters). As can be seen, CWOL emerges
often when it is a Nash Equilibrium.
Next, we identify the conditions under which people will be most likely to avoid looking
and detect looking amongst others. For this, we interpret the conditions under which
CWOL is the only cooperative equilibrium, because, as we show in the appendix, when one
allows for mutations, the CWOL equilibrium no longer emerges in dynamic simulations
when both CWOL and CWL are equilibria. Recall that CWL is a Nash equilibrium if
and only if
a
≥ c 1−w 2. This equilibrium condition has a natural interpretation: in order to
sustain CWL, the long term gains to player 1 from the ongoing relationship must suffice
for player 1 to cooperate even when player 1 knows the temptation is high in the current
period.
Contrast this with the condition that determines if CWOL is an equilibrium:
7
a
≥ c 1−w 1p + c 2 (1 − p). This equilibrium condition has a natural interpretation as well:
in order to sustain CWOL, the long term gains to player 1 from the ongoing relationship
must suffice for player 1 to cooperate when player 1 expects the temptation to sometimes
be high.
That is, not looking makes the expected–as opposed to realized–gains from
defection relevant, in a sense smoothing the temptation to defection. Thus, the range
where CWOL is an equilibrium and CWL is not, c 1 p + c 2 (1 − p) ≤
a
1−w
< c 2, has the
following interpretation: the expected temptation is low but the maximal temptation is
high. In the appendix, we confirm this result using our subgame perfections analysis. We
also use dynamics to show that, CWOL increases relative to CWL when we increase the
maximal temptation, but hold the mean temptation constant.
We identify a second condition under which people will be most likely to avoid and
detect looking by relaxing the assumption d >
p b. Then, in the region where d ≤
p
1−p
1−p b,
there is a fourth equilibrium. It is the strategy pair where player 2 always continues if
player 1 cooperates when the temptation is low, and player 1 looks and cooperates only
when the temptation is low (we refer to this as the ONLYL equilibrium). In contrast,
CWOL is an equilibrium for all values of d. CWOL is thus the only cooperative equilibrium
in the parameter region d >
p b, which has the interpretation: defection is sufficiently
1−p
harmful to player 2 such that player 2 prefers to avoid the interaction if player 1 only
cooperates some of the time.
Note that CWOL is an equilibrium over a wider parameter region than both CWL
and ONLYL, and thus that the ability to avoid looking and to detect whether others look
increases the parameter space over which cooperation is feasible. To see this, consider removing
player 1’s strategy which consists of not looking. Alternatively, consider removing
player 2’s strategy where he conditions his behavior on whether player 1 has looked. In
either case, cooperation is only sustained in a Nash Equilibrium if
a
≥ ap + c 1−w 2(1 − p) or
8
d >
p b. These are the same condition needed for CWL and ONLYL, respectively, and,
1−p
as discussed above, these ranges is strictly smaller than the range of values over which
CWOL is an equilibrium.
To summarize, CWOL can occur in equilibrium, and this equilibrium is subgame perfect,
is stable, and has a sizable basin of attraction in the replicator dynamics. Moreover,
we expect player 2 to prefer interacting with player 1s who do not look and player 1s to
actively avoid looking when defection is harmful and the temptation to defect is usually
small but sometimes huge. Finally, under these conditions, cooperation can be sustained
only if player 1 can avoid looking and player 2 can observe whether player 1 looks.
While we modeled player 1 looking at the temptation to defect, we could analogously
have modeled player 1 looking at the benefits to cooperating. This can be interpreted as
looking to see if anyone is watching, asking what one will get, or calculating the value of
the ongoing relationship. In this and some similar cases, the modifications to the model
would be straightforward and analysis would be equivalent.
We now apply the model to shed light on a number of interesting phenomena, including
why we dislike “flip-flopping” politicians and respect principled people more generally, why
people cooperate intuitively, why people feel disgust when considering taboo trade-offs,
and why people fall in love.
We trust candidates for political office whose policies are the result of their convictions
and are consistent over time, and distrust those whose policies are carefully constructed
in consultation with their pollsters and who “flip-flop” in response to public opinion, as
caricatured by the infamous 2004 Republican presidential campaign television ad showing
John Kerry wind-surfing, and tacking from one direction to another. At first glance, this
seems irrational: one would think it a virtue for a politician to flexibly respond to public
opinion once in office. This logic is illustrated by John Maynard Keynes’ famous quote:
9
“When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” However, if policies
based on conviction or consistency over time are signals that a candidate does not look
at the benefits of cooperation, this is an indication that the candidate can be trusted in
situations where making the decision that is right for his or her constituency comes at
a large political cost. Consistent with this, opponents take every opportunity to paint
candidates as flip-floppers who cannot be trusted [21]. This argument generalizes outside
of politics to why we respect people who are “principled” over those who are “strategic”.
People intuitively cooperate. That is, when people make decisions rapidly, they are
more likely to cooperate than if they have time to deliberate. Additionally, people who
cooperate make quicker decisions than those who defect [22]. The Social Heuristics Hypothesis
offers one explanation for this phenomena: we adopt heuristics to avoid incurring
cognitive costs associated with deliberation [23, 24, 25]. In a world with repeated interactions,
it is usually worthwhile to cooperate, so individuals may adopt heuristics such
as “always cooperate” or “cooperate as long a situation is not a business interaction.”
These same individuals, when serving as laboratory subjects, may apply these heuristics
and cooperate even when it is not worthwhile to do so [22, 26].
Our model offers the following alternative explanation for intuitive cooperation. Intuitive
cooperation may serve to reduce responsiveness to realized costs. Thus, others should
trust intuitive cooperators more than deliberate cooperators. Since intuitive cooperators
are more trustworthy, this may lead people to evolve or learn to become intuitive cooperators.
Note that this explanation suggests that intuitive cooperation may be an optimal
response to others’ ability to detect deliberation, and not, as a heuristic is, an attempt
to avoid cognitive costs. For this explanation to be sensible, it must be the case that
whether or not a decision is made intuitively or deliberatively is detectable. In fact, it is:
deliberative decision making leads to slower reaction time, as well as increased pupil size
10
and heart rate [27], and sometimes blushing or stammering [28]. In contrast to the Social
Heuristics Hypothesis, our model also predicts that decisions related to cooperation are
more likely to be intuitive than other decisions that are similarly usually worthwhile, and
that intuitive cooperators are trusted more than reflective cooperators. To our knowledge,
neither of these predictions has been tested yet.
People dislike considering trade-offs related to “sacred values” [29].
Sacred values
are values such as love, liberty, honor, justice, or life, that people treat “as possessing
transcendental significance that precludes comparisons, trade-offs, or indeed any mingling
with secular values” [29].
While there is variation in what societies consider sacred,
virtually all societies have a concept of sacredness [29].
Sacred values are so strongly
imbued in us that we do not find them puzzling prima fascia, yet their existence and
origin remains poorly understood. What makes us treat some values as sacred and what
differentiates these values from secular values like free time or money that we more readily
trade off?
Our model provides one possible explanation. People who calculate costs of trading
off against sacred values are less trustworthy when it comes to safeguarding these values
than people who consider them sacred and would never calculate the costs of trading
off against them. Responding with disgust to these “taboo trade-offs” may be one way
to prevent us from interacting with people who make such trade offs and hence are less
trustworthy, and may also be a way to signal to others that we ourselves would not
consider, and therefore make, such trade-offs.
Consistent with CWOL, it is taboo to
consider the trade-off even if one ultimately makes the right choice, and the longer the
trade-off is considered for, the harsher the judgement by observers [29]. As with intuitive
cooperation, if people who refuse to consider taboo trade-offs are seen as more trustworthy,
this may lead people to evolve or learn to abide by these taboos. If CWOL indeed underlies
11
the phenomena of taboo trade-offs, then it provides a novel prediction: taboo trade-offs
will prevail precisely in situations where there is large but infrequent temptation to defect
and defection is harmful, such as selling a child, betraying a country, or sleeping with
someone for a million dollars. It remains to be shown that taboo trade-offs demonstrate
this characteristic. It also provides an important policy prescription regarding policies
forbidding taboo trade-offs, for example, the ban on euthanasia: such policies are socially
suboptimal, since the benefits of cooperating without looking accrue to the individuals
who advocate them, but the costs are borne by society.
Finally, our model offers an explanation for emotions such as love, and can thus be
thought of as a formalization of Frank (1988). Love has the property that we behave
altruistically towards our partners regardless of what temptations arise [30], as illustrated
by the wedding vow, “for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in
health.” For example, love causes individuals to ignore other potential mates, even if those
mates are better than one’s current mate, as Shakespeare’s Juliet did when her love for
Romeo led her to rebuff the advances of the otherwise-more-suitable Paris.
Why does love have this property? Our model suggests that those in love will more
often be chosen as long-term partners. If this argument in fact underlies love, then it
is crucial that love is observable, and that it necessarily cannot be displayed while still
attending to costs. There is evidence consistent with this: related emotions are observable
[31], cannot be faked [32], and are relied upon by partners when choosing whether to
cooperate [33]. There is also reason to believe love and related emotions would be hard
to fake, given their autonomic origins, and the costs of placing their activation under
conscious control [30, 28]. However, it remains to be shown that love in particular has
these attributes, and that it cannot be displayed while attending to costs.
Our formalism adds novel insights to Frank’s argument about love. First, our model
12
clarifies that falling in or out of love depends on the distribution of temptations, but not
their immediate realizations. This suggests people will fall out of love when there is a
permanent change in alternative mating opportunities or relationship costs, but not a
one-off temptation. For example, a man may fall out of love with his wife after becoming
unexpectedly successful, as many more women will be now be interested in him than
he anticipated when they first met. Second, the model clarifies that love comes with a
cost–the cost of ignored temptations–and suggests that this cost must be compensated
with commensurate investment in the relationship. Only sometimes is it worthwhile for
the recipient of love to compensate a suitor, which explains why people actively avoid the
strong affections of those with whom they do not wish to have long-term relationships.
Third, our model clarifies why mere discussions of the costs and benefits of a relationship
or a break-up, for example, suggesting a prenuptial agreement, damage the relationship.
Such discussions indicate that one is looking at the costs of the relationship and cast
doubt on one’s commitment.
These arguments extend to anger. Anger can be thought of as “punishing without
looking”. It prevents people from looking at the costs of inflicting harm on others after a
transgression, thereby deterring future transgressions.

Figure 1: The Envelope Game
We model non-strategic cooperative behavior using what we call the envelope game. (a)
Column 1: The game begins when the temptation to defect is randomly chosen, as indicated
by a notice randomly being placed in the envelope. The temptation to defect is low
with probability p and high with probability 1 − p. Column 2: Then, player 1 chooses
whether to look (open the envelope) or not. Column 3: Player 1 then chooses whether to
cooperate or defect. Player 1 may only condition her action on the realized temptation
determined in column 1 if she looked. Each time player 1 cooperates, then, regardless of
whether player 1 looked, player 1 gets a > 0 and player 2 gets b > 0. Each time player
1 defects, her payoffs depend on whether defection was tempting. If it was not tempting,
player 1 gets c l > a and if it was tempting, player 1 gets c h > c l . In either case, each time
player 1 defects, player 2 gets d < 0. Column 4: Player 2, having observed both of player
1’s choices, chooses whether to continue or exit. If player 2 continues, with probability w,
all previous steps are repeated, potentially indefinitely.
Figure 2: Payoffs for a Restricted Set of Strategies in the Envelope Game
This table presents the payoffs for the restricted set of strategies used for the replicator
analysis. Player 1’s strategies are presented in separate rows, and player 2’s strategies
are presented in columns. The payoffs presented in the intersection of a given row and
column are those that the players receive if they play the corresponding strategies. For
example, consider what happens if player 1 looks and cooperates only if the temptation is
low (penultimate row) and player 2 repeats continues when player 1 cooperates (middle
column). Then, player 1’s expected payoff is [ap + c h (1 − p)] [1 − pw] (the first entry in
the corresponding cell) and player 2’s is [bp + d(1 − p)] [1 − pw] (the second entry in the
20
same cell; for details of calculations leading to payoffs, see appendix). This calculation
is the result of the following logic: each time the temptation is low, player 1 cooperates
and gets a, player 2 gets b, and the game continues with probability w until the first
time the temptation is high. We refer to the strategy where player 1 cooperates without
looking (top row) as CWOL. We also refer to the strategy pair where player 1 CWOLs
and player 2 continues if player 1 CWOLs (first column) as CWOL. We refer to the
strategy pairs where player 1 cooperates with or without looking and player 2 continues
if player 1 cooperates (first and second row, and middle middle column) as CWL. We
refer to the strategy pair where player 1 always defects and player 2 always exits (bottom
row and rightmost column) as ALLD. ALLD is always an equilibrium of the envelope
game. CWOL is an equilibrium if a/(1 − w) > c l p + c h (1 − p). CWL is an equilibrium if
a/(1 − w) > c h . This region is a subset of the region for which CWOL is an equilibrium.
Figure 3: Learning Dynamics of the Envelope Game
We apply the replicator dynamic to the envelope game restricted to the strategies represented
in figure 2. The replicator dynamic describes strategies evolving over time under
the assumption that the rate of reproduction within each population is proportional to
the fitness relative to that type’s other strategies. The replicator dynamic also models
learning dynamics such as reinforcement learning or prestige-biased imitation. We run
1000 time series with randomly seeded strategy frequencies for a range of values of a, and
record the frequency with which they stabilize in one of the strategy pairs identified in
figure 2, or in a behaviorally equivalent equilibrium, as presented in the simplexes. We
vary the value of a along the x-axis. The y-axis represents frequencies, and each colored
line presents the frequency of the strategy pair. The parameter region where the strategy
pair is supported as an equilibrium is shaded in light red. CWOL is supported as an
21
equilibrium in the region a ≥ a ∗ = (1 − w) · [c l p + c h (1 − p)], and emerges often in this
parameter region. CWL is supported as an equilibrium in a strictly smaller parameter
region, a ≥ a ∗ = (1 − w) · c h . Neither CWOL nor CWL emerge in the parameter regions
where they are not supported in equilibrium.

Hamas based its launchers in precisely those places. So it was not easy. At one
point, we announced a call-up of reserves. We hinted at a possible ground
incursion. But both Bibi and I knew we were going to avoid that if at all possible,
and we did. Though there were inevitable civilian casualties, most of the
Palestinians killed were Hamas fighters and leaders, including not just Jabari but
the head of Hamas’s rocket program. By limiting ourselves to air strikes and naval
fire, the Palestinian death toll was around 150, about one-tenth of what it had been
in 2008. Six Israelis, including four civilians, lost their lives. On the 21* of
November, the cease-fire was announced.

Yet with the election approaching, and my time in public life drawing to a
close, I had no illusion that this latest military operation, or future ones, would
bring us closer to the negotiating peace with the Palestinians that had eluded us
since Oslo. Nor was I confident that, having been unable to mount a military strike
of our own on Iran, Obama’s “bigger, stronger kid” in the schoolyard would take
military action. I did trust him to do all he could to use diplomacy to constrain
Iran’s efforts to get a bomb. I feared he might fail. Even if he succeeded, I figured
the best case would be an agreement that, at least on paper, delayed the Iranians’
development of a weapon. My hope remained that Israel’s relationship with the
Americans would be sufficiently strong for us to reach a formal understanding of
what form of surgical military strike each of our countries might take if Iran didn’t
honor the terms of a negotiated deal.

When I first left political life after my election defeat in 2001, I'd described my
status as the equivalent of a reserve officer. I said, and believed, it was unlikely P’'d
return for the foreseeable future. But I knew it wasn’t impossible. This time was
different. When I announced publicly that I was leaving politics, five days after the
Gaza cease-fire, I pointed that I had spent the greater part of my life as a soldier.
I’d never had a burning desire to be a politician. Though I believed that what I'd
attempted, and achieved, in government would prove to have safeguarded and
strengthened Israel, I knew that important challenges and decisions still lay ahead.
So did our unfulfilled dream of being a country that was not just strong, secure and
prosperous, but socially just and at peace. Yet I believed it was right to draw my
time on the front line of politics to an end. Though I didn’t say so, I thought to
myself: this time doesn’t feel like a step back into the reserves, but genuinely like
the end of something. Though my dedication to a secure, strong, just, democratic
and ultimately peaceful Israel would not change, whatever contribution I might

Swiss Accounts Survey 
Dear Mr Epstein, 
We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in 
London, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present. 
It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and 
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. 
There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, 
UK domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money. 
We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts

1) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money. 
We will be particularly concerned with these questions: 
2) Why you had Swiss accounts. 
3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. 
Additionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that: 
4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were 
sentenced to 18 months in prison. 
5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr Leslie Wexner. 
6) You are known to be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Kevin 
Spacey. 
7) You have made substantial contributions to the Clintons' philanthropic causes. Tax reform campaigners 
have previously been critical of those who engage in public life or the political process while avoiding or 
evading tax. Hilary Clinton herself, speaking in 2012, noted the importance of elites paying a substantial 
share of tax: One of the issues that I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an 
equitable manner — especially from the elites in every country.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016122.txt,"Targeting a stable oil price

As a matter of Saudi policy, we would expect a preference for oil market stability over
volatility, in line with recent official pronouncements. Although volatility makes it more
difficult for high cost unconventional producers to operate, volatility is also damaging
for Saudi Arabia and long-term planning domestically. For instance, no budget was
announced for 1986 due to uncertainties in the world oil market, with monthly current
appropriations set at one-twelfth of estimated actual expenditures for the prior year.
We think Saudi authorities view possible eventual sharp upward price spikes in the oil
price as damaging to both oil-consuming and oil-producing countries.

Future investment decisions will be critical for oil prices

Spare capacity is an important policy parameter for Saudi Arabia. In addition to its
influence on prices through its ability to adjust production, Saudi can decide on the pace
of its reserves development which would potentially affect future supply. There are
distinct trade-offs in this decision. If Saudi Arabia is producing at close to its maximum
capacity, it will have little control over sharp upside movements in oil prices. If excess
capacity is large, oil prices are likely to be under downward pressure.

In the near-term, given the uncertainty in the market, in our view, there is likely little
incentive for Saudi Arabia to embark on a program to invest and increase capacity from
the current level. New investments may still be made to offset declines in existing
fields. Over time however, our commodities research medium-term oil balances suggest
that Saudi’s spare capacity would be eroded over time unless further increases in spare
capacity take place. Our BofAML commodities research medium-term supply-demand
balances suggest an increased call on OPEC and need to increase production capacity. In
2004-09, Aramco invested cUS$100bn into its largest-ever capacity expansion program,
which increased total capacity from 10mn bpd to 12.5mn bpd. For now, Aramco has
suggested it will not slow down its hydrocarbon capex program for the next three years
as cuts were achieving through savings in drilling costs and supplier discounts.

Energy policy is likely to be less aggressive going forward

We expect a less aggressive energy policy going forward, particularly as the NTP
suggests a constant oil production capacity and an increase in gas production
domestically. This is in line with Saudi Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral
Resources Al-Falih’s pronouncements during the June Ordinary OPEC meeting. While his
comments served to project increased OPEC institutional credibility and increased
rapprochement with fellow OPEC members, he suggested that Saudi Arabia will remain
responsive to customer needs but dismissed fears that increasing Saudi market share
would take place in an aggressive manner (that could drive prices lower again).

Downstream operations - increased focus

Saudi Aramco’s downstream integration drive is likely being pursued for two core
reasons: (1) to support demand for Saudi crude (placing own crude in own refining
capacity) and (2) a risk reduction mechanism in a highly volatile oil environment (having
an integrated value chain allows capture of margins from well to the forecourt,
promoting stability). In reflection, Saudi Aramco is building highly sophisticated
refineries domestically, in addition to already completed joint-ventures and stakes in
refineries abroad (China, US, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia). Domestic joint-venture (JV)
refineries Satorp and Yasref added 400k bpd each of capacity in 2H14. With the
completion of the fully-owned Jazan 400k bpd refinery in 2018/19, overall total refinery
capacity would stand at 5.7mn bpd, of which Saudi Aramco’s share would be 3.3mn bpd.
This would allow Saudi Arabia to guarantee security of demand for its heavy crude,
increase domestic job creation and diversification, build an export base of refined
products (likely middle distillates to the EU) and lower imports of refined products.

LAWYER: EPSTEIN MADE ADMISSIONS ON TAPE
MICHELE DARGAN, Daily News Staff Writer

Published: April 29, 2010 ee

A tape recorded interview between a reporter and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein contains t ns

damning admissions by Epstein,” which includes Epstein saying he had come close to crossing a line -

concerning sex with underage girls. H

Those and other revelations about the 22-minute interview by New York Daily News reporter George Rush Palm Beach Dal ly News

with Epstein are contained in a 24-page court filing by attorneys Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell on behalf NEWSLETTERS

of Jane Doe. Edwards represents Doe and two other Epstein victins. Edwards and Cassell are fighting to

obtain the tape to further their case of sexual abuse by Epstein when Doe was a minor.

Epstein, 57, was released from jail in July after serving 13 months of an 18-month state sentence for

soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. Nearly two dozen young women have filed

lawsuits against Epstein -- some already settled -- all alleging Epstein sexually abused them as minors at

his El Brillo Way home, where he is now serving house arrest.

The New York Daily News is seeking to keep the tape confidential, citing reporter's protected privilege.

In response, Cassell says the newspaper waived its protected privilege when Rush played the recording

for three people and described its contents to two others, including Edwards.

In addition, Cassell writes that privilege can't be applied in this situation because it doesn't involve an

issue related to a confidential source. The person on the tape is Epstein.

Even if there is qualified privilege, Cassell maintains it is outweighed by Doe's inability to obtain the

information anywhere else and her “compelling need to obtain Jeffrey Epstein's own words about his

sexual abuse and lack of remorse.

When reached by phone Wednesday, Anne Carroll, attorney for the New York Daily News, said she will

answer Cassell in a court filing. Both the New York Daily News and Doe have asked a federal court judge

in Manhattan to listen to the tape in chambers to help determine whether privilege applies.

Epstein and others who helped him procure minor girls for massages and sex acts have taken the Fifth

Amendment in their depositions, stymieing Doe and the other victims suing Epstein, the documents say.

Michael Fisten, an investigator working for Doe, discovered the existence of the tape in fall 2009. An

author who had listened to the tape told Fisten that Rush had a tape recording of Epstein discussing the

sexual abuse of minor girls.

According to a sworn affidavit by Fisten, he called Rush, who confirmed he interviewed Epstein and made

a tape. According to Fisten, Rush told him that he compiled negative information from Epstein about his

exploits with underage girls and how he eluded the justice system. But Fisten said that Rush told him that

his publisher, who knows Epstein, killed it after receiving a call from Epstein.

Fisten said Rush told him, among other things, that the following information was contained on the tape:

That Epstein said he went to jail in Florida for no reason and if the sexual abuse of minors had happened

in New York, he would have only received a $200 fine.

That L.M., one of Edwards’ clients who sued Epstein for sexual abuse as a minor, came to him as a

prostitute and a drug user (meaning she came to him for sex, rather than him pursuing her).

That all the girls suing him are only trying to get a meal ticket.

That the only thing he might have done wrong was to maybe cross the line a little too closely.

In a sworn deposition, Edwards states that Rush disclosed much of the information contained on the tape

to him in a conversation.

Edwards said in his statement that the Rush interview is unique and not otherwise obtainable from other

witnesses because it can be used to prove perjury -- a federal crime.

Edwards said Epstein testified in a deposition that he did not recognize the name George Rush from the

New York Daily News despite the fact that he gave a personal interview that we all now know to have

been tape recorded.”

face of a Fed tightening cycle makes the BRL especially vulnerable in 2017. We would
recommend buying MXN against BRL as a relative value trade.

5. The best hedge against escalation of trade friction

The rise of populism means that policies will become less predictable and less market
friendly. This should be especially true in the area of international trade. Even though a
trade war is not our central scenario, the risk of trade friction will likely be much greater
than anything we have seen in recent years.

For Donald Trump’s trade policy to work he needs a weak USD. Meanwhile, with
increased concerns about the long-term ill effect of debt-fuelled expansion, Beijing
seems to have become resigned that China needs a weaker RMB (Chart 11}. This could
set the US and China on a collision course in 2017. To hedge against the possibility of
an escalation of trade tension between China and the US, we would recommend buying
a 10 delta USD call/CNH put that would benefit from either an increase in risk premium
or an acceleration of renminbi depreciation between now and the inauguration of the
new US president on January 20 (Chart 12).

6. Contagious populism will benefit the GBP

Brexit and the election of Donald Trump could help bolster nationalistic and anti-
globalization parties elsewhere by lending legitimacy to their causes. With major
elections coming up in France, Holland and Germany next year and the possibility of
early elections in Italy, investors will be on tenterhooks, as anti-globalization movements
could further undermine public support for the European project at a time that the
Eurozone is still recovering from the peripheral crisis.

It is not our central scenario that right wing parties will take power in any of these
countries next year. However, after the surprise victories of the Brexit camp and Trump,
investors are likely to demand greater risk premium ahead of these votes. We think this
could lead to further reversal of the rally in EUR/GBP this year and would recommend
selling the cross at the current level.

7. Not all reflation trades are born equal

Reflation trades have skyrocketed since the US election. Commodities, mining stocks,
commodity currencies, and inflation indexed bonds generally have outperformed.
However, we would caution against the indiscriminate buying of inflation-linked assets,
as the general theme is not supported by fundamentals in all inflation-linked markets.

Eurozone 10y20y inflation breakeven has jumped over the past week to 1.96%, near the
year’s high, but more importantly, approaching the ECB’s “below but close to 2%”

The art world heats up once more
Wednesday, 13th October 2010

Timothy Barber has a look around Frieze Art Fair, which opens to the public today

AS an army of glamorous art industry movers and shakers traipsed into Frieze Art Fair’s marquee yesterday, a
young woman was standing outside distributing paper leaflets for an upcoming exhibition. Not that surprising
perhaps — some galleries need all the help they can get publicising themselves — except that the gallery in
question was the Royal Academy. That London’s most august art institution should find itself flyering outside a
tent in Regent’s Park is one measure of the extent to which the capital’s art scene now triangulates itself around
Frieze.

There are others. The National Gallery’s new exhibition of works by the 18th century Venetian artist Canaletto has
coincided with Frieze this week; the merry-go-round of satellite exhibitions now includes one from The Saatchi
Gallery — its owner, Charles Saatchi, practically gave birth to London’s contemporary art scene as we know it, after

Picasso alongside Richter, Murakami and Hirst; and of course, Frieze now dictates the timing of the contemporary
art auctions that are the most immediate signifier of the health — or otherwise — of the art market.

As far as that goes, Anders Petterson, managing director of art market analyst ArtTactic, says the mood is
cautiously optimistic. After a rotten 2009, record-breaking February sales apparently signified a return to business
as normal, but momentum slowed in the summer with some shows falling significantly short.

“People got carried away with the rebound earlier in the year and sellers got a little greedy with the estimates
they demanded, so the summer sales were a bit down,” Petterson says. “Since then the market has revived a bit,
and people are being more realistic about the situation.”

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021379.txt,"In the case of loneliness interventions,
all of the reviews essentially confirmed
the findings of previous reviews that
social skills training and group-based
interventions can succeed in reducing
loneliness. Is this conclusion justified, or
is this a case in which prior conclusions
have been perpetuated in the manner
Kuhn describes?

To combat bias favoring results
that confirm dominant theories, some
scientists have argued that specific study
criteria should be met to warrant an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the
intervention (18). These criteria include
random assignment of study participants
to receive the intervention, evidence that
the intervention is more effective than no
intervention, findings that are replicated
by at least one independent research
group, and results that are published in
peer-reviewed journals. Previous
reviewers of loneliness interventions
have, in fact, placed a premium on
randomized trials that contrast a group
randomly selected to receive the
intervention with a group randomly
selected to receive no intervention.
However, none has employed meta-
analysis, a quantitative technique for
calculating the average effect of diverse
interventions designed to accomplish the
same goal. Whereas qualitative reviews
are subjective and vulnerable to
confirmatory biases, quantitative reviews
are objective and relatively impervious
to bias as long as all relevant studies are
included in the analysis.

To minimize bias in our meta-
analysis, we first combed the literature
to identify all the intervention studies
that specifically targeted loneliness. To
further meet our criteria for inclusion in
the meta-analysis, studies had to be
published in a peer-reviewed journal or
as a doctoral dissertation (to ensure the

scientific integrity of the findings),
between 1970 and 2009 (to include and
extend the time interval reviewed
qualitatively in prior research), and had
to measure loneliness quantitatively.

Fifty-two intervention studies for
loneliness met our inclusion criteria.
These studies were divided into three
categories based on the experimental
design used to assess the effects of the
intervention. Twelve studies used a
single group pre-post design in which
loneliness among participants was
assessed at baseline and again after
exposure to the intervention. The single
pre-post design is weak in terms of
measuring the effectiveness of an
intervention, however, because
individuals who have high scores on a
loneliness measure on one occasion are
likely to score less extremely on a
second occasion even if no intervention
had occurred. Said differently, people
whose measurements suggest they are
very lonely at one point in time, on
average, appear to be less lonely when
measured at a later point in time. Our
meta-analysis of these studies indicated
there was indeed a lowering of
loneliness as measured before and after
the interventions, but we cannot
conclude from this evidence that the
reductions in loneliness were due to the
interventions.

Eighteen studies utilized a non-
randomized group comparison design in
which some of the participants sought
out the intervention (the experimental
group) while others (the control group)
did not. In this design, assignment of
individuals to the experimental or
control groups was based upon
convenience, participant preference, or
some other factor, which means the
groups that did and did not receive the
intervention may differ in ways that

what he called “legal impediments,” including the belief that many of Epstein’s
teenage victims were too “terrified” to cooperate in the case.

“Given the obstacles we faced in fashioning a robust federal prosecution, we decided
to negotiate a resolution,” said Sloman, now in private practice. “We did not reach
this decision lightly and it came only after significant and often rancorous internal
debate.”

Jeffrey Sloman, who was second-in-command to then-U.S. Attorney Alexander
Acosta when the latter was deciding whether to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein, says the
office handled the case properly. Aixa Montero Holt

In a lengthy opinion piece submitted to the Miami Herald Editorial Board, Sloman
alleges that the attacks on Acosta’s role in the controversial case are politically
driven by critics who failed to raise significant issues when Acosta was nominated
and confirmed as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017.

Sloman’s comments come two weeks after the Justice Department announced it had
opened an investigation over whether there was prosecutorial misconduct in the
case involving Epstein, who ran a sex pyramid scheme from his Palm Beach estate

In which we learn why networks spread so quickly.

In 1959 a young aeronautical engineer named Paul Baran, who had been working at
Howard Hughes’ aircraft design factory in Los Angeles, arrived for his first day at
work at a low-slung, modern building along the Santa Monica beach in California.
RAND - astylish 1950’s acronym for Research & Development - had been
established by the US Air Force with an ambitious aim: How might the best minds of
math and science be bent to the purpose of winning the Cold War? RAND was a
dream destination for many researchers, offering a fusion of patriotism, technology
and California sun. The place became known for a relaxed, intellectual atmosphere -
an energy of open creativity that belied the dangerous, nuclear-tipped problems
sitting inside its locked safes and eager minds. Shortly after settling in, Baran was
given one of the most troubling, deeply secret of these puzzles.

The Cold War was then in its early days. The debate over how to manage an age
when it was, for the first time, possible for humans to destroy the planet was
colored still by fresh memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was charged too with
the fear of communist expansion, not an unreasonable worry for Americans who
had just fought a world war against two other, dangerously totalitarian forces. A
cold fear lingered in the minds of many citizens and military planners: Given a
window of vulnerability, might the USSR loose a fast nuclear attack? Avoiding sucha
risk became a primary concern of American diplomacy and defense thinking,
particularly in the establishment of some sort of deterrent to a Soviet attack.
Moscow had to know, and trust, that any attempt to strike-first would be met with a
devastating reply. “The chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win
wars,” the nuclear strategist Bernard Brodie wrote in a 1946 memo. “From now on
its chief purpose must be to avert them.”!°4 Deterrence rested on this hope that the
USSR would be persuaded not to launch a snap-strike because of the certainty of a
nation-levelling reply. This logic, this “balance of threat” depended in turn on
America’s ability to launch such a strike. If the Soviets could wipe out America’s
ability to respond, then Moscow’s leaders might move first, snap of America’s claws,
and then pick the world apart at their leisure. If Krushchev’s famous, mocking
dangerous ”We will bury you!” line from 1956 really meant what it said, then sucha
move would provide an awfully convenient first shovel.

In the late 1950s, when Baran arrived at RAND, the Cold War was at its chilliest and
one of the most carefully guarded American secrets was this: If the USSR attacked,

¢ We keep our preference for US equities relative to other developed equity markets. Earnings continued
to hold up better than in other regions during the recent economic slowdown. Continued economic
growth should allow companies to show mid single digit earnings growth over the coming 12 months.

e The US central bank's (Fed) very pro-growth oriented policy stance is a clear advantage for the local
equity market; the recent introduction of additional quantitative easing (QE 3) is positive for riskier assets.
° We still expect some potential for re-rating over the coming 6 months, in terms of increases in the price-
to-earnings ratio (P/E).

¢ The debate around the fiscal cliff implies increased uncertainty over the coming months. However, we
think that a 20% discount compared to the long-run PE-average provides some cushion, and our base case
assumes that politicians will finally achieve a compromise to avoid economic contraction.

4 Positive scenario S&P 500 (6-month target): 1,700

e An accelerating US and global economy reduces risks to company earnings. Investors begin to shift funds
into more cyclical sectors such as Industrials and Materials in light of better growth prospects. In this

specifically, how do we get businesses
to do more in terms of hiring, spend
less on redtape, less on bureaucracy,
and reduce the regulatory burden in
smart ways?

The current administration has said
some of the right things but actually
moved in the wrong direction. We have
seen a sharp increase in the last couple
of years in what are deemed to be
major economically significant rules.
That is defined as regulations that im-
pose a cost on the economy of $100 mil-
lion or more.

According to the administration’s Of-
fice of Management and Budget, the
current administration has been regu-
lating at a pace of 84 major rules per
year. By way of comparison, that is
about a 50-percent increase over the
regulatory output during the Clinton
administration, which had about 56
rules per year, and an increase from
the Bush administration as well. So we
have seen more regulations and more
significant regulations.

I was encouraged to hear President
Obama’s words when he talked about
the Executive order in January, which
is entitled ‘‘Improving Regulation and
Regulatory Review.’”’ But now we need
to see action. We need to see it from
the administration, from individual
agencies to provide real regulatory re-
lief for job creators to be able to reduce
this drag on the economy.

One commonsense step we can take is
to strengthen what is called the Un-
funded Mandates Relief Act. It was
passed in 1995. It was bipartisan. I was
a cosponsor in the House of Represent-
atives. It is an effort to require Federal
regulators to evaluate the cost of rules,
to look at the benefits and the costs,
and to look at less costly alternatives
on rules.

The two amendments I would like to
offer over the next few days as we con-
sider the legislation before us would
improve this Unfunded Mandates Re-
form Act, and it would reform it in
ways that are entirely consistent with
the principle President Obama has laid
out and committed to in his Executive
order on regulatory review.

The first amendment would require
agencies specifically to assess poten-
tial effects of new regulations on job
creation—so focusing in on jobs—and
to consider market-based and non-
governmental alternatives to regula-
tion. This would broaden the scope of
the Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to
require cost-benefit analysis of rules
that impose direct or indirect costs of
$100 million a year or more. So, again,
this is for major rules of $100 million or
more. It would also require agencies to
adopt the least costly or least burden-
some option that achieves whatever
policy goals have been set out by Con-
gress. It seems to me it is a common-
sense amendment. I hope we will get
bipartisan support for it.

The second amendment would extend
the Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to
so-called independent agencies which
today are actually exempt from the

cost-benefit rules that govern all other
agencies. In 1995, we had this debate
and determined at that time we would
not extend the legislation to inde-
pendent agencies. In the interim, inde-
pendent agencies have been providing
more and more rules, have put out
more and more regulations, and are
having a bigger and bigger impact. An
example of an independent agency
would be the SEC, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, or the CFTC,
which is the Commodity Futures Trad-
ing Commission. These are agencies
that, although independent in the exec-
utive branch, are very much involved
in putting out major rules and regula-
tions. It is sometimes called the ‘‘head-
less fourth branch’’ of government be-
cause their rules are not reviewed for
cost-benefit analysis, even by the OMB,
the Office of Management and Budget,
in its Office of Information and Regu-
latory Affairs, so-called OIRA.

We have looked at some GAO data
and put together various studies, and it
appears to us that there are about 200
regulations that were issued between
1996 until today that would be deemed
to have an impact of $100 million or
more on the economy but were auto-
matically excluded from the Unfunded
Mandates Relief Act because they were
deemed to be from independent agen-
cies.

So it is basically closing a loophole
and closing this independent agency
loophole, which I believe is a sensible
reform. It has been endorsed by many
people, including, interestingly, the
current OIRA Administrator and the
President’s regulatory czar, Cass
Sunstein, who, in a 2002 Law Review ar-
ticle, talked about the fact that this is
an area where UMRA ought to be ex-
tended because, again, there were so
many independent agencies that were
putting out regulations impacting job
creation in this country.

No regulation, whatever its source,
should be imposed on American em-
ployers or on State and local govern-
ments without serious consideration of
the costs, the benefits, and the avail-
ability of a least-burdensome alter-
native. Both these amendments would
move us further toward that sensible
goal, and I hope the leadership will
allow these amendments to be offered.
I think they fit well with the under-
lying legislation. If they are offered, I
certainly urge my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to support them.

TRIBUTE TO LOUIS E. GIVAN

Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I
rise today to recognize a distinguished
Kentuckian who has worked tirelessly
on behalf of our Nation’s soldiers, sail-
ors and marines for more than 40 years.
Louis E. Givan, a lifelong resident of
my hometown of Louisville, has played
a vital role in protecting the men and
women of our Armed Forces and our
country’s defense.

Formerly a sailor himself in the U.S.
Navy, he has served for the last 11
years as the general manager of
Raytheon Missile Systems operations
in Louisville. I was saddened to hear of
his retirement from that position this
coming July 5. He will certainly be
missed.

Mr. Givan—or, to those who know
him, Ed—was a 1966 graduate of St. Xa-
vier High School in Louisville and in
1970 earned his bachelor of science de-
gree in mechanical engineering from
the J.B. Speed School of Engineering
at the University of Louisville. In 1968,
he began working at the Naval Ord-
nance Station in Louisville, and he
stayed at that post until 1996, in var-
ious engineering and supervisory posi-
tions.

In 1996 the Naval Ordnance Station
transitioned to private ownership, and
Ed's leadership was crucial in making
that transition a successful one. The
facility eventually became part of
Raytheon Missile Systems, and Ed was
appointed general manager in 2000. As
general manager, Ed has led Raytheon
Missile Systems in Louisville to great
success, success for both the company
and for the local community. They de-
sign, develop, and produce vital weap-
ons systems for our armed forces, ena-
bling America to have the most formi-
dable military force in the world.
Weapons produced at the Louisville fa-
cility are used by our forces in all parts
of the globe, including in Iraq.

Kentucky is lucky to have benefitted
from Ed’s dedication, commitment to
excellence, and leadership for so many
years. I am sure his wife Velma; his
sons Eddie, Tony, and Chris; and his
grandchildren Benjamin, Nathan,
Isaac, Macy and Natalie are all very
proud of what Ed has accomplished. I
wish him the very best in retirement,
and I am sure my colleagues join me in
saying that this U.S. Senate thanks
Mr. Louis E. ‘‘Ed’’ Givan for his faith-
ful service.

CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS ACT

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the following letter
be printed in the RECORD.

There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012719
"
IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016136.txt,"be equivalent to a SAR100bn cumulative spending cut, which we believe can be
accommodated from capex retrenchment. On the basis of the above, fiscal consolidation
would likely drive real GDP growth lower to an average of just around 1% of GDP. This
estimate is based on a ST GCC fiscal multiplier of 0.2 for real spending to real non-oil
GDP, in line with academic literature.

Fx policy stays the course; NTP blurs medium-term incentives

We do not believe Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is considering Fx reform
in the near-term. We have expressed here our view that the Fx peg would hold as fiscal
policy undergoes a sizeable multi-year adjustment. In a bearish scenario for oil prices,
the NTP is unlikely to be implemented as deep budget cuts are likely to be required to
sustain the Fx policy. We believe an oil price of at least US$50/bbl is broadly consistent
with full and timely NTP implementation, but fiscal policy still needs to be disciplined. If
fiscal non-oil revenue targets are missed, a higher oil price is likely to be needed.

However, if the NTP is successful in diversifying the economy, it will make the costs of
running an overvalued exchange rate more prohibitive, particularly as the external
accounts are likely to become more responsive to an Fx shock. It also introduces a pro-
growth bias for policy-makers in charge of diversifying the economy, which may conflict
with the implementation of unpopular fiscal reforms or the depth of fiscal consolidation
needed at weak levels of oil prices. The NTP diversification initiatives may suffer from a
timing mismatch when it comes to net external receipts generated. This is because the
sectors that would generate Fx receipts (non-oil exports, religious tourism) or
localization policies are likely to be slow to ramp-up, while Fx demand in the economy is
likely to be supported (rather than deflated) by government diversification policies. Last,
the desire to build a large SWF may suggest a desire to conserve Fx reserves.

Newsweek

Robert Gates: America Is losing its grip

John Barry and Tara McKelvey

27 June -- Aboard the Pentagon jet on his last foreign trip as secretary
of defense, Robert Gates takes a moment to peer across the American
horizon--and the view is dire: the U.S. is in danger of losing its
supremacy on the global stage, he says.

T've spent my entire adult life with the United States as a
superpower, and one that had no compunction about spending what it
took to sustain that position, he tells NEWSWEEK, seated in the
strategic communications center of the Boeing E-4B. It didn't have
to look over its shoulder because our economy was so strong. This is
a different time. A pause. To tell you the truth, that's one of the
many reasons it's time for me to retire, because frankly I can't imagine
being part of a nation, part of a government ... that's being forced to
dramatically scale back our engagement with the rest of the world.
Such a statement--rather astonishing for the leader of the world's
preeminent fighting force--may open the administration to charges of
not believing in American exceptionalism, an opening the GOP is
already trying to exploit. But these days Gates is less worried about
political crossfire and more focused on the legacy of his own tenure,
which bridged the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack
Obama. He is determined to define his own legacy as Pentagon boss,
and eager to push back against one of the more vocal criticisms of his
tenure: the belief among many liberals and some conservative budget
hawks that in a time of deep indebtedness, he hasn't been willing to
chop enough of a defense budget bloated by a decade of war. Don't
expect him to apologize. In Gates's mind, it's other political leaders
with less experience who are confused.

However, because of the false internet trafficking links between Plaintiffs and Epstein, Fox states
that it cannot place anymore models with Plaintiff MC2 until the allegations are cleared up.

18. Before the false links between Plaintiff and Epstein surfaced, Plaintiff Brunel was
earning a great deal of revenue from MC2 Miami.

19. The false links between Plaintiffs and Epstein began to surface online in about 2005-
2006. Then, in 2006, Plaintiffs received a letter of credit from Epstein at 5% interest. Plaintiffs
then made an investment totaling one-million dollars with Elite Paris, to start a company.

20. Next, Plaintiff Brunel started the company, “E Management”, to work with Elite Models
in Paris, Plaintiff had to close it almost immediately, because Elite didn’t send any models to
Plaintiff MC2 for fear of being linked to Epstein.

21. Because the false links between Plaintiffs and Epstein began to gain strength online, Elite
Paris severed the agreement due entirely to these false links. Plaintiff Brunel lost his investment
of one-million dollars because of this loss of business.

22. Plaintiffs lost potentially ten-million dollars in profits due to this initial one-million dollar
loss.

23. Additionally, a former financial controller of MC2, Maritza Vasquez, stated in a 2012
deposition that Plaintiff Brunel had never done anything inappropriate or illegal with any under-
age model. (Exhibits H! & H2 -Transcript of Deposition of Maritza Vasquez).

24. Maritza Vasquez was fired from her job at Plaintiff MC2 for embezzling company funds,
and had criminal charges filed against her (Composite Exhibit I attached). She was also the
source of the false information linking Plaintiffs to sex trafficking in the articles written by

Conchita Sarnoff of the website Jezebel (Composite Exhibit A, p.2-7).

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, #892

(1) Time to Disclose. Unless the defendant has consented in writing, the probation officer must not submit a presentence report
to the court or disclose its contents to anyone until the defendant has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or has been found

guilty.

(2) Minimum Required Notice. The probation officer must give the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's
attorney, and an attorney for the government at least 35 days before sentencing unless the defendant waives this minimum
period. The attorney for the government shall, if any victim requests, communicate the relevant contents of the presentence
report to the victim.

The Rationale:

The presentence report plays a critical role in the federal sentencing process. The report contains information about the crime,
the background of the defendant, the impact of the crime on the victim, and other matters relevant to sentencing. Most
important, the report also contains a calculation under the Federal [*893] Sentencing Guidelines specifying a range for any

recommended prison sentence (e.g., forty-six to fifty-seven months). While judges need not slavishly impose a sentence within

236 237

this range, most trial judges give significant weight to the Guidelines calculation,

238

and appellate courts have
discouraged straying too far from the Guidelines without good reason.

The CVRA entitles victims to be heard on disputed Guidelines issues and, as a corollary, entitles them to the right to review
parts of the presentence report relevant to those issues. The CVRA gives victims the right to be reasonably heard at any public
proceeding in the district court involving ... sentencing ... .. 73? This codifies the right of crime victims to provide what is
known as a victim impact statement to the court. 74° The victim's right to be heard, however, is not narrowly circumscribed
to just impact information. To the contrary, the right conferred is a broad one - to be reasonably heard at the sentencing
proceeding.

The victim's right to be reasonably heard is best understood as giving the victim the opportunity to speak about disputed
issues regarding the Sentencing Guidelines calculation. As Senator Kyl explained, the right to be heard includes the right to
make sentencing recommendations:

When a victim invokes this right [to be heard] during ... sentencing proceedings, it is intended that the [sic] he or she be
allowed to provide all three types of victim impact [information]: the character of the victim, [*894] the impact of the crime
on the victim, the victim's family and the community, and sentencing recommendations. 7+!

A “sentencing recommendation will often directly implicate Guidelines issues. For example, if the victim wishes to
recommend a hundred-month sentence when the maximum guideline range is only fifty-seven months, that sentencing
recommendation is essentially meaningless unless a victim can provide a basis for recalculating the Guidelines or departing or
varying from them. 74?

236 See United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).

237 See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 350 F. Supp. 2d 910, 912 (D. Utah 2005) (giving heavy weight to Guidelines recommendation).

238 See, e.g., United States v. Dalton, 404 F.3d 1029 (8th Cir. 2005); United States v. Rogers, 400 F.3d 640 (8th Cir. 2005).

- it may be according to what will be announced in the program.

* Private sector now complains of high operating costs, and believes that this will become harmful to the
industry and in trade, what is the opinion of Your Highness regarding the high prices and the shrinking
economic situation?

- | do not think this is accurate, but the programs that will come out will stimulate the private sector very
strongly. Sales of the private sector will increase very strongly. If you spend hundreds of billions in a
short period of time, this will undoubtedly have a very positive effect on the private sector. | would like
to give you an example. In the past, we used to rely solely on government capital expenditure.
Nowadays, in the coming years, we will have high government capital spending, that is the first thing.
The second: there will be spending from the reserves mentioned in the fiscal balance program is 200
billion riyals for private sector development, this spending differs than the capital spending we are all
used to. Thirdly: and it is important- it is the spend of the Public Investment Fund. The Public Investment
Fund will spend in Saudi Arabia, after Aramco has been sold, more than SR 500 billion in just three years.
You can imagine this spending in the military industry, the automotive industry, the entertainment
industry, the tourism industry or in other industries. How will it affect all of the private sector, and this
will stimulate their sales in very strong manner in all sectors, both in the retail, transport, services sector
and so on.

* Will you impose taxes on corporate income?

- No, this has not and will not be mentioned in the program of financial balance. We mentioned that
there would be no taxes on wealth or any taxes on income.

* Companies coming to Saudi Arabia, Are there facilities for foreign investment?

- That is true, today, the Ministry of Commerce is working on screening the work of the Investment
Authority. We worked different than what was happening in the past of waiting for the demand comes
from the companies, but today we pick up the companies that we want to work in Saudi Arabia. There is
a very long list of companies that the Investment Authority must seize each year and enter them in the
Saudi market.

* Is there anyone who wants to enter but complain about the procedures we have?

- This is true, and they are all easy procedures and contribute very significantly to the work of these
companies. For example, remind you the last event in the visit of German Chancellor, the German
companies have had a problem that our license in Saudi Arabia only lasts for one year, while their
strategies and investments are based on four years. They have been given a change in this aspect so that
the license lasts for five years, this are easy procedures that greatly stimulate the work of foreign
companies in Saudi Arabia.

* With respect to the health sector, it means the privatization of the health sector, it was published on
the lips of the Minister in a symposium that the hospitals will be privatized, and then it was said that it

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027981.txt,"Barely two months after the ambush operation in south Lebanon, Black
September seized and murdered members of the Israeli team at the 1972
Olympics in Munich.

As soon as the news broke on the morning of September 5, I phoned Ahrahle
Yariv as head of military intelligence. “You need to send us,” I said. I tried to
persuade him that if it came down to an operation to free our hostages, Sayeret
Matkal offered the best hope that it would not end in a bloodbath. We had the
mind-set, the background, the training and now the experience. I also knew the
German military had no special-forces unit. ’'d have been even more worried if
I had known that German law barred the army from operating in peacetime.
That meant any use of force would be left to the police. Ahrahle told me it was
too early to say what involvement, if any, Israel might have. He’d get back in
touch with a decision when it came.

I called my officers together to begin planning. I decided to use the men who
had been with me for the Sabena mission, including Mordechai Rachamim. We
collated information from the stream of media reports from Munich and
assembled a rough idea of the layout of the building the terrorists had attacked.
As for the attackers, I said we had to assume there were at least half-a-dozen,
that they had not just AK-47s but grenades or other explosives. And that like the
Sabena hijackers, they would be prepared to die but hoping to live. All of that
turned out to be true. None of it, however, could alter the reply I got from
Ahrahle a couple of hours later. “We decided to send Zvika,” he said. Zvika
Zamir was the head of Mossad, and he would be going only as an observer. Any
operation against the terrorists would still be in the hands of German units.

The German police’s bungled attempt to end the ordeal was especially
painful because it was so predictable. I believe that if we had been there, at least
some of the eleven Israelis killed might not have lost their lives. The Germans
launched an ambush at a NATO airfield outside Munich, when the terrorists and
hostages were ostensibly on their way to board a flight for Cairo. We know now
that there was no properly co-ordinated plan. Too few police were deployed for
the operation. They were insufficiently armed, and they lacked relevant training
or experience. The result: a bloodbath. As a final insult to the memory of the
murdered Israelis, although the three surviving terrorists were jailed, the

Called to the stand, he told the real truth and not the 302 version of the truth. The Assistant U.S.
Attorney was frustrated and kept on confronting him with the 302” version.

Fed up with the prosecutor and in the presence of the jury, the witness preceded to recount my debate
over recording from the first interview. Pointing to me in the back of the courtroom, the witness
announced that I had warned him that they would pull this crap with the 302 report.

it didn't take the jury very long to acquit.

With the advent of DNA and groups like the Innocence Project, we have now seen that so-called
unrecorded confessions have put many innocent people in jail and even on Death Row. As a result,
_--agencies such as the BSO, now require all interviews tobe taped.

But not the FBI

Like anyone, including lawyers, the FBI wants to control the record of the interview. Taping hurts that
effort.

I'm not saying that it is FBI policy f to step over the line. But they have chalk on their shoes more often
than you can imagine.

So, what's should you do if the FBI comes calling?

First of all, the advice I am about to give is not for the a guy who was an LiaeveCEwE 8 witness to a bank
robbery.

I am talking about people who are being interviewed as part of the types of crimes that are best —
described as corruption, RICO, white collar, etc.

Those are the kinds of cases that involve tons of evidence. Giving an innocent, but incorrect answer to a
vague question could leave any of us in deep CaCa.

A case in point is the lead story in the September 26, 2009 Herald. Chris Walton, director of the
Broward County Transportation Department, was interviewed by two FBI agents.

He stated that they wanted to know if commissioners attempted to influence contracts.
 ™T told them no.

It may sound like’a simple straight forward Q-and-A but it ain t necessarily so. He may think his
interview and public statement ends the matter.

In actuality, he has thrown down the gauntlet in front of the FBI.

in clear breach of the rules of international law.

The Legal Status of Palestine

The UK's rule over Palestine contained flaws and several breaches.
The Mandatory Power (UK) was considered, by many international
lawyers, as a colonial power, which should have supervised the
Mandate Territory and developed it as an honest trustee, which it
failed to do.

In regards to sovereignty over Palestine during the years of the
Mandate, many international experts consider that sovereignty was
inherent to the people of that territory and was temporarily in the
hands of the League of Nations. Palestine was considered as an
embryo of a state.

It had its constitutions in 1922, its nationality law in 1925 and several

The Mandatory Power exerted all its efforts to help the Zionist
Organizations, represented by the Jewish Agency, the Jewish Keren
Ha' Kayemet, the Jewish Keren Ha'yesud and the Zionist Haganah
[the armed organization of the Jewish agency], to bring an influx of
Jewish immigrants into the Mandated Territory, to develop their own
independent economy, arms and to construct armed settlements, in all
Palestine.

All of this was claimed to be in conformity with the MD of Palestine,
which was the legal fig-leaf in concealing the real goals of both the
imperial power and Zionist Organizations.

During the whole of British rule, Palestinians revolted and
demonstrated, but the British forces dealt with these revolutionary
acts in utmost cruelty, putting them down and killing thousands of
Palestinian Arabs and deporting or imprisoning tens of thousands.

In 1947, the UK government, unable to control the strong Zionist

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012690.txt,"﻿Omar Quadhafi is hunkering down in Tripoli giving press interviews denying that rebels are taking over Eastern Libya. Oil prices are shooting over one hundred dollars a barrel. The US government is on the verge of a shut down. These are not the top secret opening lines to Aaron Sorkin’s new script, but the global headlines of a world spinning out of control. I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to attend the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat. 



For the second year nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle is down to two. The beloved timeless classic,  The King's Speech marches into the arena as the front runner, but passionate supporters of the brilliant edgier (and critics darling)  The Social Network have not conceded.  The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Filmmakers are exhausted from campaigning. 



At Bryan Lourd's famous star studded party Sony Classics' Co-President Michael Barker announces to me he has taken a random sampling of voters in the room. He says, There will be a 'Social Network' upset at the Kodak Theater.  Shear panic radiates from my every pore as he says, I am joking. It's like color war at summer camp.



Woody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists against each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. 



My event and publicity company is considered Switzerland by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to present and position his work. This year I am somewhat emotionally sucked in.  



In 2005 I meet the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO,Elizabeth I. The Emmy award winning movie stars Helen Mirren, who takes credit for discovering him directing English television. Helen later wins her Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in “The Queen”. Queen Elizabeth is the daughter of King George VI portrayed by Oscar winner Colin Firth in The King's Speech. 



I also become Hooper's champion encouraging many to see his early work including his herculean 10 hour HBO mini-series John Adams produced by Tom Hanks.



Six years later at the Telluride Film Festival Tom Hooper is bathing in the glory of a hysterical standing ovation with Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first screening of The King's Speech. Surprisingly, this drama's subtle humor gets big laughs leading up to its emotional ending.   



Within two weeks, at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein is now standing with his filmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The film wins The Audience Prize. Their strategy is to say nothing. Do nothing. They have a possible Oscar winner. Four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in Toronto.



Cut to New York City at the end of September.  It's the opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln Center.  One of America's most important and prolific producers Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical audience who have just seen The Social Network.



The film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for an Oscar.



The Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, where cool Yale/NYU student James Franco appears and receives a heroic standing ovation. More Oscar buzz.  



Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and even Harvey Weinstein slip in the back. Darren Aronofsky, sporting the ever present cool wool scarf around his neck is hailed a genius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. 



Both films are sensational and movie goers go nuts, but it is The King's Speech that edges out the competition for The Audience Prize.  



Mid-November David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg, working together for the third time, sneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, Clint Eastwood is going to kill himself for not directing this. Wahlberg says, You are wrong. He turned it down because he's done it. He has seen it and he loves it. I instantly lavish my affection and praise on David O. Russell, who becomes my new Clint Eastwood.  Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting actors to beat.



True Grit directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin doesn't premiere till mid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office gold. 



This is the year many of the 78 million Baby Boomers go back to the theaters. Five small budget independent films become surprise hits as each exceeds $100 million.  



The Social Network now cements its battle cry with one word; relevance.  Mark Zuckerberg lands on the cover of Time Magazine as The Person of the Year. A smart and extensive ad campaign positions the film in the lead. Critics and pundits proclaim the race is over. The Social Network is the clear winner. Everyone goes on holiday. 



This is probably the only time in Harvey Weinstein's life that he is caught off guard. He quickly mobilizes an inner team of 15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including Christmas. They become like a Chinese Restaurant...always open.   A generational war is in full swing. Harvey screens his film for the older voters. Everything is done by the books. Budgets are limited. He sends screenwriter David Seidler and Tom Hoooper to every corner of the country doing q+a's till they are blue in the face from finding their voice. SAG voters begin seeing the film 2 and 3 times.  





In January the Golden Globes voted on by about 88 foreign journalists gives Best Drama to The Social Network, Best Director to David Fincher and Best Screenplay to Aaron Sorkin. Their film is still perceived as the Oscar winner.  





Team Weinstein underestimates their hard work and is in shock when The King's Speech wins the PGA in L.A. Harvey doesn’t even attend and is working in Sundance. They are equally surprised when Tom Hooper wins the DGA and the actors win the SAG Ensemble.  The BAFTAs reinforced the lead. They are now the front runner. It takes the media a few weeks to catch on. 



The Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of “The King’s Speech” and is moved by the film.  With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, the Weinstein Company sends out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. They also acknowledge Prime Minister David Cameron’s private Christmas screening. 





On Oscar night, it isn't until Hilary Swank surprisingly yells out Hooper's name for Best Director that Harvey's gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture. The King has spoken.

 



Friday, February 24th

Mid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel, where I have stayed for thirty years. As the housekeepers unpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge and find icon Warren Beatty in a booth. He motions me over to meet an Egyptian fashion editor from Cairo. I say, Warren, you are a little late to visit Cairo. I tell him I'm rooting for Annette and love her film “The Kids Are All Right”. Warren tells me “The Social Network” will win.  



This year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I am now shown to a very very very small room, the size of a broom closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am moved. The housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes flying. I calm down. The hotel is sold out. I get someone else's room. Another poor schmuck checking in downstairs will get the broom closet.



It is cold, grey and rainy. Taffata, organdy and embroidered silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters and fur coat and head to Arianna Huffington's Mediterranean house in Beverly Hills where Wendi Murdoch and Arianna are hosting a party for Tom Freston's wife, the beautiful blond Kathy. The book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World. A perfect book for Monks. 





Arianna has just sold the Huffington Post for to AOL to $315 million dollars and rumored to have personally landed around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other drenched power players ushered in under umbrellas include Disney's Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay, Fox’s Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter Chloe Malle, Google's Eric Schmidt, Oliver Stone avoiding questions about Charlie Sheen and escorting his daughter Tara, Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, Tracey Ullman, CBS’s Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad Grey and fiancé Cassandra Marc and Jeff Bezos.  Hors d'oeuvres include pigs in blankets, a food group not mentioned in Kathy's book.  



The party action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus's home in the neighborhood for “True Grit’s” Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on the way in and he says, Keep me on your list. Is he kidding?  Sunrise and Mark Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, Focus Feature’s James Shamus, Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up with Justin Bieber. She giggles, Peg, I am only 14. 



Hunky Josh Brolin tells me he is coming to New York in March to shoot two new films. He is working on producing and starring in The Hunchback of Notre Dame with Tim Burton as a future project.



I am now inches away, face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him I love him in Morning Glory. He is looking at me in utter disbelief and I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is also inches away in a hat, glasses, jacket, layered sweater and scarves. I whisper to Harrison, That looks just like Johnny Depp.  Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend Johnny Depp. I babel a bit about his great work and run for cover to a corner next to my buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer. Jerry introduces me to the wives, Vanessa Paradis and Calista Flockhart. I bore them with girly chit-chat and realize it's time to get out of there. 



I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd Friday Night Party. Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. Cell phones do not work.  The world's most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. 



Bryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the door all night. Inside Uma tells me she finally moved into a doorman building in New York after being terrorized by stalkers for years. Talented, Ben Walker talks about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter he is about to shoot as his fiancé Mamie Gummer looks sexy shivering in a white satin gown. Producer Jon Kilik mentions he oversees a new cut of Julian Schnabel's Miral to be released in March.  Bennett Miller, standing with Kristin Gore says Sony loves his new film Moneyball and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not terrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an actual job decorating Jeffrey Katzenberg's home and he has never been happier. I congratulate Barry Levinson's son, Sam, a director, for winning the writing award at Sundance for his first film, Another Happy Day which is inspired by his family.



Also seen floating around are, Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal, but not together, Sean Penn, Tom Curise and Katie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa, Carrie Fisher, Bruce Weber, Sean Combs, Paul Haggis, Marisa Tomei, Jay Roach, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard Butler, Leo DiCaprio and Bar Refaeli, Renee Zellweger with Bradley Cooper, Biutiful director Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen Barkin who is headed to Broadway in The Normal Heart this spring and CAA’s Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda Queally.



Busy Bruce Cohen who is producing Sunday's awards broadcast tries to get his car to leave. Limo lock is at a standstill. Nothing is moving outside. Two hundred swells become party prisoners and resign to just having an absolute ball till 5:00am. Once again, this is the most star studded party in town. 



Saturday, February 26th, 2011



The sun comes up and dries up all the land. IAC chairmen and owner of The Newsweek/Daily Beast Barry Diller and his designer wife Diane Von Furstenberg host their annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Governor Jerry Brown, just elected to his third (nonconsecutive) term as California Governor. Diane’s children, Alex and Tatiana, along with their children comprise three generations of guests, which makes this party so special. 



Like last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic tables covered with yellow flowers sit on oriental rugs, covering the soggy ground. Terrines of hot soup, platters of sausages, fried chicken and salads are beautifully arranged on an endless buffet. Everyone wears winter clothes; comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive in a fur coat. 



Barry and Diane’s loyal friends have been coming to this party for over fifteen years. Everybody knows everybody and it doesn’t matter if you have a hit film or TV show this season. Oprah Winfrey kisses David Geffen, casually chats with former Disney CEO Michael Eisner and current Sony chief Sir Howard Stringer. Brett Ratner arrives with his house guest Jean Pigozzi who is allowed to photograph everyone. Graydon greets people with wife Anna and Fran Lebowitz by his side. 



Ingrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch, Ron Meyer, Bryan Lourd Francesco Clemente with his twin boys and Tom Ford chat each other up. People watching include the pregnant Victoria and David Beckham with Lynn Wyatt, Liv Tyler, Vincent Gallo, Eva Longoria, Larry Gagosian and Shala Monroque, Ben Silverman, Debbie and Allen Grubman, Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer wearing her oversized cat glasses. 



Bruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast rehearsal. This is a special honor. There are metal barricades leading up to the credentials trailer. High-tech security includes photos and computer background checks. The only thing they don’t do is pat me down and ask for fingerprints. Once inside the Kodak Theater’s massive auditorium, I find a seat next to Bruce’s proud parents. I watch Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Screenplay. Josh later told me at The Night Before Party that their acting methods are completely opposite. Josh says he is a quick study and is very creative and comfortable ad-libbing. Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, needs to have every syllable printed out, which he studies with a dialect coach. Little wiggle room for jokes. Life size photos on large cardboard plaques are taped to each nominee’s chair. I try to memorize their location, so when I return Sunday I can quickly kiss them all.  



Back at the Beverly Hills hotel, I slip into my gorgeous black tulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a plunging neck line and put on my mother’s jewels. Jim Coleman takes me the Night Before Party in the hotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg’s, 9th Annual A-lister event benefiting The Motion Picture & Television Fund where they raise $6.5 million dollars in one night. I walk right into Valentino who gives me the once over and approves my outfit. I tell him and Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen’s new film, “Midnight in Paris” is opening the Cannes Film Festival and they must bring the yacht. Woody is also filming all summer in Rome and I am counting on them to entertain him.



Elton John and David Furnish join our conversation and of course we ask for intimate details about the new baby. Elton says this is the first time they have been away from him for more than a night and they are delirious with parenthood. I segway over to Amy Adams who mentions she also hates leaving her baby in the hotel room. I tell her she’s acted like a lady with all the attention showered on Melissa Leo and that someday soon she will win an Oscar because she consistently hands in amazing performances and everybody loves her. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg’s god-daughter Gwyneth Paltrow. Kate gushes as she talks about her two grandchildren from daughter Jessica. I have known Steven since “I Wanna Hold Your Hand”. In 1982, as a young publicist on “E.T.” I moved to California to work for him as one of his thirteen assistants. I now tell him I’m going to Broadway opening of “War Horse” with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to see his movie version. He is wildly excited about the film. I beg him to work on it. 



I meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new hair cut and her perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret is a half hour on the treadmill every day. Somehow I think that’s an understatement. I tell Jesse Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week. He was hiding under his hoodie and I knew not to bother him. He said innocently, “You should have said ‘Hello’. I always cover my head because I think my curls make me look like a girl”. 



The charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at various booths for cheap clothing, new iPads, make-up, chocolates, shampoo and a $50 dollar Arch gift card for free McDonalds hamburgers. A bargain is a bargain, rich people run around like lunatics, collecting gifts for their housekeepers. Among the shoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom’s Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine Taylor and Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchette, Susan and Robert Downey,Jr., and Debra and Hugh Jackman. 



Next stop is The Weinstein Company’s Pre-Oscar party at the Soho House, sponsored by MontBlanc, celebrating their new charity partnership and $1 million dollar donation to the Princess Grace Foundation-USA. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night parties where nominees spoofed their own films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. Grown men would dress as Anna Paquin and play the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award. 



There is social anxiety at the Soho House garage entrance. Guests patiently wait as super stars whisk by. A four hundred pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator until I spot Benny Medina. Once on, I see the radiant Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She graciously pretends to know me. Her manager, Benny Medina is kicking me. 



I slip into Colin Firth’s booth by the front bar to have a tete-a-tete with him and his wife Livia Giuggioli about tomorrow night. Jokingly, I suggest when he wins to say, “I’m speechless”. Colin patiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, have already mentioned this. He then says that others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, assuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older models as Ford only designs classics. I tell him I made director Charles Ferguson, front runner for the financial documentary “Inside Job” spend $6,000 dollars last week for a new Tom Ford tuxedo. 



In the back room Jennifer Lopez is now seated with Weinstein’s wife Georgina Chapman. Nominee Helena Bonham Carter, her husband Tim Burton and her mother Elena circulate. Celebs have now drifted over from The Night Before Party. The star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, Camilla Belle, Chace Crawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren Aronofsky, Emma Stone, Jaime Foxx, director John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers Morgan, Rachel Zoe, Russell Simmons, Sean Parker, Sir Ben Kingsly, Zack Braff , Michelle Williams and Leonardo Dicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. “Speech” filmmakers are functioning on high anxiety.  



Sunday, February 27th, 2011



Producer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater at 3:00pm and nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we arrive at the world’s most famous red carpet, I guide Donna through the extreme right security check-in to make sure we mingle with the nominees and get on camera. I teach her the red carpet hustle which is five steps forward, three steps back and one inch behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Bryan Lourd as Sandra Bullock is talking to ABC-TV and a billion people see me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three steps back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow. As I hook up the back of her dress another billion people see us correcting a fashion malfunction. Once again, five steps forward and three steps back. We are now posing for the still cameras between Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Our handbags begin buzzing. Countless friends are e-mailing us that they just saw us on television. 



James Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip and energetic hosts. The film montages are always the best and the set looks great. This is the year of no surprises. Sorkin, Seidler, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, Natalie Portman and Colin Firth are totally prepared to receive the gold. Tom Hooper’s win leads into Best Picture. Harvey is now sitting in Spielberg’s seats as Spielberg announces the win. Six months of grueling work have finally paid off. King George VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a single man who triumphs over adversity. 



The Governor’s ball, held above the Kodak Theater, recreates the Mocambo-Ciro’s niteries of the 1930’s and 40’s, using a palette of teal and white. Three bands alternate musical styles as hungry guests wolf down Wolfgang Puck’s delicious food. The winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy eight pound gold statues. 



An hour later there is a migration to the famous Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at the Sunset Tower Hotel owned by Jeff Klein. One celebrity after another poses in front of the green hedge standing in the middle of the circular Vanity Fair logo to record their devotion and support to Graydon and the magazine. 



There’s a hierarchy of arrival times. The inner circle of Graydon’s 150 best friends attend a seated dinner and viewing of the show at 5pm. They include Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Tom Ford, Sandy Gallin, Mitch Glazer and Kelly Lynch, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, Naomi Watts and Live Schreiber, Wendi Stark, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, George Hammilton, Donna Karan and Steve Martin. 



The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9pm. They are Justin Bieber and his date Selena Gomez, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Vera Farmiga, Armie Hammer, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Spacey, Charlize Theron, Anne Hathaway, Hailee Steinfield,Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Michelle Williams, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Jane Fonda after her play, “33 Variations”, Melania and Donald Trump whom I introduce to David O. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about “The Fighter”. Donald offers me a ride home on his plane. He is leaving in ten minutes. Too bad James Franco didn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after party. Social standings of the rest of the guests are determined by half hour increments. Every other person previously mentioned in the story is here. VF’s Beth Kseniak and Matt Ullian tell me the list is cut down to 800 this year. 



At 11:30pm there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house. One should note that earlier in the evening Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risqué outfit with daughter Lourdes in front of the green hedge. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the crème de la crème with the promise of fabulous music, dancing and no cameras. Those reported on their dance floor include Ryan Phillippe with Amanda Syedfried, who were making out all night and Phillippe’s ex-wife Reese Witherspoon and new fiancé Jim Toth. They pregnant Natalie Portman and choreographer Benjamin Millepied, Mick Jagger, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Ralph Feinnes, Mila Kunis, Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow and Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper boogie til dawn.  



A winner’s work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper and David Seidler show up at 4:30am at The Four Seasons Hotel for a live broadcast on The Today Show with Meredith Vieira. Functioning on an adrenalin rush, they are back at the Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah’s live broadcast. Leave it to Oprah to get the king’s last words.

"
IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031481.txt,"Since the failed coup that led to the deaths of 271 people, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused
the imam, Fethullah Gulen, of issuing instructions to launch the coup, a charge Mr. Gulen has denied.

Turkish authorities have demanded the U.S. extradite Mr. Gulen immediately to Turkey, but The Wall Street
Journal reported Thursday that U.S. officials don't expect to do that, citing people familiar with the discussions.

US. officials see problems with the evidence presented thus far by Turkey, and they are concerned

about strident public statements made by Turkish leaders against Mr. Gulen, those people said.

Mr. Erdogan has called Mr. Gulen and his supporters a terrorist network, a charge U.S. officials have long
discounted. Turkey in May officially designated Mr. Gulen’s network a terrorist organization, making

membership a crime under Turkish law.

Mr. Erdogan’s government has pressed the Obama administration since the coup to extradite Mr. Gulen,
arguing that pursuing the imam is part of the broader campaign against terrorism. At times, the Turkish leader’s
aides have said Ankara would view as hostile any foreign government that gave sanctuary to leaders of the

Gulen movement.

Turkey hasn't yet made a formal extradition request to the U.S., and Turkish officials say they plan to provide

more evidence to the Justice Department.
Mr. Gulen, 75 years old, came to the U.S. in 1999, and has a devoted following in Turkey and other countries.

At a press conference in Washington on Friday, Mr. Gulen’s lawyers said they have spoken to the Justice

Department about the demands for extradition but are unaware of the U.S. government’s thinking or plans.

Asked if they feared for his life, one of Mr. Gulen’s lawyers, Reid Weingarten said, “We do. We’re very
concemed about his safety.’? The lawyer said they are discussing whether to ask U.S. authorities for help in

safeguarding their client.

A Turkish court has issued a warrant for Mr. Gulen’s arrest, and Turkish and U.S. authorities have privately
discussed scenarios in which Mr. Gulen might be extradited. But several U.S. officials said they cannot now

envision a scenario in which they turn him over to Turkey.

“Tt would be unprecedented and appalling if the U.S. took a frail, almost octogenarian, plopped him on a plane
to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him by the entire Turkish

government,’’ said Mr. Weingarten.

island, when Secret Service records proved they were never even
there.

Dershowitz said Roberts’ allegations were part of an extortion plot,
and that she “should be seriously punished for submitting false
information and a false affidavit.”

The attorney emphasized that Roberts has not been willing to repeat
her allegations against him in public, and that she has only accused
him in the context of litigation, which affords certain protections.

*asenanis|wineeas” THREE COURSES £29.

“She simply hides behind litigation privileges,” Dershowitz said,
encouraging Ross to call Roberts and see if she would repeat her
claims. “And if she does, | will be in court the next day suing her for
defamation and | will win the case ‘cause | can prove conclusively
that she made up the whole story from top to bottom.”

Ross then turned to the controversial deal that Epstein received from
federal prosecutors who were investigating the trafficking case
against him. Federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute him, and let
him plead guilty to state charges that resulted in a 13-month prison
sentence that allowed Epstein to leave prison during the day for
work. Federal prosecutors allegedly did not even inform victims
before making the deal, which is now the subject of a request for an
Inspector General investigation. Congressional Democrats said ina
letter that they want to know more about the circumstances
surrounding the deal, which was made by then-U.S. Attorney and
current Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta.

As Epstein’s defense attorney in that case, Dershowitz is not upset
about it the deal at all.

“I’m very proud of that deal, that’s what lawyers are supposed to do,”
he said. “Lawyers are supposed to get the best deals they can.” If he
could have gotten 10 months or no time at all, that would have been
even better, he said.

Acosta said in the past that Epstein’s lawyers, including Dershowitz,
put pressure on his office by investigating his staff. Dershowitz has
denied this.

“Acosta was very tough,” Dershowitz said, contrary to concerns that
he did anything improper. Dershowitz pointed out that the problem
feds had was proving that girls were transported in interstate

commerce.

the: deposition of Tommy Mattola. That assertion is untrue. Mr. Mattola's deposition was set by
the law firm of Searcy Denny Scarola Barnhart and Shipley. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit ““N”
at 16.

74. Edwards gave notice that he intended to take David Copperfield's deposition.
Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so. Epstein’s housekeeper and one of the only
witnesses who did not appear for deposition with an Epstein bought attorney, Alfredo Rodriguez,
testified that David Copperfield was a guest at Epstein’s house on several occasions. His name
also appears frequently in the message pads confiscated from Epstein’s house. It has been
publicly reported that Copperfield himself has had allegations of sexual misconduct made against
hin by women claiming he sexually abused them, and one of Epstein’s sexual assault victims
also alleged that Copperfield had touched her in an improper sexual way while she was at
Epstein’s house. Mr. Copperfield likely has relevant information and deposition was reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at

75. Epstein also takes issue with Edwards identifying Bill Richardson as a possible
witness. Richardson was properly identified as a possible witness because Epstein’s personal
pilot testified to Richardson joining Epstein at Epstein’s New Mexico Ranch. There was
information indicating that Epstein had young girls at his ranch which, given the circumstances
of the case, raised the reasonable inference he was sexually abusing these girls as he had abused
girls in West Palm Haadh and elsewhere. Richardson had also returned campaign donations that

were given to him by Epstein, indicating that he believed that there was something about Epstein

DENMARK

This Memorandum has not been and will not be filed with or approved by the Danish Financial Supervisory
Authority or any other regulatory authority in Denmark and Limited Partner Interests in the Fund have not been and
are not intended to be listed on a Danish regulated market. Limited Partner Interests in the Fund have not been and
will not be offered in Denmark under the E.U. Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (as implemented
into Danish law). Consequently, this Memorandum may not be made available and interests in the Fund may not be
marketed or offered for sale directly or indirectly to any natural or legal person in Denmark except as permitted
under applicable rules.

FINLAND

As the Fund is a closed end fund, the marketing of interests in the Fund is not interpreted to be subject to the
provisions of the Finnish Act on Mutual Funds (sijoitusrahastolaki, 29.1.1999, as amended, the “MFA”). Accordingly
prospective investors should acknowledge that this Memorandum is not a fund prospectus as meant in the MFA and
the marketing of interests in the Fund is not subject to a marketing permission from the Financial Supervisory
Authority (Finanssivalvonta; “FIN-FSA”). Furthermore, even if interests in the Fund were to be construed as
“securities” as defined in the Finnish Securities Markets Act (arvopaperimarkkinalaki, 14.12.2012/746, as amended
the “SMA”), based on the exemptions set forth in the SMA, the offering of interests in the Fund would be exempted
from the prospectus requirements of the SMA (based on the limited number of Finnish offerees and the minimum
investment and transfer restrictions specified herein). Accordingly prospective investors must acknowledge that this
Memorandum is not a prospectus within the meaning set forth in the SMA. Prospective investors should also note
that neither the General Partner or the Management Company is an investment firm (sijoituspalveluyritys) within the
meaning of the Finnish Investment Services Act ( sijoituspalvelulaki 747/2012) and they are not subject to the
supervision of the FFSA. Any prospective investors should acknowledge that they will not be treated as clients of
placement agents (if any) engaged by the Management Company in connection with the placement of interests in the
Fund and such placement agents may not be under any duty to safeguard the interests of prospective investors.
Furthermore, the Fund is not a property fund as meant in the Finnish Act on Property Funds (kiinteistérahastolaki,
1173/1997). The FIN-FSA has not authorized any offering for the subscription of interests in the Fund; accordingly,
interests in the Fund may not be offered or sold in Finland or to residents thereof except as permitted by Finnish law.

It didn't help that he reacted very badly when I went after him aggressively -- too
aggressively, I knew, but couldn't help it -- and told him honestly how vulnerable I was.
He backed off fast, leaving me more confused than ever. (Though not too confused to
think: How stereotypical.)

It went beyond being a woman spurned, though. Especially since I believed,
intellectually, that he didn't owe it to me not to be busy. He wasn't required to sort me
out. And -- since it seemed to be what I was after -- he wasn't obligated to continue
hurting me. We'd just met, after all.

It was more that I was enraged by how desperately I wanted to be hurt -- and infuriated
that someone, anyone, could have such power over me. I had always thrown myself into
infatuations; like most people, I'd been known to get angry at the object of my affections.
But this was different. Not only was I infatuated, I was aching for something I couldn't
reconcile. Even if Richard had been the perfect counselor I had no right to expect, I might
have hated him. As it was, I felt toyed with, and found as many other reasons to dislike
him as I could. As long as I could focus on wrath, I didn't have to think about my other
feelings.

It kept me from falling apart.

He was away for most of the summer. I went to a few trusted friends for reassurance and
validation; giving few details, I allowed my anger to calcify. But Richard ended up
surprising me. On a visit to Chicago, he called me every night for a week. The bruises he
left took weeks to fade, some of them bleeding and leaving scars. I raged as I covered the
worst of them -- but felt also a low-burning fulfillment. One close friend, Andrew, caught
sight of a bruise on my leg and cast me a worried look. That looks pretty bad, he
observed, and I could only say, Yes.

By then, I'd well and truly internalized the belief that Richard didn't want to deal with
emotional vulnerability, and my furious resentment remained. This feeling was not
helped by society in general; men hate emotions, right? Still, the more time I spent with
him, the more I had to admit that he made an effort to be sensitive. Most of our failures to
understand each other came from how different our relationship paradigms were, not to
mention my unevenly-repressed identity crisis. I know I tried to warn Richard that I
wasn't doing well at expressing myself and that what I thought, or felt, or believed I was
might change on short notice; but I doubt I got even that concept across.

He identified fairly publicly as a BDSMer, and made it clear that he considered me
superficial and cowardly because I was unsure about doing so myself. He was also
polyamorous, a lifestyle that I had some experience with -- but though I respected others’
choices to engage in it, I'd decided against polyamory for myself. It felt strange to draw
the parallel, but it was somewhat like dealing with a difficult boyfriend. Still, I didn't
trust him, and our relationship didn't particularly involve sex.

Just pain.

Towards the end of one night, wan light filtering through my curtains, Richard inquired

clearly apply to victims. Illustrative of these decisions is the thoughtful analysis by the U.S. District Court for the District of
Nebraska in Bothwell v. Republic Tobacco Co. 3!? Bothwell presented four grounds for its holding that courts have inherent
power to appoint attorneys to represent indigent litigants:

1) courts possess the herent power to bring to their assistance those instruments necessary to ensure a fair and just
adjudicative process in individual cases; 2) in many, if not most, cases, due to the adversarial nature of our system, lawyers are
a necessary component in ensuring such a fair and just process; 3) to a significant degree, neither the private marketplace nor
public or charitable efforts provide indigent litigants with adequate access to legal assistance; and 4) to that extent, such failure
threatens the reliability of the results of the adversarial process. 313

These grounds readily apply to appointing attorneys for indigent victims when important rights under the CVRA are at stake.
Without [*914] an attorney to press her claims, a victim may be unable to obtain a fair and just adjudicative process. *!4
Moreover, crime victim representation appears to be a prime example of a situation where neither the private marketplace nor
public or charitable efforts provide indigent litigants with adequate access to legal assistance. 3!° No financial incentive will
drive lawyers to represent victims in criminal cases. *!© And while pro bono representation for victims is expanding, 7!” it still
falls far short of the needs of victims in the federal system. The fourth and final requirement - that the failure of attorneys to
represent the indigent client threatens the reliability of the system - is also present where rights under the CVRA are at stake.
Neither the prosecutor nor the defendant has a personal stake in the victim's rights, and, frequently, they will have other
priorities and interests that may even be adverse to the rights of the victim. *!* Accordingly, courts have inherent authority to
appoint counsel to represent indigent victims and, indeed, may even be able to require [*915] counsel to serve without
compensation. *!° The local rules of some federal courts already explicitly recognize this power. 37°

In addition to this inherent authority, federal courts appear to possess statutory authority to make such an appointment. Title 28
broadly permits the court in both civil and criminal cases to request an attorney to represent any person unable to afford
counsel. 3?! Moreover, at least one statute already directly authorizes federal courts to appoint counsel for child victims in

Compliance Program Case Study

Recent DOJ and SEC actions relating to a financial institution’s real estate transactions with a government agency
in China illustrate the benefits of implementing and enforcing a comprehensive risk-based compliance program. The
case involved a joint venture real estate investment in the Luwan District of Shanghai, China, between a U.S.-based
financial institution and a state-owned entity that functioned as the District’s real estate arm. The government entity
conducted the transactions through two special purpose vehicles (SPVs”), with the second SPV purchasing a 12%
stake in a real estate project.

The financial institution, through a robust compliance program, frequently trained its employees, imposed a
comprehensive payment-approval process designed to prevent bribery, and staffed a compliance department with
a direct reporting line to the board of directors. As appropriate given the industry, market, and size and structure of
the transactions, the financial institution (1) provided extensive FCPA training to the senior executive responsible for
the transactions and (2) conducted extensive due diligence on the transactions, the local government entity, and the
SPVs. Due diligence on the entity included reviewing Chinese government records; speaking with sources familiar
with the Shanghai real estate market; checking the government entity's payment records and credit references;
conducting an on-site visit and placing a pretextual telephone call to the entity’s offices; searching media sources;
and conducting background checks on the entity's principals. The financial institution vetted the SPVs by obtaining
a letter with designated bank account information from a Chinese official associated with the government entity (the
“Chinese Official”); using an international law firm to request and review 50 documents from the SPVs’ Canadian
attorney; interviewing the attorney; and interviewing the SPVs’ management.

Notwithstanding the financial institution’s robust compliance program and good faith enforcement of it, the
company failed to learn that the Chinese Official personally owned nearly 50% of the second SPV (and therefore a
nearly 6% stake in the joint venture) and that the SPV was used as a vehicle for corrupt payments. This failure was
due, in large part, to misrepresentations by the Chinese Official, the financial institution’s executive in charge of
the project, and the SPV’s attorney that the SPV was 100% owned and controlled by the government entity. DOJ
and SEC declined to take enforcement action against the financial institution, and its executive pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s internal control provisions and also settled with SEC.

compliance program and commitment to ethical and law-
ful business practices and, where appropriate, whether it
has sought assurances from third parties, through certifica-
tions and otherwise, of reciprocal commitments. These can

be meaningful ways to mitigate third-party risk.

Confidential Reporting and Internal Investigation
An effective compliance program should include a
mechanism for an organization’s employees and others to
report suspected or actual misconduct or violations of the
company’s policies on a confidential basis and without fear of
retaliation? Companies may employ, for example, anony-
mous hotlines or ombudsmen. Moreover, once an allegation

is made, companies should have in place an efficient, reliable,

and properly funded process for investigating the allegation
and documenting the company’s response, including any
disciplinary or remediation measures taken. Companies will
want to consider taking “lessons learned” from any reported
violations and the outcome of any resulting investigation to
update their internal controls and compliance program and

focus future training on such issues, as appropriate.

Continuous Improvement: Periodic Testing and
Review

Finally, a good compliance program should constantly
evolve. A company’s business changes over time, as do the
environments in which it operates, the nature of its custom-

ers, the laws that govern its actions, and the standards of its

° Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told —

° Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned “Lawrence Krauss for President.”
° In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that

religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe.

° You have stated that science provides answers to many of life’s biggest questions, and can even fix
great societal injustices.

° Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the
dearth of women and minorities in science. “Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias,” you
said. “It’s built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical
evidence.”

° You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail.

° Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently

° In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: “As a scientist | always judge things on empirical evidence and
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I’ve never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my
presumption is that whatever the problems were | would believe him over other people.”

° In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: “I remain skeptical, and | support a man
whose character | believe I know...If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.”

° You were made an honorary member of CFI’s board of directors in December 2011.

° A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post,
published at around the same time, described incident #5.

° The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault
were “potentially illegal.” The second post was quickly taken down.

TWENTY artists hailed as stars of the
future are getting the chance to show
their work alongside that of 60
masters, from Picasso and Warhol to
Manet, Rodin and Cézanne.

The 20 were chosen from hundreds
of graduate students in the New
Sensations Prize, a contest now in its
fourth year, organised by Charles
Saatchi’s gallery and Channel 4.

Their workis part of The House ofthe
Nobleman, an exhibition of art bor-
rowed from international collections
that is being staged in an 18th-century
mansion in Cornwall Terrace, Regent's
Park, a stone’s throw from the Frieze
Art Fair.

Four 6f the graduates were selected
to receive £1,000 bursaries to develop
a project for inclusion. They are: Ger-
man Pablo Wendel, 30, whose degree
work involved squatting in a derelict
chip shop to which he built a staircase,
later dismantled by Royal College of
Art staff in a health and safety row;

Rebecca Wilson, associate director
of the Saatchi Gallery, said: “The 20

shortlisted artists have created a
stunning range of work, including
photography, painting, installation and
sculpture. The exhibition offers a
wonderful opportunity to discover the
bright stars of the future.”

More than half of the graduate artists
are based in the capital. “London is still

one of the best places to do a fine art
degree and has that reputation across
the world, as well as being one of the
most vibrant centres for contemporary
art,” Ms Wilson added.

Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

the agent must rely on the data gathered from the sensors (there is no human in the loop to decide
this), there can be unexpected situations where the agent would stop some human interaction with
the system or interrupt maintenance activities, because it deemed that these actions could harm
the system. For example, the system administrator stopping some services during system
maintenance, or upgrading to a newer software version.

e Replication to third-party systems and collateral damage — Building on the first problem of the
agent not having the correct information. If the term friendly network gets misconfigured and the
agents have the capability to self-transfer to new friendly hosts, it can happen that the agent would
distribute to external networks, start defending it and take responsive actions on third party hosts.
Such incidents would make the agents very difficult to halt.

e Friendly fire — One agent might consider another agent as an adversary and start trying to
eliminate/evade each other.

e Silent compromise — If the adversary manages to get access or reverse engineer the agents
(without the agent self-destructing), they could potentially trick or reconfigure the agents to turn
on themselves.

CYBER-OFFENSE

Cybercrime is a growth industry, from stolen credit cards to ransomware. Very crudely, it's a two tier
system, with a spray and pray approach at the low-skill end that targets millions of system in the
hope some of them would be vulnerable (through technical or human failing); at the other end are
tailor-made attacks that rely on slow progression of escalation and compromise, often requiring
advanced technical skills for discovering zero-day vulnerabilities and intimate knowledge of the target.

Advanced artificial intelligence may be used to automate some or all of the components of
contemporary elite cybercrime, such that generic offensive toolkits could become available to small
criminal groups, leading to a world where individuals and companies do not feel safe and cannot trust
their governments and the police to protect them. At the same time significant wealth could be
accumulated by those groups unscrupulous enough to use such tools, transferring significant power to
those who put little value in the property rights of others. Such wealth and power could be used to
further develop cyber-offensive capabilities, leading to a positive-feedback loop that may outpace
similar feedback loops in less harmful industries, e.g. advertising or health where the great short- and
mid-term benefits of Al are expected.

PERSISTENT CYBERWARFARE?

Systems such as the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge promise adaptive software security that
automatically explores vulnerabilities and patches them in friendly systems, but also is able to exploit
them in opposing systems in “capture the flag” tournaments. As methods of developing such systems
improve, an arms race emerges between actors in the cybersecurity space, dominated by major nation
states eager to both improve their own resilience in a scalable way and finding choice zero day exploits
suitable for intelligence purposes, supported by national security concerns. Other actors such as
corporations and criminal networks also spend effort in building or copying such systems. Meanwhile

safe.

Why put such effort, worthy of the deepest physics problems, into the challenge of
sneaking into a cellphone undetected? Well, for Seaborn and Dullien, the drive was
part of a “discover and publish” effort to keep the overall system clean. It is better to
hack, discover and patch than to be hacked, and remain undiscovered. But these
“good guy” engineers are racing against different, equivalently sophisticated, less-
decently inspired teams. The development and sale of zero-day bugs is, after all, a
business. Modern versions of Cap’n Crunch whistles crack access to some of the
most essential financial, political and security data stores on the planet. As the
power and value of hacking targets has increased, so has the price of the exploits.
Public “zero day markets” sponsored by companies like Google and Microsoft pay
hundreds of thousands of dollars to researchers who discover holes in their
systems. “Better to find them ourselves,” the thinking goes. Though that does not
always make the embarrassment less acute when holes are spotted. At one of the
most carefully watched public hacking competitions in early 2015, for instance, a
skinny, smiling South Korean named Jung Hoon Lee took home $225,000 in prize
money by pwning a series of some of the most important, common programs on the
planet, Apple’s web browser Safari and Google’s Chrome among them. These
systems had been constructed at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. They‘d
been assembled under the gaze of some of the best PhD-led computer scientists in
the world. Jung Hoon Lee’s exploits ran through their complete defenses in less than
a minute. 144

As good and fast as someone like Lee might be, he’s nothing compared to what the
best hackers do. They don’t work in public or compete in hotel ballrooms. They
don’t brag. And they develop ideas that make $225,000 look like a bargain. These
successors to the Warez Dudes work for cybercriminal billionaires, for intelligence
agencies, and even (often) just for themselves. They help find and deploy the sorts of
really deep system exploits that enable brazen cyber thefts of millions of pieces of
personal data or attacks like the Stuxnet virus, which caused thousands of Iranian
nuclear centrifuges to vibrate themselves apart. And they do still more: Most of the
attacks we've talked about so far occur in installed, running boxes. But the
companies that make those boxes oversee a whole, vulnerable process of building
and testing and designing and installing them. And it’s here, with billion dollar
budgets at work, that some exploit teams make and leave vulnerabilities that they
can later, ruthlessly exploit. Every step of that gestation — from sneaking secrets into
early code bases to intercepting and rewiring routers as they ship overseas — is now
an opportunity for secret control. Or for unanticipated risk, for “emergent

same idea in next generation theory.

My 3.5% is a rough estimate. What counts is the generation length. The length was
probably higher, and the rate lower, before medicine and sanitation lowered
mortality rates, and let two or three births per couple meet the need for population

replenishment.

The cash flow or pure consumption rate modeled at 3.5% might also vary for
reasons other than changes in the generation length. My charts show the pure
consumption/total capital rate as higher in the middle part of the twentieth century
as people drained capital reserves to keep up consumption in times of world-wide

depression. I’ll say more about these reserves.

First Interpretation

Next generation theory says in effect that R. A. Fisher’s version of the generation
length, not Petty’s primogeniture version, gives the period of production of total
capital. We would miss the point if we focused on the period production of human
capital separately. Total capital is our means of lineage survival. This reinforces my
theme that human capital does not mean humans. It means skill sets priced at
present value of foreseen cash flow. Skill sets are not enough for lineage survival.
We also need things. We should not fall into the trap of surplus value theory, which
had been taught by communists for decades before Karl Marx joined their ranks, in
supposing that skills make things. It is only half the truth. Skills plus things make

skills plus things as the generations repeat.
Nor should we make the mistake of supposing that the generation length begins and
ends uniquely from birth to birth, so that the remaining period of production grows

shorter over adult life and the time discount rate steeper. The period of a cycle is the

same at any point. The young, simply by maturing, are already investing in their

in the multifamily space.

* Hiring bankers, even as team hiring on pause: On the hiring front, management
noted that although it does not expect to hire teams heading into year-end, it is
continuing to hire individual bankers (recently hired 4 to 5 lenders). Hiring will be
focused on C&l and specialty finance lenders. Management does not expect to hire
additional CRE lenders.

= Easing in regulatory environment could provide some relief on expense growth:
With regard to the potential for some easing of regulatory burden on the banks
{important here as SBNY approaches the $50bn asset threshold) under the
incoming Trump administration management noted that it could see some
abatement in expense growth associated with compliance costs. However,
management is running the business based on the current regulatory framework
and will look for more tangible signs before it makes any changes to investment
decision, especially as it relates to the compliance infrastructure.

= Lending rates reflecting the steepening in the yield curve: SBNY noted that it
had raised rates on its 5-year fixed by 0.125% to 3.5%- 3.625% and 7-year fixed up
by 0.25% to 4.0%-4.125% following the steepening in the yield curve over the last
week. We note that this was echoed by SBNY’s NY rival NYCB which also noted
increasing rates on lending products in the aftermath of the move higher in interest
rates. We believe higher rates associated with new loans and better reinvestment
opportunities in the securities portfolio should serve as a tailwind to the margin
even as funding costs will likely trend higher, especially as the Fed raises interest
rates by 25bp in December.

= Regulatory scrutiny on multifamily lending manageable: With regard to the
heightened regulatory concerns surrounding CRE multifamily lending (multifamily is
50% of SBNY’s loan book), management noted that it has implemented a new loan
system likely coming on line in 3Q17 which should allow the bank to analyze the
loan portfolio at a more granular level. Management is also underwriting fewer
interest only multifamily loans in response to the regulatory concerns. Although, it
noted that it was not losing any significant business due to this as competitors had
also pulled back and borrower ability (in most instances) to service a non-interest
only loan.

Las Vegas has a larger supply of hotel rooms than any other metropolitan statistical area in the world and in return drives extraordinary
spending demographics. The vast majority of Las Vegas’ lodging supply is located on the Strip, and approximately 76% of all visitors (31
million) to Las Vegas stay in hotels on the Strip each year. Luxurious mega-resorts as well as more moderately priced accommodations are
concentrated on the Strip and in the immediate surrounding area to meet the needs of all segments of the visitor market. A comparable

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011094.txt,"Risk-averse clients in the omnibus fund can take short legs, and risk-tolerant ones
long legs. Management of the omnibus fund can handle the mechanics of the swaps

or futures.

The effect would be not less leverage per se, since leverage at the individual account
level is substituted for leverage at the corporate level. The difference is duration.
Swaps and futures are short-term commitments. Three months is typical. Futures
trade in active markets, for good measure, and can usually be liquidated in seconds

at current market during trading hours. So can ETFs themselves.
What do these derivatives cost? Essentially nothing. Those who prefer safety and
the short leg are matched with those who prefer return and the long leg, while the

manager charges only for its time in working the mechanics.

What About Asset Allocation?

Where the omnibus fund seems to violate common sense is in merging out what had
seemed to be valuable distinctions. So it would seem with the blending of equity and
debt claims, but for an optional overlay of derivatives such as futures to restore
whatever risk and expected return we want. Many distinctions blended out,
including that one, have been important to principles of asset allocation and modern
portfolio theory. They are important because some investment sectors are less
correlated than others, meaning less likely to risk and fall in lockstep. Low-
correlation portfolios are better because less volatile as a whole without sacrifice of
return. That’s why hedge funds typically assemble portfolios judged low or negative
in correlation, and then try to reduce correlation still further with an overlay of

derivatives. The omnibus fund seems to throw away all these options.

Not really. One of the lessons of the 2008 crash is that everything but Treasuries
tends to go down in high winds. Anti-correlation strategies failed when we most
needed them. The omnibus fund isn’t really giving up so much. Its exceptional

diversity makes it begin with less correlation than specializing portfolios. And

rate which is likely to be 6-7% through 2021 and in the mid-teens through 2025
after that. However, it would impact GAAP EPS and a lower corporate tax rate

Presenting from AB was Peter Kraus, Chairman & CEO. Peter expects AB to
generate above average organic growth and hopes to accelerate it given its product
mix and mostly favorable investment performance. In addition, he sees the potential
for new pricing in the industry, and does not expect a significant change in the DOL
impact from the election or a lower corporate tax rate on their tax rate.

e When asked what would get you more interested in AB’s stock, 55% of investors
said they wanted to see consistent positive organic growth, 18% said a better
operating margin, another 18% said diversification from fixed income flows (i.e.
equity and alternative flows), and only 9% of investors wanted to see a simplified

« AB has seen and expects to continue to see above average organic growth (ex 3Q
which was weighed down by lumpy institutional outflows) given a relatively new
and attractive product set, strong investment performance (notable improvement in
recent years), better traction with the consultant community, and opportunities to
gain in the retail and private wealth channels.

¢ Regarding potential changes post the election, AB had a similar tone to other asset
managers on DOL, in the sense that it likely gets delayed/modestly modified, but
regardless of what happens, asset managers and distributors need to accept that
the industry is living in a new fiduciary world with minimized (potentially no)
conflicts of interest which ultimately is a good thing for end clients. A lower
potential corporate tax rate would not likely benefit AB given its tax structure/low
current tax rate.

"
IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021351.txt,"anthropomorphism to fresh possibilities
for interpretation that are especially
important for understanding its role in
the human spiritual traditions in
modernity, as well as the controversies
surrounding that role. This research
proposes that a single set of
psychological mechanisms is likely to
explain when people perceive a mind at
work in an encountered phenomenon,
regardless of whether the thing in
question is a god, a machine, an animal,
another person, or an uncanny sequence
of events. From this perspective, the
psychological process of
anthropomorphic inference works in
concert with two other motivational
mechanisms: the need to interact
effectively with nonhuman phenomena
in our environment and the desire to
establish social connections with other
humans.” The phrase anthropomorphic
inference fails to capture, however, the
interactive dynamism that infuses a
person’s perception that a mind is at
work in another agent. Put more
strongly, our sense that mind is present
in the other is, in no small measure, the
sense that we are communicating. The
absence of this communicative
dimension of mind perception is
precisely the tragedy in the family of an
Alzheimer’s patient—the loss of
reciprocal recognition. As Tanya
Luhrmann vividly illustrates in the next
chapter, religious anthropomorphism
builds on the notion that this
communicative reciprocity extends
beyond the boundary of human society
into the wider environment and includes
social connection and communication
with the divine.

Anthropomorphism adds an
obvious but important twist to these
psychological mechanisms: whenever a
person ascribes human attributes to a

Page |105

nonhuman phenomenon, the person
nonetheless continues to perceive it as
nonhuman. When, for instance, a pet
owner observes a dog’s reliability and
infers that this behavior arises from the
dog’s faithfulness, the owner does not go
on to say that the dog is human. Indeed,
an indispensable aspect of an
anthropomorphic way of seeing Fido’s
faithfulness is that the person also
continues to see Fido as a dog. This dual
perception is even more pronounced in a
parallel illustration: a person observes
the everyday reliability of gravity and
infers that this arises from faithfulness at
the heart of the natural order. Both
illustrations indicate a close connection
of anthropomorphism to metaphor, in
which persons understand one kind of
thing in terms of another by identifying a
feature that bridges their difference
without eliminating it. The specific
feature, in this case faithfulness, posits a
point of comparison that enables a
familiar human capacity for loyalty to
enable interpretation of another,
unfamiliar or alien phenomenon. The
illustrations further suggest that Fido’s
faithfulness is what could be called weak
anthropomorphism, because one could
plausibly argue that dogs and humans
actually do share a capacity for
faithfulness. We perceive that, as
mammals, they exhibit many behavioral
similarities. By contrast, the perception
of faithfulness as an attribute of the
natural order is strong
anthropomorphism, because it makes a
far more daring inference in its effort to
draw an analogy that produces insight or
knowledge about the communicative
reciprocity of the human and the
nonhuman. Religions, as Edwards’s
sermon illustrates, build primarily on
strong anthropomorphism in order to
propound communicative social

groups, such as labor, anti-abortion activists or regional separatists, relied on
decades-old organizations. 15M - like Occupy Wall Street or pieces of the Arab
Spring or Al-Qaeda - relied on groups fresh-born into a hollow, worried political
vacuum. A survey of 15M members looked like a review of new Internet companies:
Young, wired, vividly unplugged from history and impossible to understand without
their constant connection. They were built by leaching people away from traditional
parties, the appeal was both the potential of the new and the chance to get away
from the rotting smell of old politics, surely an instinct many of us feel now.!24 This
is one reason it’s wrong to look at the world and consider it filled merely with
random events, with Black Swans. In fact, regularities and patterns appear many
places on the mesh of connection that surrounds us. They can be searched and
mapped and studied with the tools of data science, but of course they can also be
felt. They may surprise you if you don’t know how to look for them. But the
regularities are there. Human history is not only made of earthquakes.

Even if it can’t be predicted, complexity in any system, whether it is an Indonesian
coral reef or a Russian computer network, can at least be measured. How many
points are connected? How quickly and deeply do they interact? It is the
multiplication of connection that produces a complex landscape. There won't be
much emergence in a desert, for instance. You alone, unconnected: one point. You
online: Several billion. The essential benefit of many points connected in real time is
that they are an extremely fast feedback loop. This fine-tuning of action-reaction
forces them to adapt and adjust quickly, as if they were runners with a coach
constantly at their side. Compare the feedback loop of a marching Cairo street
protest to, say, the feedback loop of the old men around Mubarak. One was capable
of grabbing a new techniques and ideas in real time. The other stuck in a molasses
haze of old, sweet, slowing ideas. Faced with rapid change, a fast-adapting system
will nearly always perform a slow one.

When we say that networks can and will devour hierarchies this is one reason. All
the businesses that have been devoured by technology firms in recent years failed to
adjust fast enough. Network systems are more complex, their “org charts” are an
unnerving mess as a result of their speed. But under the mess is efficiency, growth,
innovation. Such systems can tip into failure easily, of course. But they also can
adjust their fitness before it is too late. The design of such systems becomes, then, a
matter of decisive power. And most of our essential systems now are designed fora
slower age. Refiguring the global financial system for an age of instant linkage was
one of the crucial conceptual puzzles of the 2008 crisis. Have we done that yet for
our taxes? Our voting? Our biological security? The chaos of those few weeks in the
markets in 2008 revealed new geographies of finance and speed, a mechanism that
had been wired to produce fortune for a few and to inspire, as a result, regulatory

129 million editions (Ref. $1). The country of publication is known for 85.3% of these editions, authors for
87.8%, publication dates for 92.6%, and the language for 91.6%. Of the 15 million books scanned, the
country of publication is known for 91.5%, authors for 92.1%, publication dates for 95.1%, and the
language for 98.6%.

I.2. Digitization

We describe the way books are scanned and digitized. For publisher-provided books, Google removes
the spines and scans the pages with industrial sheet-fed scanners. For library-provided books, Google
uses custom-built scanning stations designed to impose only as much wear on the book as would result
from someone reading the book. As the pages are turned, stereo cameras overhead photograph each
page, as shown in Figure $1.

One crucial difference between sheet-fed scanners and the stereo scanning process is the flatness of the
page as the image is captured. In sheet-fed scanning, the page is kept flat, similar to conventional flatbed
scanners. With stereo scanning, the book is cradled at an angle that minimizes stress on the spine of the
book (this angle is not shown in Figure $1). Though less damaging to the book, a disadvantage of the
latter approach is that it results in a page that is curved relative to the plane of the camera. The curvature
changes every time a page is turned, for several reasons: the attachment point of the page in the spine
differs, the two stacks of pages change in thickness, and the tension with which the book is held open
may vary. Thicker books have more page curvature and more variation in curvature.

This curvature is measured by projecting a fixed infrared pattern onto each page of the book,
subsequently captured by cameras. When the image is later processed, this pattern is used to identify the
location of the spine and to determine the curvature of the page. Using this curvature information, the
scanned image of each page is digitally resampled so that the results correspond as closely as possible
to the results of sheet-fed scanning. The raw images are also digitally cropped, cleaned, and contrast
enhanced. Blurred pages are automatically detected and rescanned. Details of this approach can be
found in U.S. Patents 7463772 and 7508978; sample results are shown in Figure $2.

Finally, blocks of text are identified and optical character recognition (OCR) is used to convert those
images into digital characters and words, in an approach described elsewhere (Ref. $2). The difficulty of
applying conventional OCR techniques to Google’s scanning effort is compounded because of variations
in language, font, size, paper quality, and the physical condition of the books being scanned.
Nevertheless, Google estimates that over 98% of words are correctly digitized for modern English books.
After OCR, initial and trailing punctuation is stripped and word fragments split by hyphens are joined,
yielding a stream of words suitable for subsequent indexing.

1.3. Structure Extraction

After the book has been scanned and digitized, the components of the scanned material are classified
into various types. For instance, individual pages are scanned in order to identify which pages comprise
the authored content of the book, as opposed to the pages which comprise frontmatter and backmatter,
such as copyright pages, tables of contents, index pages, etc. Within each page, we also identify
repeated structural elements, such as headers, footers, and page numbers.

Using OCR results from the frontmatter and backmatter, we automatically extract author names, titles,
ISBNs, and other identifying information. This information is used to confirm that the correct consensus
record has been associated with the scanned text.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024106.txt,"Methodology Used to Calculate Net Returns Numbers for Sprout Healthcare Technology
Portfolios

Estimated net returns numbers for the managed healthcare portfolio of the Sprout funds are
based on New Leaf’s calculations of synthetic net returns. The synthetic net returns for the
healthcare technology investments in each Sprout Fund are an estimate of what the net returns
would have been for these investments, if they had been managed in a standalone healthcare
technology venture capital fund structure rather than one set of investments as part of a larger,
diversified venture capital fund. The synthetic net returns were computed assuming a fund
size required to fund 100% of the total cost of the healthcare investments in each of the Sprout
funds using both called and recycled capital, a management fee of 2% payable quarterly and a
carried interest. The net return reflects reinvestment of certain proceeds, gains and other
proceeds by the Sprout healthcare portfolio synthetic funds to the extent permitted under the
partnership governing documents. A detailed example of the calculation is below.

Sprout IX: Total actual HCT investments of $740M; 2% management fees,
resulting in $120M of management fees and expenses from inception-to-date;
25% carried interest; Standalone fund size of $690M ($735M investments with
cash recycling of 6%); Total realizations have been $1,375M and total remaining
value is $50M. Assumes $130M in total carried interest to GPs already paid out;
Yields Total Distributed to LPs of $1,075M ($1,375M - $120M fees - $130M carry -

fantasy.

Since he often talked on stage about his environment, and since
police cars and courtrooms had become his environment, the content of

not to believe what she was telling him. “Daddy,” she said, “you'd

himself in the phone book under a pseudonym. He rarely attends society gatherings or weddings
or funerals; he considers eating in restaurants like “eating on the subway”—1.e., something he’d
never do. There are many women in his life, mostly young, but there is no one of them to whom
he has been able to commit. He describes his most public companion of the last decade,
Ghislaine Maxwell, 41, the daughter of the late, disgraced media baron Robert Maxwell, as
simply his “best friend.” He says she is not on his payroll, but she seems to organize much of his
life—recently she was making telephone inquiries to find a California-based yoga instructor for
him. (Epstein is still close to his two other long-term girlfriends, Paula Heil Fisher, a former
associate of his at the brokerage firm Bear Stearns and now an opera producer, and Eva
Andersson Dubin, a doctor and onetime model. He tells people that when a relationship is over
the girlfriend “moves up, not down,” to friendship status.)

Some of the businessmen who dine with him at his home—they include newspaper publisher
Mort Zuckerman, banker Louis Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, real-estate tycoon
Leon Black, former Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels), and
real-estate personality Donald Trump—sometimes seem not all that clear as to what he actually
does to earn his millions. Certainly, you won’t find Epstein’s transactions written about on
Bloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms. “The trading desks don’t seem to know him. It’s
unusual for animals shat big not to leave any footprints in the snow,” says a high-level
investment manager.

ADVERTISEMENT

Unlike such fund managers as George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose client lists and
stock maneuverings act as their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret, bar
one client: billionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chairman of Limited Brands. Epstein insists
that ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he has managed money only for billionaires—who
depend on him for discretion. “I was the only person crazy enough, or arrogant enough, or
misplaced enough, to make my limit a billion dollars or more,” he tells people freely. According
to him, the flat fees he receives from his clients, combined with his skill at playing the currency
markets “with very large sums of money,” have afforded him the lifestyle he enjoys today.

Why do billionaires choose him as their trustee? Because the problems of the mega-rich, he tells
people, are different from yours and mine, and his unique philosophy is central to understanding
those problems: “Very few people need any more money when they have a billion dollars. The
key is not to have it do harm more than anything else.... You don’t want to lose your money.”

He has likened his job to that of an architect—more specifically, one who specializes in
remodeling: “I always describe [a billionaire] as someone who started out in a small home and as
he became wealthier had add-ons. He added on another addition, he built a room over the garage
... until you have a house that is usually a mess.... It’s a large house that has been put together
over time where no one could foretell the financial future and their accompanying needs.”

He makes it sound as though his job combines the roles of real-estate agent, accountant, lawyer,

money manager, trustee, and confidant. But, as with Jay Gatsby, myths and rumor swirl around
Epstein.

Non-Prosecution Agreements

Under a non-prosecution agreement, or an NPA as
it is commonly known, DOJ maintains the right to file
charges but refrains from doing so to allow the company
to demonstrate its good conduct during the term of the
NPA. Unlike a DPA, an NPA is not filed with a court but is
instead maintained by the parties. In circumstances where
an NPA is with a company for FCPA-related offenses, it is
made available to the public through DOJ’s website. The
requirements of an NPA are similar to those of a DPA,
and generally require a waiver of the statute of limitations,
ongoing cooperation, admission of the material facts, and
compliance and remediation commitments, in addition to
payment of a monetary penalty. If the company complies
with the agreement throughout its term, DOJ does not file
criminal charges. If an individual complies with the terms
of his or her NPA, namely, truthful and complete coopera-
tion and continued law-abiding conduct, DOJ will not pur-

sue criminal charges.

Declinations
As discussed above, DOJ’s decision to bring or decline
to bring an enforcement action under the FCPA is made
pursuant to the Principles of Federal Prosecution, in the case
of individuals, and the Principles of Federal Prosecution
of Business Organizations, in the case of companies. As
described, in the case of individuals, the Principles of Federal
Prosecution advise prosecutors to weigh all relevant consid-
erations, including:
e federal law enforcement priorities;
e the nature and seriousness of the offense;
e the deterrent effect of prosecution;
e the person’s culpability in connection with the
offense;
e the person’s history of criminal activity;
e the person’s willingness to cooperate in the investi-
gation or prosecution of others; and
e the probable sentence or other consequences if the

person is convicted.”

The Principles of Federal Prosecution provide addi-
tional commentary about each of these factors. For
instance, they explain that prosecutors should take into
account federal law enforcement priorities because federal
law enforcement and judicial resources are not sufficient
to permit prosecution of every alleged offense over which
federal jurisdiction exists. The deterrent effect of prosecu-
tion should also be kept in mind because some offenses,
“although seemingly not of great importance by themselves,
if commonly committed would have a substantial cumula-
tive impact on the community?!

As discussed above, the Principles of Federal
Prosecution of Business Organizations require prosecutors to
consider nine factors when determining whether to prose-
cute a corporate entity foran FCPA violation, including the
nature and seriousness of the offense; the pervasiveness of
wrongdoing within the company; the company’s history of
similar conduct; the existence and effectiveness of the com-
pany’s pre-existing compliance program; and the adequacy
of remedies, such as civil or regulatory enforcement actions.

Pursuant to these guidelines, DOJ has declined to
prosecute both individuals and corporate entities in numer-
ous cases based on the particular facts and circumstances
presented in those matters, taking into account the avail-
able evidence.*** To protect the privacy rights and other
interests of the uncharged and other potentially interested
parties, DOJ has a long-standing policy not to provide,
without the party’s consent, non-public information on
matters it has declined to prosecute. To put DOJ’s declina-
tions in context, however, in the past two years alone, DOJ
has declined several dozen cases against companies where
potential FCPA violations were alleged.

As mentioned above, there are rare occasions in
which, in conjunction with the public filing of charges
against an individual, it is appropriate to disclose that a
company is not also being prosecuted. That was done in a
recent case where a former employee was charged but the

former corporate employer was not?

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028524.txt,"From: Jeffrey Epstein [jeevacation@gmail.com] 
Sent: 3/24/2014 7:06:50 AM 
To: soon yi previ 
When I was 8 years old, I watched my trial-lawyer father play Horace Vandergelder in the Livingston, N.J., 
community-theater production of Hello, Dolly! He entered wearing an enormous marching-band bass drum 
(the character is in a parade), and he roared to his sobbing niece, Dammit! How am I supposed to play 
'Yonkers My Yonkers' with all that bellowing in my ears! It was the most exciting thing I had ever seen. 
I was a melancholic child. Worried, anxious. I never felt as if I belonged anywhere, as if I were a foreign 
exchange student living among the other kids, who seemed predestined to love sports. Add to that alienation the 
fact that my parents were going through a divorce, and I was truly treading water. But in that junior high school 
auditorium, I felt like I'd discovered a secret I didn't even know was being whispered. There was a place where 
I might belong: It was the Theater, and I was sold. 
A few years later, at Stagedoor Manor in Loch Sheldrake, N.Y., I joined an intensive theater boot camp for kids 
just like me. The second I stepped off the bus, I felt like baby Simba when he's lifted into the air in The Lion 
King and all the animals sing. Everyone was affectionate; everyone hugged; no was called gay for doing 
anything that wasn't masculine. (My insecurity about this had shamefully kept me from doing theater in 
school.) It was utopia, and I never wanted to leave.

Krulwich/The New York Times 
It was there I met Michael Larsen, the musical director of the camp. He told me that I wasn't just a camper 
having fun, but that I also had talent. And he was tough — sometimes he'd scream at me — but I knew it was 
because he thought I had a shot. (Michael was the first of many gay men instrumental in guiding me to where I 
am now, which is why I try to speak on behalf of gay rights whenever I can. But I suppose that's a different 
essay.) 
At 18, I was cast as Woody Allen and Diane Keaton's son in the film Manhattan Murder Mystery, my first 
movie role. And now, after studying film and theater at Northwestern University, playing J. D. on Scrubs on 
TV for nine years and directing two films, I'm working with Woody Allen again. I'm typing these words in my 
dressing room at the St. James Theater, where on April 10 I'll open in Bullets Over Broadway, a musical 
adaptation of his hit film. I play David Shayne, a struggling writer in 1929 New York who agrees to cast a 
mobster's ditsy girlfriend in one of his plays in order to get it produced. 
The St. James is where Yul Brynner opened in The King and I in 1951; where hits like Oklahoma!, The 
Pajama Game, Gypsy, The Who's Tommy, and The Producers played, and where, in 1964, by the most 
surreal of coincidences, Carol Channing first descended an endless staircase in Hello, Dolly! I sit in Dressing 
Room 201, where many of the great luminaries of the Broadway stage — Patti LuPone, Nathan Lane, Mandy 
Patinkin — have paced waiting for the intercom to chime, Places for Act I, please. This is the sanctuary that a 
little invisible boy in New Jersey dreamed he'd one day find.

It's my first time on Broadway, but not my first time onstage. My first job straight out of college was in George 
C. Wolfe's production of Macbeth at the Public Theater, starring Alec Baldwin, Liev Schreiber, Angela 
Bassett and Michael C. Hall, and I've since appeared Off Broadway in shows at the Delacorte and Second Stage 
Theater.

The first day of rehearsal for Macbeth, Alec Baldwin sat down next to me. Who do you play? he asked. My 
voice quivered: Ummm, I play Fleance and Young Seward. He paused. Oh — so I kill you twice. Each 
night, as he drove his broadsword through my heart, I thought, I've made it! 
In the sixth season of Scrubs, the show's creator, Bill Lawrence (also a major fan of musical comedy), 
decided to do a musical episode. It was the first time I had done musical comedy since I was at camp, and it 
instantly reminded me how much I loved it. My favorite song from the episode was called Guy Love. In it, 
Donald Faison (my best friend in real life and on the show) and I sang about how our homoerotic love for each 
other was nothing to apologize for. (It's guy love, that's all it is.) The experience replanted the seed, and I 
made a promise to myself: One day I would sing on Broadway.

I'd be curled in the fetal position spooning a pillow right now, though, if it weren't for my current director, 
Susan Stroman. Directing and choreographing a musical is the most epic undertaking for one human being, yet 
Susan (or Stro, as the cool Broadway kids call her) handles it with aplomb. 
And she's not just choreographing the actors and dancers, but also the magnificent set designed by Santo 
Loquasto, which moves in ways I didn't know scenery could move. It's a dance of men and women and 
machines and winches and elevators and lights. The wings of the St. James are very narrow, so when a giant 
piece of scenery disappears from the audience's view, the most elaborate game of Tetris begins, as the 
outstanding stage crew turns and lifts and twists; not an inch is wasted. The second the orchestra strikes the first 
note of the overture, no one stops moving until the final curtain hits the deck. 
During Manhattan Murder Mystery, I had every word of my lines memorized down to the punctuation mark. 
I'll never forget: The first thing Woody said to me was, We're probably not going to say exactly what's on the 
page so ... you know ... just try to keep up. ... While we've been in previews on Bullets, he and Stro have 
been giving us notes each day on the previous night's performance. One night, I dropped a great joke by 
accident. He said to me with a smile, You'll probably get a bigger laugh if you actually say it onstage. 
All the people on Broadway are the best at what they do. All dancers want to work with Stro, so she gets the 
best dancers in New York City. Is there an oboist in the orchestra? You can guarantee he's the best oboist on the 
island of Manhattan. Need to recreate the look of 1929? The six-time Tony winner William Ivey Long is here to 
design the costumes. And the voices! I am in awe. There has yet to be a time when I don't get goose bumps 
when Betsy Wolfe, who plays my girlfriend, belts out the final notes of our duet, I Found a New Baby. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028525 
In TV and film, where I've had the bulk of my experience, the best moments of the day are edited together to 
create the best version of what you've captured. It's a different art, with a different process. But when the 
curtain rises at 8:05 every night at the St. James, the audience is being treated to a ballet of moving parts as 
intricate as a pocket watch. Whether it's the 19-piece orchestra under the stage, the crew in the wings or the 30 
performers on top of it, the gears turn, the set spins and a tiny hidden smile creeps across my face. 
Zach Braff is an actor, writer and director. His new film, Wish I Was Here, opens July 18.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017013.txt,"II. Construction of Historical N-grams Corpora

As noted in the paper text, we did not analyze the entire set of 15 million books digitized by Google.
Instead, we

1. Performed further filtering steps to select only a subset of books with highly accurate metadata.

2. Subdivided the books into ‘base corpora’ using such metadata fields as language, country of
publication, and subject.

3. For each base corpus, construct a massive numerical table that lists, for each n-gram (often a
word or phrase), how often it appears in the given base corpus in every single year between 1550
and 2008.

In this section, we will describe these three steps. These additional steps ensure high data quality, and
also make it possible to examine historical trends without violating the ‘fair use’ principle of copyright law:
our object of study is the frequency tables produced in step 3 (which are available as supplemental data),
and not the full-text of the books.

II.1. Additional filtering of books

IJ.1A. Accuracy of Date-of-Publication metadata

Accurate date-of-publication data is crucial component in the production of time-resolved n-grams data.
Because our study focused most centrally on the English language corpus, we decided to apply more
stringent inclusion criteria in order to make sure the accuracy of the date-of-publication data was as high
as possible.

We found that the lion's share of date-of-publication errors were due to so-called 'bound-withs' - single
volumes that contain multiple works, such as anthologies or collected works of a given author. Among
these bound-withs, the most inaccurately dated subclass were serial publications, such as journals and
periodicals. For instance, many journals had publication dates which were erroneously attributed to the
year in which the first issue of the journal had been published. These journals and serial publications also
represented a different aspect of culture than the books did. For these reasons, we decided to filter out all
serial publications to the extent possible. Our ‘Serial Killer’ algorithm removed serial publications by
looking for suggestive metadata entries, containing one or more of the following:

1. Serial-associated titles, containing such phrases as ‘Journal of, 'US Government report’, etc.

2. Serial-associated authors, such as those in which the author field is blank, too numerous, or
contains words such as 'committee’.

Note that the match is case-insensitive, and it must be to a complete word in the title; thus the filtering of
titles containing the word ‘digest’ does not lead to the removal of works with ‘digestion’ in the title. The
entire list of serial-associated title phrases and serial-associated author phrases is included as
supplemental data (Appendix). For English books, 29.4% of books were filtered using the ‘Serial Killer’,
with the title filter removing 2% and the author filter removing 27.4%. Foreign language corpora were
filtered in a similar fashion.

This filtering step markedly increased the accuracy of the metadata dates. We determined metadata
accuracy by examining 1000 filtered volumes distributed uniformly over time from 1801-2000 (5 per year).
An annotator with no knowledge of our study manually determined the date-of-publication. The annotator
was aware of the Google metadata dates during this process. We found that 5.8% of English books had

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018320.txt,"We said earlier that the Seventh Sense is tuned to spot the unsettling ripples that
come from this fact: Connection changes the nature of an object. Doctors and voters
and machines now sit, we’ve seen, on that stretched skin that links central and
distributed power. This changes the nature of these nodes. A connected doctor is
different than an unconnected one. Well, here is another insight we should know:
The simple, benign looking act of connection makes complicated objects into
complex ones. The moment an object clicks into a network, it is subject to all the
wildness of complexity that may lie there: cascades, whipping external forces,
unexpected internal faults revealed only under the pressure of connection. Cargo
packages. Shares of stock. Linked to a whole system of constant evolution, even the
most innocent looking point is subject to distant twitches, infections or liberating
innovations. They become, as a result, complex. That old lemma of parenting -
You’re only as happy as your least happy child - can be laid upon our devices. You're
as complex as the most complex device you're linked to.

Linkage to a complex network is like the difference between a boxed and a plugged-
in, turned-on blender: one is dormant, one is spinning with a wild and dangerous
energy. Connection can change the essence of a whole system if it is designed in
certain ways, as complex forces work on what looks stable. It can, for instance, take
once pliant, cooperative systems, people and tools and make them competitive.!4!
Jack an aspiring college graduate into a world where complex systems rip at his
finances, his data and his beliefs and you can end up with a crack in his values, a
move from aspiring middle class member to who knows what: nationalist, inventor,
communist, bitcoin banker. “I had no idea my doctor/aircraft carrier /phone/hedge
fund could do that!” is our common sort of surprise. Contagions, avalanches, tipping
points, feedback loops, infections - connectivity exposes us all to these forces.
“Everthing depends on everything else,” the mathemarical theorist Eugene Stanley
has observed of highly connected systems?!42. On networks that hover apart, isolated
from each other, small failures in one spot trigger limited damage?2?. But on highly
connected systems, tiny failures tumble around, breaking things.

Networks turn everything they touch from complicated to complex. Once a mesh of
connection is really flowing, it creates. Networks cause things to happen, in this
sense. New businesses, new fortunes, new ideas. Castell’s social protests emerged in
this way, appearing like condensate in the cooling jar of the post-2008 economic
crisis and then spreading, improving, evolving in scale and ambition faster than
most traditional politicians could track. Researchers following in his wake studied
the Spanish 15M demonstrations of 2011 and found it was composed largely of new,

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021350.txt,"nonhuman phenomena. In this way,
anthropomorphic language incorporates
human society in a web of ethical
obligations that connect to the natural
environment and, by imaginative
extension, to the universe as a whole.
Although the drive toward social
connection is a general human trait,
however, persons neither seek nor find
satisfaction in a generalized sense of
connection. Instead, satisfying social
connections are sought and experienced
in terms of the social norms and values
of particular historical and cultural
settings. Likewise, anthropomorphism,
as an inferred social connection to the
nonhuman, takes shape and becomes
persuasive in terms of historically and
culturally specific assumptions about
society and social relations. This
chapter will, therefore, step back from
“Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,”
in order to describe how contemporary
scholarship in social neuroscience and in
the history of religions provides a fresh
point of view on the workings of
anthropomorphic perception and then
test that interpretive model by
reappraising Edwards’s famous sermon
in its historical context.

The Boundary of the Human

The line between the human and
the nonhuman is, perhaps, the most
consequential presupposition that any
society, group, or individual adopts
about life in the world. The way various
cultures draw this line, between “us” and
“the other,” has shaped civilizations and
their goals as well as the norms of
personal conduct and identity. Although
concepts of the human have a long and
contentious philosophical history, people
in their everyday lives show remarkable
consensus in the features they use to
define “human.” Central to this process
of perceiving the human is a perception

of mind in other agents, including the
presence of goal-directed agency,
emotions such as anger, guilt, or pride, a
capacity for self-awareness, and free
will. As Nick Epley demonstrated in the
preceding chapter, the perception of
these distinctively human traits—“seeing
invisible minds”—1is a psychological
mechanism with tremendous influence
on the way humans order and understand
their social environment.

Mind perception is such a
powerful tool of inductive inference,
however, that it regularly crosses the line
it has itself drawn between the human
and the nonhuman. Scholars from a
wide array of disciplines have long
observed humans’ anthropomorphic
tendency to see nonhuman things or
events as humanlike, imbuing the real or
imagined behavior of nonhuman
phenomena with human motivations,
agency, and emotions. By perceiving
the world in terms of human capacities
and social relationships,
anthropomorphism builds a complex
system of analogies that uses knowledge
of what it is like to be a person, in order
to interpret the behavior of animals, the
function of technological devices, the
operation of complex social systems
such as “the market,” or natural
occurrences such as violent weather
patterns or catastrophic events.” Hence,
anthropomorphism, as a process of
inference that not only draws but also
crosses the line between the human and
the nonhuman, has very substantial
consequences for the human sense of
connection to nonhuman animals, to
larger ecological systems, and to the
structure of the universe taken as a
whole.

Contemporary psychological
research has created an intellectual space

market. Peter Kraus commented that there is a very strong philosophical argument
for the regulators to approve new fee structures which would allow investors to pay
alow beta fee and a higher performance fee for alpha generated (while it exists in
Europe, a similar structure is not available in the U.S.). While some in the industry
may not be fans to adapt such a structure, given challenging cost structure changes,
he thinks the product could be much more competitive relative to passive products.

¢ — If comprehensive tax reform includes an elimination of carried interest tax,
potentially moving to an ordinary income rate, it could have some impact to after
tax unitholder returns, but 80-90% of revenue comes from management fees and
much of the income already faces a corporate tax rate. It could make it more
attractive to shift to a C-corp. A change to the tax deductibility of interest expense
could have more far-reaching changes to the business, and to U.S.

« — Ares will always look to do tuck-in acquisitions, and has been doing almost one a
year. The pipeline of M&A opportunities continues to grow for ARES, given
demographics of principles with founders aging, and the environment becoming
harder to compete for small managers.

manipulating correlation further down with derivatives as hedge funds do.

Liquidity, Risk and Return

Demand deposits in banks today can be withdrawn at any time. Time deposits
cannot be attracted without either competitive interest or quick liquidity. This
liquidity requirement has been awkward in that bank deposits are usually reloaned
for years. Arun on the bank soon finds no cash left to meet withdrawals. The runs
come when the high winds blow, and provide a coup de grace on top of high default

rates.

The omnibus fund meets withdrawals easily because it is invested only in the most
liquid securities. ETFs trade in seconds at current market quotations. Any mutual

fund shares that might belong to the portfolio trade at current close.

Like most funds, the omnibus fund would also maintain cash. Like some others, it
would “equitize” its cash by exposing it to swaps or futures. Equitized cash leaves a
fund fully invested in effect, while adding instant liquidity around the clock. ETFs
give instant liquidity, but only during trading hours. Mutual funds typically trade at

market close only.

A risk-averse investor in the omnibus fund who opts for Libor plus so many basis
points is more or less in the same position as a bank depositor today. She knows
that her account will grow only by deposits and by interest (Libor plus basis points)
left in to compound. She knows that it will decline only by withdrawals. The investor
who prefers the long leg in swaps or futures, or stays unhedged, will also see her
account rise and fall with the market. There are infinite graduations around these
three simple choices. An account might be partly hedged and partly exposed, or
even over-exposed to a notional amount larger than the account size where law and

markets permit. (They usually do.)

affidavit from Epstein, to shore up her claims.

Still, Hafele gave Coleman extra time to respond to various motions that he will have
to decide before the case goes to trial.

Despite Scarola’s insistence that Edwards had nothing to do with Rothstein’s Ponzi
scheme, Coleman said the evidence indicates otherwise. Why else would he try to
depose Epstein’s well-known friends, such as now President Donald Trump, former
President Bill Clinton and illusionist David Copperfield, she asked. He used the
celebrities as a draw, she said.

“The Epstein cases were used to fleece money and defraud investors,” she said.

Edward’s malicious prosecution case has been difficult for both sides because both
Epstein and Edwards have refused to answer questions. As he did in the civil
lawsuits, Epstein has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination
when questioned by Scarola. Edwards has claimed that much of the information
Epstein is seeking is protected by attorney-client privilege.

The malicious prosecution lawsuit is one of two hotly-contested lawsuits that
continue to pit Edwards against Epstein. Edwards also is suing the U.S. attorney’s
office, claiming it violated the federal Crime Victims Rights Act when it negotiated a
non-prosecution agreement with Epstein.

Only after federal prosecutors agreed to drop their investigation of Epstein, did he
agree to plead guilty to two prostitution charges in Palm Beach County Circuit
Court. In federal court records, prosecutors claim one of the key reasons they agreed
to drop their case was Epstein’s agreement to settle lawsuits filed against him by
dozens of his underage victims.

Yes, we can expect more extremists to run under RCV. But also more centrists (e.g., Bloomberg). Since the 
centrists are closer to the median voter, they will defeat the extremists. 
The evidence I have seen suggests that RCV increases turn-out. [But it's important that voters be given the 
choice to rank as many or few candidates as they like, so that a voter always has the option of voting for a 
single candidate (in effect, he would be ranking all other candidates as tied for second). In practice, most voters 
choose to rank two or three candidates, but a significant fraction just rank one] 
In fact the increase in the diversity of candidates under RCV is related to turn-out. If RCV had been used in 
2016, Bernie Sanders could have run as an independent in the general election without fear of guaranteeing a 
Trump victory. Many of the Bernie supporters who stayed home on election day might then have voted---and 
presumably would have ranked Clinton second. This would have given lier a victory over Trump in Michigan, 
Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania (and possibly elsewhere).

interesting theory. Voting rules may seem nerdy and dry, but they can make an enormous difference to actual 
politics 
The formal argument that RCV promotes centrism better than the current system (plurality rule) is 
straightforward. Suppose that most voters vote ideologically in the sense that the closer a candidate is to their 
own position on the left-right spectrum, the more like they are to vote for him. Then under majority rule (my 
favorite voting system)---in which voters rank candidates and the winner is the candidate who beats all other in 
pairwise comparisons----the winner will be the median voter's favorite candidate-----in other words, the most 
centrist candidate gets elected (this assumes that there are enough candidates running so that there is one who 
is reasonably close to the median voter). Now observe that RCV is in between majority rule and plurality rule, 
and so will promote centrism better than plurality rule. 
Best wishes, Eric

It was fun and interesting. 
I admire your friends determination. 
Are you serious about working on this? 
Has anyone done a full analysis of this and polarization. 
Seems like on one hand it might encourage Ralph Nader cuz he d get more first round votes and not elect 
George bush. This might be bad. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026510 
On other hand, gore would not have to move left to take Nader vote. 
If I like centrism is it clear that this is better. 
I get that it avoids arbitrary outcomes but assume that a tea party nut is as likely to elect a dem as a lefty is to 
elect et a republican. 
Anyway thanks for setting up. 
Btw I gave them 10,000.

jeffrey apparently paid for massages with sex... I believe him when he told me he had no idea the girls were 
underage, and I doubt that people normally are asked for or present a driver's license under such 
circumstances... Moreover, I also believe that Jeffrey is an easy target for those who want to take advantage 
of him... Moreover, I can say with great honesty that Jeffrey's time in prison led him to seriously examine 
his life in very positive ways and I don't believe in blanket condemnations of people. He served time for 
something that was determined was inappropriate. I honestly don't know who was the victim in this case. I 
fully expect that these masseuses knew what they were doing, and were not swayed to do anything with 
Jeffrey that they were not already doing. That is not to approve of the whole behavior, but lots of peopleI 
know and like have behavior I don't entirely approve of. I know it is not politically correct to say that, 
because in general this is a very sensitive issue and all other things being equal one should take the side of 
the young women. But all things are not equal in this case, from my point of view. It is a judgement call, 
and I will not turn my back on a good friend so easily.

Thanks for getting back to me. I was asking because I found the quote shocking . . . the evidence against 
Epstein is overwhelming and he's even pled guilty to paying for sex with a minor. It's in no way scientific or 
rational to assume that because you never saw him with an underage girl he must actually be innocent. It is 
possible for a person to be kind and generous with his friends but still a criminal paying for sex with 
underage girls in his private life. 
I'm going to write about the topic on Skepchick, and I'll include any additional statement you'd like if you

Dear Professor Krauss, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031075 
http://krauss.faculty.asu.edu 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics' Guide to the 
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the 
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein: 
http ://www.thedailyb east. com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-j effrey-
epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/  
Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge, says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I 
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would 
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, 
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it. 
Thanks, 
Rebecca Watson

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022576.txt,"RESOLUTIONS

What Are the Different Types of
Resolutions with DOJ?

Criminal Complaints, Informations, and Indictments

Charges against individuals and companies are
brought in three different ways under the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure: criminal complaints, criminal infor-
mations, and indictments.

DOJ may agree to resolve criminal FCPA mat-
ters against companies either through a declination or, in
appropriate cases, a negotiated resolution resulting in a plea
agreement, deferred prosecution agreement, or non-prose-
cution agreement. For individuals, a negotiated resolution
will generally take the form of a plea agreement, which may
include language regarding cooperation, or a non-prosecu-
tion cooperation agreement. When negotiated resolutions
cannot be reached with companies or individuals, the mat-

ter may proceed to trial.

Plea Agreements

Plea agreements—whether with companies or
individuals—are governed by Rule 11 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant gener-
ally admits to the facts supporting the charges, admits
guilt, and is convicted of the charged crimes when the

plea agreement is presented to and accepted by a court.

Resolutions

The plea agreement may jointly recommend a sentence
or fine, jointly recommend an analysis under the USS.
Sentencing Guidelines, or leave such items open for

argument at the time of sentencing.

Deferred Prosecution Agreements

Under a deferred prosecution agreement, or a DPA
as it is commonly known, DOJ files a charging document
with the court,” but it simultaneously requests that the
prosecution be deferred, that is, postponed for the pur-
pose of allowing the company to demonstrate its good
conduct. DPAs generally require a defendant to agree to
pay a monetary penalty, waive the statute of limitations,
cooperate with the government, admit the relevant facts,
and enter into certain compliance and remediation com-
mitments, potentially including a corporate compliance
monitor. DPAs describe the company’s conduct, coopera-
tion, and remediation, if any, and provide a calculation of
the penalty pursuant to the US. Sentencing Guidelines.
In addition to being publicly filed, DOJ places all of its
DPAs on its website. If the company successfully com-
pletes the term of the agreement (typically two or three
years), DOJ will then move to dismiss the filed charges. A
company’s successful completion of a DPA is not treated

as a criminal conviction.

http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303

Here are some of the hard facts about Epstein—ones that he doesn’t mind people knowing: He
grew up middle-class in Brooklyn. His father worked for the city’s parks department. His parents
viewed education as “the way out” for him and his younger brother, Mark, now working in real
estate. Jeffrey started to play the piano—for which he maintains a passion—at five, and he went
to Brooklyn’s Lafayette High School. He was good at mathematics, and in his early 20s he got a
job teaching physics and math at Dalton, the elite Manhattan private school. While there he
began tutoring the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace Greenberg and was friendly with a
daughter of Greenberg’s. Soon he went to Bear Stearns, where, under the mentorship of both
Greenberg and current Bear Stearns C.E.O. James Cayne, he did well enough to become a
limited partner—a rung beneath full partner. He abruptly departed in 1981 because, he has said,
he wanted to run his own business.

Thereafter the details recede into shadow. A few of the handful of current friends who have
known him since the early 1980s recall that he used to tell them he was a “bounty hunter,”
recovering lost or stolen money for the government or for very rich people. He has a license to
carry a firearm. For the last 15 years, he’s been running his business, J. Epstein & Co.

Since Leslie Wexner appeared in his life—Epstein has said this was in 1986; others say it was in
1989, at the earliest—he has gradually, in a way that has not generally made headlines, come to
be accepted by the Establishment. He’s a member of various commissions and councils: he is on
the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Academy of
Sciences, and the Institute of International Education.

His current fan club extends to Cayne, Henry Rosovsky, the former dean of Harvard’s Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, and Larry Summers, Harvard’s current president. Harvard law professor Alan
Dershowitz says, “I’m on my 20th book.... The only person outside of my immediate family that
I send drafts to is Jeffrey.” Real-estate developer and philanthropist Marshall Rose, who has
worked with Epstein on projects in New Albany, Ohio, for Wexner, says, “He digests and
decodes the information very rapidly, which is to me terrific because we have shorter meetings.”

Also on the list of admirers are former senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of distinguished
scientists, most of whom Epstein has helped fund in recent years. They include Nobel Prize
winners Gerald Edelman and Murray Gell-Mann, and mathematical biologist Martin Nowak.
When these men describe Epstein, they talk about “energy” and “curiosity,” as well as a love for
theoretical physics that they don’t ordinarily find in laymen. Gell-Mann rather sweetly mentions
that “there are always pretty ladies around” when he goes to dinner chez Epstein, and he’s under
the impression that Epstein’s clients include the Queen of England. Both Nowak and Dershowitz
were thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand of a man named “Andrew” in Epstein’s house.
“Andrew” turned out to be Prince Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit in the back of
Dershowitz’s law class.

Epstein gets annoyed when anyone suggests that Wexner “made him.” “I had really rich clients
before,” he has said. Yet he does not deny that he and Wexner have a special relationship.
Epstein sees it as a partnership of equals. “People have said it’s like we have one brain between
two of us: each has a side.”

PME+ Methodology

Public Market Equivalent (“PME+”) is used to compare the net performance of each of the
Sprout HC synthetic funds and NLV funds to the performance of a same size, hypothetical
investment in a fund that tracked a public market index. The investments in the hypothetical
public market index funds have identical cash inflow schedules and proportionately
comparable cash outflow schedules. The cash outflow schedules are set so that the remaining
equity value of the public equivalent fund is exactly equal to the remaining equity value of the
benchmarked private equity fund at the end of the benchmarking period. The analysis is
presented to illustrate the comparative returns a limited partner would have generated by
investing in the hypothetical public market index fund at the same time and in the same
amounts as had been invested in each of the NLV or Sprout (HC portion only) synthetic funds.
The NLV or Sprout HC funds are presented as net, which includes the impact of management
fees, expenses, and carried interest. The public market index funds do not have any impact of
fees or carried interest. A more detailed description of the PME+ methodology used is available

table.

° She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She
crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away.

Incident 5:

° This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your
female companion for sex in your cabin.

° At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged
CFI’s president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise,
however.

Incident 6:

° During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once
again.

° The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker.

° With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie.

° As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her
right breast.

° She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. “Don’t do that,” she said.

° BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College

of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your
hand in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses
have confirmed the complainant’s account of what happened.

° In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016
incident.

° On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting
appointments.

° Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But
neither university found against you.

° “Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate
the allegations,” Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her.

° Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State’s Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an
inquiry “did not find a violation of university policy.”

° In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university’s senior associate general
counsel, noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. “The
University did not find either communication to state a credible allegation,” Jewett wrote.

Miscellaneous facts:

° In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since.

° Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made

for improving and developing a company’s compliance pro-
gram, and rewards for ethics and compliance leadership.”
Some organizations, for example, have made adherence to
compliance a significant metric for management's bonuses so
that compliance becomes an integral part of management's
everyday concern. Beyond financial incentives, some compa-
nies have highlighted compliance within their organizations
by recognizing compliance professionals and internal audit
staff. Others have made working in the company’s compli-
ance organization a way to advance an employee’s career.

SEC, for instance, has encouraged companies to embrace

methods to incentivize ethical and lawful behavior:

[MlJake integrity, ethics and compliance part of the
promotion, compensation and evaluation processes
as well. For at the end of the day, the most effective
way to communicate that “doing the right thing” is a
priority, is to reward it. Conversely, if employees are
led to believe that, when it comes to compensation
and career advancement, all that counts is short-term
profitability, and that cutting ethical corners is an ac-
ceptable way of getting there, they'll perform to that
measure. To cite an example from a different walk
of life: a college football coach can be told that the
graduation rates of his players are what matters, but
he’ll know differently if the sole focus of his contract
extension talks or the decision to fire him is his win-

loss record. 77!

No matter what the disciplinary scheme or potential
incentives a company decides to adopt, DOJ and SEC will
consider whether they are fairly and consistently applied
across the organization. No executive should be above com-
pliance, no employee below compliance, and no person
within an organization deemed too valuable to be disci-
plined, if warranted. Rewarding good behavior and sanc-
tioning bad behavior reinforces a culture of compliance and

ethics throughout an organization.

Third-Party Due Diligence and Payments

DOJ’s and SEC’s FCPA enforcement actions dem-
onstrate that third parties, including agents, consultants,
and distributors, are commonly used to conceal the pay-

ment of bribes to foreign officials in international business

transactions. Risk-based due diligence is particularly impor-
tant with third parties and will also be considered by DOJ
and SEC in assessing the effectiveness of a company’s com-
pliance program.

Although the degree of appropriate due diligence
may vary based on industry, country, size and nature of the
transaction, and historical relationship with the third-party,
some guiding principles always apply.

First, as part of risk-based due diligence, companies
should understand the qualifications and associations of
its third-party partners, including its business reputation,
and relationship, if any, with foreign officials. The degree of
scrutiny should increase as red flags surface.

Second, companies should have an understanding of
the business rationale for including the third party in the
transaction. Among other things, the company should
understand the role of and need for the third party and
ensure that the contract terms specifically describe the ser-
vices to be performed. Additional considerations include
payment terms and how those payment terms compare to
typical terms in that industry and country, as well as the
timing of the third party’s introduction to the business.
Moreover, companies may want to confirm and document
that the third party is actually performing the work for
which it is being paid and that its compensation is com-
mensurate with the work being provided.

Third, companies should undertake some form of
ongoing monitoring of third-party relationships.*”* Where
appropriate, this may include updating due diligence peri-
odically, exercising audit rights, providing periodic train-
ing, and requesting annual compliance certifications by the
third party.

In addition to considering a company’s due dili-
gence on third parties, DOJ and SEC also assess whether

the company has informed third parties of the company’s

Over the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins and attempted negotiations, and
then, on December 2, the infamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students to
be arrested by some 600 instructors of a new course called Introductory Police Brutality. These

were from the lab notes student took.

There was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who—long after she had forgotten what some
professor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment—would
remember, with perhaps a twinge of frightened pride, learning from a fellow demonstrator that
if she planned to go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an act of practical feminine

foresight to remove the earrings from her pierced lobes in advance.

So, now in 2019, fighting over free speech has been happening heavily at Berkeley campus again.

certain cases. Title /8 U.S.C. 3509 provides, The court may appoint a guardian ad litem for a child who was a victim of, or a
witness to, a crime involving abuse or exploitation to protect the best interests of the child. Congress, however, has not yet
provided funding for this particular right. 37? Finally, in unusual circumstances where a crime victim may also face possible

criminal charges of his or her own, the Criminal Justice Act would authorize appointment of and payment for defense counsel.
323

Proposed Rule 44.1 would confirm the existing discretionary power of the courts to appoint volunteer counsel. The rule is
purely discretionary (the court may appoint counsel) and is limited to [*916] situations where the interests of justice require
appointment. The rule does not address payment for counsel, as this matter must be left to subsequent appropriations from
Congress. The court, however, can ask for volunteer counsel to assist victims on a pro bono basis.

There is reason to expect that some attorneys will volunteer. Not only are many attorneys willing to undertake pro bono
representation, but the CVRA itself authorizes millions of dollars in funding for victim representation around the country. The

authorization includes support for the National Crime Victims Law Institute at the Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and

Clark College to help establish eleven legal offices around the country representing crime victims. 324

Finally, it might be argued that it is unnecessary to address this subject in a rule because the court's inherent authority to
appoint counsel exists even without a rule. Both courts and victims, however, will find it useful to have this authority spelled
out in the criminal rules to eliminate any lingering doubt. In addition, the CVRA obliges prosecutors to eliminate any lingering
doubt in the event of any material conflict of interest between the prosecutor and the victim by advising the crime victim that
the crime victim can seek the advice of an attorney. 32° This requirement may frequently require prosecutors to help victims
obtain legal counsel. Accordingly, a separate rule on this subject is appropriate.

For all these reasons, the rules should be amended to recognize the court's authority to appoint volunteer counsel to represent a
crime victim.

[*917]

Rule 46 - Victims’ Right To Be Heard Regarding Defendant's Release from Custody

The Proposal:

Victims should be explicitly given the right to be heard regarding the defendant's release from custody as follows:

(k) Victims' Right To Be Heard. A victim has the right to be heard regarding any decision to release the defendant. The court
shall consider the views of victims in making any release decision, including such decisions in petty cases. In a case where the
court finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the right to be heard in open court, the
court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to facilitate hearing from representative victims.

The Rationale:

320 See, e.g., D. Utah Civ. R. 83-1.1(6)(3) (1997) (“Any attorney who is admitted to the bar of this court must agree, as a condition of such
admission, to engage in a reasonable level of pro bono work when requested to do so by the court.).

Magistrate Judges (March 19, 1991) (available from the Administrative Office).

323 See 18 U.S.C. 3006A(a)(1).

324 See 42 U.S.C. 10603(d) (2000); see also 150 Cong. Rec. $4266 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (noting appropriations

believe me when I first told him to let me up. And maybe something in me agreed that
such a response was incorrect.

Eventually, I got away. Stupidly, confused, I mentioned the incident to my boyfriend. Of
course he was furious; I had to calm him. For my part, it hadn't occurred to me to be mad.
That didn't feel as bizarre as it sounds -- on some level, I felt that the whole incident was
reasonable, even if it hadn't turned out to be what I wanted.

Not then. Not with him.

te OK ok

After I cried my heart out in his bed, Richard was very kind. He brought me a glass of
water and listened as I said a lot of bewildered things. When I finally ran down, it was

late; he invited me to sleep over, but didn't put the moves on me. The next morning, he
told me he had work to do. Straightforwardly, I asked when I could see him again. He

smiled, said to email him, that we'd work something out.

The next few days -- weeks -- time, I don't know; however long it was, it felt like being
put through a shredder. I couldn't think about anything but that night and how, through
my turmoil and tears, I'd found a kind of exultation. I had been sober, prepared and clear-
headed. I couldn't find a way around the brutal, uncompromising revelation that
apparently, I wanted nothing more than to be subordinated, used, hurt. I actually wanted
to be a victim.

I wanted to talk to someone, but wasn't sure how to frame my words. I was positive it
would help to talk to Richard, but he was busy, and busy, and busy. I had a number of
friends who I suspected were into hardcore BDSM; I could have called any of them. But
it was one thing to be fine with other people doing it, and quite another to discover such a
desire in myself. In another situation, I would have thoroughly deconstructed my obvious
double standard -- but just then, it was a minor irrationality on top of one big chunk of
insanity.

I considered asking my loving, liberal parents for advice and tried to imagine how it
would go.

Mom. Dad. I love you, and I'm so sorry. I know you've tried to give me an independent,
rational, feminist outlook, as well as self-esteem and integrity. Sadly, none of this
appears to have taken; I guess I'm a broken mockery of everything you tried to instill. I
don't want you to worry, or blame yourselves, but have you any advice on where to go
from here?

No.

ok oe
My mental images of that summer are hazy with remembered anger. As Richard
remained occupied, I felt fury building within my fascination. I'm sure I felt like the

classical woman spurned: he was nice enough when he ran into me and told me he was
there to talk if I needed it, but the evidence contradicted his words. For weeks after that

over REITs

The Japanese equity market correction managed to last just for one day after the US
election. The insurance sector has been the best performer since the US election on the
back of a steeper US Treasury curve and higher rates. Michael Hartnett observes
“violent rotation out of deflation to inflation plays”, including a move from REITs to US
banks. This should apply to Japan, where banks and insurance have underperformed
REITs amid relentless fall of the long-term yield and introduction of negative interest
rate by the Bo) (Chart 5). The domestic policy condition has changed, however, as the
Bo) is now reluctant to cut rate as it pays greater attention to the health of the financial
institution. The Bo) now intends to prevent the yield curve from flattening excessively.
While higher foreign yields may not lift yen rates as the Bo) controls the 10-year sector,
reflationary environment outside Japan at least reduces the risk of a deeper cut at home.
Outperformance of Japanese equities at the time of UST bear steepening has
historically been led by cyclicals, banks and insurance (Exhibit 2). David Gleeson is
cautious about REITs, while Futoshi Sasaki is constructive on banks. The move can
stretch further near-term.

article attached as Exhibit “OO”); (c) Epstein’s housekeeper Alfredo Rodriguez testified that
Dershowitz stayed at Epstein’s house during the years when Epstein was assaulting minor
fornafes on a daily basis; (d) Rodriguez testified that Dershowitz was at Epstein’s house at times
shen underage females where there being molested by Epstein (see Alfredo Rodriguez
deposition at 278-280, 385, 426-427); (e) Dershowitz reportedly assisted in attempting to
persuade the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office that because the underage females alleged to
have been victims of Epstein’s abuse lacked credibility and could not be believed that they were
at Epstein’s house, when Dershowitz himself was an eyewitness to their presence at the house;

Epstein but also Epstein’s “adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians,

SNV hesitant to react too quickly to post-election excitement. Chairman and
CEO Kessel Stelling noted that despite the very positive reaction seen in bank
stocks from the results of the US elections, it was too soon to say the real impact
on growth outlook. That said, he believes that a more encouraging business climate
(i.e. increased infrastructure spending) as well as some regulatory relief (i.e. raising
the $50bn asset threshold) could be a benefit for SNV and the overall industry.

= SNV could see a benefit at both ends of a steepening yield curve. As of 3Q16,
50% of SNV’s total loan portfolio was fixed rate (includes variable rate loans with
floors), implying a benefit to spread income from a rise in both the short- and long-

effectively in its immediate descendent. Eight-year-olds are investing in the next
generation of eight-year-olds, and so to the end. That’s why Fisher’s version of the
generation length is best. It prioritizes each cohort and gender without judgment as
to which matter more. The period of production gives our patience horizon. The

horizon and its reciprocal, the pure consumption rate, both hold the same at any age.

Cash Flow and Risk

The maximand rule notes that time preference and return vary with risk. Return is
growth rate plus cash flow rate. Is variance with risk captured more in one of these

two components than the other?

We might intuit that riskier and higher-return assets grow faster on average, over
enough time for the bumps of risk to even out. But if that tended to be true, the
universe of assets would grow progressively riskier over the decades and centuries.
That is not my reading of history. My impression is that smoother and rockier
periods come and go without overall trend. In the world we know, then, it is cash

flow rate rather than growth rate that varies from asset to asset with risk.

For illustration, consider factor risk. | argued that human capital figures to be the
riskier and higher return factor because assets tend to reflect the risk appetites of
their owners. The young are more risk-tolerant, and own human capital
disproportionately. If this higher return were reflected in higher growth, rather than
in higher cash flow, the ratio of human to physical capital would tend to rise steadily
over the millennia. Most readings have tended to see it the other way around. I
myself favor the neutral assumption that the factors keep pace. Then cash flow rate
becomes higher for human than physical capital, with 3.5% the cap-weighted

average.

hummed at such a basic level of the system that it proved impossible to fully patch.
It was like trying to patch physics.

Connection changes the nature of an object. This has a particular impact on the
security of our systems, and by extension, our own safety. Computer researcher
Nathaniel Husted has described a world of “emergent vulnerabilities” - wormholes
in software and hardware, communications or finance, that pop up in the connected
universe unbidden and unplanned. “The fundamental aspect of emergent
vulnerabilities and attacks,” Husted writes, “are that they appear benign until
certain criticality conditions are met, at which point they become malignant.” 142
These risks we don’t want sit right alongside all the things we do want from
connectivity. In fact - and this is Hulsted’s point — they are the things we want from
connectivity, perverted into danger.

Paul Baran would have been impressed to see just how right he was, how
connections between us now are like irresistible gravity waves - and how gravity
always wins. In 2015, for instance, Israeli security developed an astonishing hack
that proved that nearly spiritual claim that all objects were linked by connection-
and demonstrated the way that slippery, hungry attacks can breach even the safest-
looking arrangements. “It has been assumed that the physical separation of
computers provides a reliable level of security,” Mordechai Guri and his team wrote
in a paper describing how they had used one isolated machine to infect another.
Physical separation is, in fact, one of the cardinal rules of safe computing, a kind of
lemma to join Robert Morris Sr,’s “don’t connect” rule of network safety: Two
machines, unconnected by a network, should not be able to affect each other.
Imagine I put one kid with a flu in one classroom and a schoolmate of his in another
building. The second kid should remain healthy. The Tel Aviv research team wanted
to challenge this. They first placed two computers side by side on a desk,
unconnected to each other by any wire or network. One machine was connected to
the Internet. The other was completely isolated - it was “air gapped”, like the
healthy kid in the distant building, a sort of digital “boy in the bubble,” in touch with
only the air around it. Then, the researchers began their Houdini trick: Look! Watch
us corrupt this completely unconnected machine! Running a set of programs on the
network-connected machine, the Israeli team was able to warm the processor board
of that computer like a revving car engine, eventually making it hot enough that the
temperature changes were detected by sensors inside the secure, allegedly

Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

in the past with Chess and Go. Computer systems are initially inferior to their human counterparts but
quickly come to dominate the space.

The purpose of ACWs means they will be equipped with strategies for replication, persistence, and
stealth, all attributes that will make it hard to defend against them were they to “go rogue.” Because of
this concern, it is likely a good idea for designers to add built-in “kill switches”, lifetimes, or other
safety limitations. Figuring out how to effectively limit the actions of an ACW while maintaining its
usefulness is likely a very hard problem.

Current practices of cyber defense (especially against advanced threats) continue to be heavily reliant
on manual analysis, detection and risk mitigation. Unfortunately, human-driven analysis does not scale
well with the increasing speed and data amounts traversing modern networks. There is a growing
recognition that the future cyber defense should involve extensive use of autonomous agents that
actively patrol the friendly network, and detect and react to hostile activities rapidly (faster than
human reaction time), before the hostile malware can inflict major damage, or evade elimination, or
destroy the friendly agent. This requires cyber defense agents with a significant degree of intelligence,
autonomy, self-learning and adaptability. Autonomy, however, comes with difficult challenges of trust
and control by humans.

The scenario considers intelligent autonomous agents in both defensive and offensive cyber
operations. Their autonomous reasoning and cyber actions for prevention, detection and active
response to cyber threats will become critical enablers for both industry and military in protecting
large networks. Cyber weapons (e.g., malware) rapidly grow in their sophistication, and in their ability
to act autonomously and to adapt to specific conditions encountered in a system/network.

Agent’s self-preservation tactics are important for the continuous protection of networks, and if defeat
is inevitable the agent should self-destruct (i.e., corrupt itself and/or the system) to avoid being
compromised or tampered with by the adversary. Also, the notion of adversary must be defined and
distinguishable for the agent.

The system design and purpose is well intentioned — meant to reduce the load of human security
analysts and network operators, and speed up reaction times in cyber operations. The agent monitors
the systems in order to detect any adversarial activity, takes action autonomously, and reports back to
the central command unit regarding the incident and the action taken.

Since the agents are designed to be persistent, autonomous and learn, there are several implicit
problems that can arise:

e False reactions due to limited or misinformation — The agent has only a limited amount of
technical information that does not always correspond to what is happening in the human layer.
This can create false positives when trying to determine the adversary or adversarial activity. Since

"
IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021344.txt,"precedent found in courts around the
world dating back to the Middle Ages.
In times past and cultures in which
people did not so naturally restrict
intentional capacities to other humans,
animals (such as rats) and objects (such
as “possessed” statues) were common
targets of criminal prosecution'®”,
Increasing the extent to which other
agents seem mindful also increases the
praise or blame that they receive for
their actions. And even diminishing the
extent to which people feel in mindful
control of their own behavior (e.g., by
undermining people’s belief in free will),
leads people to behave in ways that are
consistent with diminished self-control
(such as by cheating on an exam when
tempted to do so).'*

Second, other minds are capable
of thinking, and may therefore be
thinking about you. Being under
scrutiny by mindful agents has two basic
effects on human behavior. One is that
mindful agents become sources of social
influence, increasing the extent to which
people behave in socially desirable
ways’. Imagine, for instance, how you
might behave if you found a magic ring
that made you invisible... and you'll get
the point. This ability for mindful
surveillance to control behavior has been
proposed as one of the reasons, if not the
primary reason, why religious systems
that posit an omnipresent deity are able
to maintain such large-scale cooperative
societies. The other effect of mindful
surveillance is that it is mentally taxing
to monitor others’ thoughts. This
effortful monitoring can diminish a
person’s performance on other
cognitively demanding tasks”. And
while waiting for a stressful event, such
as giving a speech, people show less
stress-related responses when in the
presence of their relatively mindless pet

Page |98

than when in the presence of their
relatively more mindful spouse”.

Finally, other minds matter
because mindful agents become moral
agents worthy of care and compassion’.
The principle of autonomy captures this
most basic of human rights—that
because all people have the same
minimal capacity to suffer, deliberate,
and choose, no person can compromise
the body, life, or freedom of another
person. Agents with mindful
experience, the capacity to suffer,
deliberate, and choose, become those
that evoke empathy and concern for well
being, whereas agents without mindful
experience can be treated simply as
mindless objects. From debates about
abortion to animal rights to euthanasia,
the mindful experience of the agents in
question is often either the explicit or
implicit focus of debate. Making
invisible minds visible, and hence more
like one’s own, enables people to more
readily follow the most famous of all
ethical dictates—to treat others as you
would have others treat you.

Conclusion

It is impossible for scientists to
examine whether God was looking out
for the passengers of flight 1549 or
punishing the residents of New Orleans
with Hurricane Katrina, but it is very
possible to examine why people might
make such inferences. These
examinations have revealed a
remarkable capacity to look beyond the
visible behavior that the environment
provides to reason about a completely
invisible world of intentions and goals,
of motives and beliefs, of attitudes and
preferences—an invisible world of other
minds. Understanding when people are
likely to recognize other minds (and see
into them) and when they are not is the

State of the Multifamily Market: Cooling or Collapsing?

We hosted a panel to discuss the state and the outlook for the multifamily market
following a year which has witnessed increased investor anxiety around multifamily loan
growth and heightened scrutiny by banking regulators of multifamily loan portfolios,
particularly at banks with a high concentration of multifamily loans. Our panelists
included John Jardine, Co-CEO of Ares Commercial Real Estate Corp, David
Brickman, Executive Vice President and the Head of Multifamily business at
Freddie Mac and Alan Fishman, Chairman of the Board at commercial real estate
investment trust Ladder Capital.

= Multifamily on solid footing: The panelists view the multifamily market as having
a solid foundation with most of the risk lying at the high end, class A properties in
particular markets (New York, San Francisco). Even here, the panelists agreed that
the issues at the high end segment were more likely to manifest themselves in the
form of decelerating growth in rents (and increased incentives by landlords) as
opposed to serious credit issues. Investors echoed this sentiment during a live
audience poll with 60% of the investors seeing issues in the multifamily market
limited to certain regions and at certain rental price points.

Consumer to face mixed trends

Labour policies are likely to remain a major focus for the Saudi government. Low oil
prices have dented the government’s direct ability to support the consumer compared
to the boom years. Furthermore, negative to flat public sector wage growth is likely to
dampen income and consumption trends, although Specialized Credit Institutions (SCIs)
could alleviate tightening banking sector household lending standards.

The NPT suggests a focus on boosting female employment as well as increasing the
cost of foreign labor relative to national labor. The latter implies a negative impact on
corporate margins and profits, in the event higher labor costs are not reflected in higher
consumer prices and inflation). The negative near-term cost and efficiency implications
of continued labour market reforms are mitigated by the fact that eventual increase in
private sector employment of higher-paid Saudi labour should prove supportive for
consumption trends once the dust settles.

The NTP targets increasing the cost of employment of Saudis compared to expatriates
from 400 to 280. We calculate that the ratio of private sector wages of Saudis
compared to non-Saudis stood at 3.64 and 1.29 for males and females respectively in
2015. The NTP target is thus akin to increasing non-Saudi private sector wages by 43%
over the period to 2020, a CAGR increase of 7.4%. This would squeeze corporate profits,
lead to inflationary pressures in the economy, and lead to annual additional Fx outflows
through remittances of US$2.8bn (0.4% of GDP). As such, it is more likely that the
employment cost of non-Saudis is likely to be increased through measures such as fees
for government services, taxes and levies. It is unclear that the NTP target can be met
solely through this route, but it would avoid additional Fx outflows despite still having a
negative impact on corporate margins and inflation, in our view.

The Nitaqat Saudization program is likely to be extended in the near-future through the
forthcoming launch of the “balanced Nitaqat” initiative. While employment quotas are
likely to be tightened, they will also take into account wage levels, job quality and
women employment ratios, according to local press. A likely target is likely to be
increased job creation for Saudis in the retail sector through higher quotas, in our view.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025260.txt,"Equities overview

Global equity markets - Key points

e We keep an overall neutral allocation to equities (see summary on slide 3).

° We keep our preference for US equities. Resilient company earnings still soeak for an overweight
stance. Continued economic growth should underpin earnings also in 2013.

¢ We keep our neutral stance on Eurozone equities. Value is attractive compared to global equities.
However, due to the recession in several countries the earnings dynamics remains weak. In addition,
uncertainty as to when and under what conditions Spain will sign a memorandum of understanding keeps
us from taking a more positive stance.

¢ We have an overweight position in EM equities. Monetary easing as well as fiscal stimulus in key
countries, coupled with relatively attractive valuations, are supporting factors. Economic activity is likely to
improve gradually over the coming quarters, supporting company earnings.

¢ We keep our negative stance on Canadian equities. Corporate earnings continue to decline, showing
a weak development relative to the global trend. In addition, valuation is not compelling.

¢ We are cautious on Australian equities. Realized earnings continue to come down for the market.

¢ We are neutral on Swiss equities. Companies show solid earnings growth, which is expected to hold up
better than in other regions. Although the Swiss franc is still overvalued, the weakening to the USD and
related currencies since this summer provides additional earnings support.

¢ We keep our neutral view on UK equities. In the UK the earnings dynamics lags behind other markets.
Also, the recent strengthening in the pound is a drag for earnings measured in local currency terms.

Global equity sectors - Key points

¢ We keep our overweight in Consumer Staples. Among the defensives it offers good earnings growth
prospects due to its geographically diversified revenue generation.

¢ We reiterate our preference for global IT due to a superior growth outlook and as we are in the
seasonally strong second half year. With healthy balance sheets and good cash flows, sector valuation is in
line with the overall market, while we believe it deserves a larger premium.

¢ We continue to like Healthcare as it offers solid long-term earnings prospects with low volatility and
strong balance sheets. We reiterate our underweight in Telecoms, where we expect ongoing weak
revenue growth as well as margin pressure.

¢ We are negative on Consumer Discretionary as earnings expectations may be too optimistic. With
leading indicators in major regions still deteriorating, we keep our underweight in Industrials. We have
concerns over weak manufacturing momentum leading to increased earnings revisions.

¢ The earnings outlook for US and Asian Financials is solid. We are neutral globally on Financials. While
the ECB's OMT program reduces tail risk for Financials, it has limited impact on sector earnings.

Article 6.

Ma'an News Agency
Palestine and Statehood: An historical

overview
Abdullah Abueid

24/08/2011 -- Until 1923, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire.
In December 1917, British troops entered Jerusalem and ended 400
years of Ottoman rule. In 1922, the League of Nations issued the
Mandate of Palestine which authorized the United Kingdom to
become the Mandatory Power in Palestine.

The Mandate Document, however, included several paradoxical
stipulations contrary to the Mandate System as set forth in Article 22
of the League's Charter.

Major stipulations

The Mandate Document included several paragraphs, which were
considered by many historians and international lawyers as flagrant
breaches of the word and spirit of the Mandate system. The system
was intended to protect the territories occupied by the British and
French from the axis enemy (Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire
and the Ottoman Empire), and to develop these territories to
independence and freedom for their populations.

The MD, contrary to that system, stipulated that the UK must develop
the territory of Palestine in cooperation with the Jewish Agency in
order to achieve a national home for the Jewish people, ignoring the
real interests of the vast majority of Palestinian Arabs or Palestine.

In 1922 Palestine was still considered as a part of the sovereignty of
the Ottoman Empire, which became Turkey after that date. It wasn't
until Turkey signed the Lausanne Treaty in 1932 that Turkey
relinquished her claim to sovereignty on Palestine. Thus, the MD was

guaranteed they will have differences with each other as well as with you, the witness.

You said, Iam reasonably sure that the traffic light was green

ahi

One report takes out the equivocation and quotes you as saying: The light was green.

This brings us to Federal law 18 USC 1001. That statute makes it a felony to he to the government. And
_ guess who decides whether or not you were lying? The government.

So here is your conundrum. Do you testify about your doubts about the light, which is the truth, ordo

Whether or not the 302 discrepancies are a result of stupidity or cupidity makes no difference.
Testify in opposition to the 302 and you are in the crosshairs of the Feds.

If they believe your testimony cost them the case, the next thing you likely to hear from the FBI will be:
Please place your hands behind your back. .

--A number of years ago, fed up with the 302 Two Step, I turned the tables on them. —

In a high profile case, my client was asked to submit to an FBI interview at their offices in North Miami
Beach.

Feigning naivety, I asked where the court reporter was. I was told there was no court reporter.
I then asked where the tape recorder was.

_[ will always be impressed that the agent was able to give us the response he did without laughing. He
said the FBI could not tape the interview because they did not have enough money in their budget.”

It was time to play the Trump Card.

At that point, I removed a cassette recorder from my pocket and explained that my client had been able
to scrape together the 59 cents for a cassette tape. Further we would pay for the tape to be transcribed
and supply them with a free copy of everything.

- “You could've heard a fart in a vacuum.

They now made it clear that no way, no how would any FBI interview be recorded. So we went forward
with the interview as the agent took notes.

Months later the client was called to testify at trial.

_ T warned him the 302 would be a work of fiction. It was. I was sitting in the back of the courtroom.

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *894

Because a victim has the right to be heard on a Guidelines issue, a victim also has the right to see the document which contains
the Guidelines calculations - the presentence report. **? Congress intended the victim's right to be heard to be construed
broadly, as Senator Feinstein stated: The victim of crime, or their counsel, should be able to provide any information, as well
as their opinion, directly to the court concerning the ... sentencing of the accused. **4 It is hard to see how victims can
meaningfully provide any information that would have a bearing on the sentence without being informed of the Guidelines
calculations that likely will drive the sentence and reviewing the document that underlies those calculations.

An independent basis for victims reviewing presentence reports is within the victim's broad right under the CVRA to be
treated with fairness. 7+ This right easily encompasses a right of access to relevant parts of the presentence report. The
victim's right to fairness gives victims a free-standing right to due process. As Senator Kyl instructed, Of course, fairness
includes the notion of due process ... . [*895] This provision is intended to direct government agencies and employees,
whether they are in the executive or judicial branches, to treat victims of crime with the respect they deserve and to afford them
due process. 74° Due process principles dictate that victims have the right to be apprised of Guidelines calculations and
related issues. The Supreme Court has explained that it is ... fundamental that the right to ... an opportunity to be heard must
be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” 747 It is not meaningful for victims to make sentencing
recommendations without the benefit of knowing what everyone else in that courtroom knows: the recommended Guidelines
range and how that range was derived. Congress plainly intended to pass a law establishing fair play for crime victims,
meaningful participation of crime victims in the justice system, [and] protection against a government that would take from a
crime victim the dignity of due process. 748 In federal sentencing today, meaningful participation means participation
regarding Guidelines issues.

It is interesting that the federal law allowing appointment of a guardian ad litem for juvenile victims appears to allow for access
to the presentence report. The law guarantees that, upon appointment, a guardian ad litem may have access to all reports,
evaluations and records, except attomey's work product, necessary to effectively advocate for the child. 74° In a recent federal
shaken baby case in Arizona, a guardian for the child victim received access to the presentence report under this provision.
2>0 The guardian in that case found it exceedingly difficult to formulate an appropriate sentencing recommendation without
access to the presentence report. After successfully gaining access to the report, she found a need to change her original
recommendation. She later reported that but for the [*896] disclosure, I would have ended up making a mis-informed
recommendation. 7°!

A victim's right to review the presentence report is also important to ensure proper restitution. Federal law guarantees most
victims of serious crimes the right to restitution. *°* Reinforcing those laws, the CVRA guarantees that victims have the right

43 Magistrate Judge Orenstein of the Eastern District of New York, who has written many thoughtful opinions on the CVRA, has taken a
contrary position. See Report and Recommendation, United States v. Ingrassis, No. CR 04-0455 at 31 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2005) (In the
absence of any change to applicable rules or the Guidelines, the court is under no legal obligation to ensure such disclosure of the
presentence report.). For the reasons explained here, I think he takes too narrow a view of the victim's rights at sentencing.

Lebanese army colors and had them hide overnight in the moshav’s orchards, a
hundred yards from the road on the Lebanese side of the frontier. The next
morning, when we got confirmation the convoy was on its way, they crossed
and stationed themselves on the road, lifted the hood of one of the vehicles and
made as if they were trying to repair engine trouble. Both the blocking forces
were in half-tracks with heavy machine-guns in case the convoy chose to stand
and fight.

What we didn’t count on was a Lebanese driver, ina VW Beetle as I recall,
puttering along the road shortly after Yoni’s team crossed. The man waved at
them. Quite rightly, Yoni let him drive on. Along with the other obvious reasons
not to fire on a civilian VW, he didn’t want to alert the Syrians and their hosts
there was danger ahead. But the Lebanese motorist, as well as a group of nearby
farmers, were suspicious enough to deliver a warning that there were a couple
of stalled Land Rovers on the side of the road. The convoy halted shortly after
passing Mookie’s force, hidden in a field a few dozen yards away.

Had I not been in the command post, I’m pretty sure what would have
happened next. The mission would have been called off. This time, I was the
one in direct contact with all three teams. Even before I gave the order, Yoni
had anticipated it. He and Uzi turned west to confront the convoy. In a brief
initial exchange of gunfire, one of Uzi’s men was wounded, not seriously, in the
leg. But with Mookie’s team firing from behind and Yoni’s and Uzi’s men in
front, the convoy was trapped, and the Syrians captured.

The safest way back into Israel would have been the way the force had
entered. But Yoni and Uzi realized the main imperative was to get the Syrians
out as quickly as possible. At a not-inconsiderable cost to a pair of American
limousines, Uzi drove each of them, with a total of five Syrian officers, through
a boulder-strewn field across the border.

The Syrians included three senior members of the Operations Department of
the General Staff, and two from Air Force intelligence. Israel made an
immediate offer to swap them for our pilots, though how enthusiastically ’m
not sure. With this kind of leverage on our side, it seemed unlikely the Syrians
would do further harm to our pilots. Our intelligence officers were keen to get
every bit of information they could before sending the Syrians home. It would
be a year later before the exchange was done. Yoni received a well-deserved
tzalash for his role in the mission.

- 2018.

* Do you now work on papers and permits?

- That is right.

* lf Aramco is sold. Who will determine the ceiling of Aramco's production?

- Determination of the production ceiling would be the prerogative of the Saudi government, increasing
the production at the price that suits the company is in favor of the Government of Saudi Arabia. A part
of the governmental revenues is from the oil tax (50%) on the oil sold or produced, as well as the taxes it
receives from Aramco. The government's interest is to develop the profits of Aramco, meaning that the
government will not take a decision that violates its interests and the interests of Aramco in the rate of
production.

* Your Highness the prince, the subject of production with the economic vision and mentality in the
market, will the production be freed from the political decision?

- Production is not a political decision, production is an economic decision, it was not a political decision
at all in the past, production is an economic decision, what is the economic benefit to determine the
appropriate production price, this is governed by supply and demand and coordination with OPEC
countries and countries outside OPEC to coordinate the amount of supply and demand so that there is
no collapse or confusion in oil prices.

* One of the programs that have been launched last Sunday, is the investment program to stimulate 100
companies to turn either to regional or to international companies, what are the companies targeted to
raise their level?

- | cannot name companies now, there are companies where part of them is in the stock market and
companies outside the stock market. We acquire more than 100 companies that have the opportunity to
turn from a local company into a leading regional company. We also acquire companies that have the
opportunity to turn from a leading regional company to a leading global company, and we have a group
of companies that can achieve this transformation and this huge impact that will be reflected on the
Saudi economy. They need easy procedures, facilities and agreements with other countries, facilitate
their sales, and facilitate their spread.

* Will the government negotiate on behalf of companies and take care of their interests?

- Undoubtedly, we can touch that all the governments of the world are doing this. The last of which was
few days ago when we had the German Chancellor with the managers of the most important companies
in Germany, and she was negotiating as if these companies are belonging to the German government,
she also was entering in all the details for the success of the work of these companies. The Saudi
government should play its role to turn the success of Saudi national companies. This will transform 100
Saudi companies from local leading companies to regional leading companies and from regional leading
companies to global leading companies, and also this will provide us with experience in how to turn
these companies into large ones so that after 2020 we operate programs targeting a wider range of
these companies.

“The prosecution in the insanity trial of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer
rested its case. Dahmer has confessed to killing and dismembering 17
young males since 1978. A jury must decide if he will be sent to prison or a
mental institution. The final prosecution witness, Dr. Park Dietz, a
psychiatrist, testified that Dahmer wore condoms when having sex with his
dead victims, showing that he could control his urge to have intercourse
with corpses.”

sane enough to have safe sex, what about you?”

the U.S. These delays were also the result of the false link between Plaintiffs and Epstein. Asa

Congress is all over the place, Gates says at one point. And the
Republicans are a perfect example. I mean, you've got the budget
hawks and then you've got the defense hawks within the same party.
And so I think there is no consensus on a role in the world.

In some ways, the first part of his tenure was easier. During the Bush
years, money was never an issue. By contrast, Obama faced a harsh
economic reality, and Gates tried to get in front of the issue by
shrinking the Pentagon budget. But his cuts satisfied neither hawks
nor doves nor the White House. This spring, when Obama announced
a $400 billion reduction in defense spending, Gates got just 24 hours’
notice. Gates, who'll be succeeded by CIA chief Leon Panetta, wins
bipartisan accolades for restoring morale at the Pentagon and, more
important, repairing relations with Congress, which had grown
distrustful of the Defense Department under Rumsfeld.

Bridging two administrations, Gates gets credit for stabilizing Iraq,
though the key decisions that led to success--a surge of troops and the
appointment of Gen. David Petraeus to oversee the strategy--predated
his arrival. Petraeus says Gates knew that his real contribution was
to buy time in Washington for the strategy to succeed.  Your battle
space is Iraq. My battle space is Washington,'  Petraeus recalls Gates
telling him. Gates concedes he was sometimes on the wrong side of
an issue. For instance, he was gun-shy about using ground troops to
kill Osama bin Laden, arguing that Obama should opt for an airstrike
instead. Gates hesitated because he feared a repeat of the bungled
1980 attempt to free American hostages in Iran that killed eight U.S.
servicemen. I was very explicit with the president in one of the
discussions, Gates acknowledges. I said: 'Mr. President, I want
truth in lending. Because of experience, I may be too cautious, you
know.'? Obama overruled Gates, siding with those who wanted to
deploy the elite Navy SEALs, securing the biggest victory in the 10-
year war on terror. Rather than a transformational figure, a more

11. Over the next few weeks, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghis-
laine Maxwell trained me to do what they wanted, including
sexual activities. The training was in New York and Florida,
at Epstein’s mansion. It was basically every day and it was
like going to school. I also had to have sex with Epstein many
times.

12. I was trained to be “everything a man wanted me to
be.” It wasn't just sexual training—they wanted me to be
able to cater to all the needs of the men they were going to
send me to. They said that they loved that I was very compli-
ant and knew how to keep my mouth shut about what they
expected me to do.

13. Epstein and Maxwell also told me that they wanted
me to produce information for them in addition to perform-
ing sex on the men. They told me to pay attention to the
details about what the men wanted, so I could report back to
them.

14. While I had juvenile hopes of bettering my life, from
very early on I was also afraid of Epstein. Epstein told me he
was a billionaire. I told my mother that I was working for

this rich guy, and she said “go, go far away.” Epstein had
promised me a lot, and I knew if I left I would be in big trou-
ble. I was witness to a lot of illegal and bad behavior by
Epstein and his friends. If I left Epstein, he knew all kinds of
powerful people. He could have had me killed or abducted,
and I knew he was capable of that if I did not obey him. He
let me know that he knew many people in high places. Speak-
ing about himself, he said “I can get away” with things. Even
as a teenager, I understood what this meant and it scared me,

as I believe he intended.

Bannon the European: He’s opening the populist fort in Brussels

The former Trump strategist arrives in Europe with The Movement. Objective: an alliance
between right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections

NEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru
who was Donald Trump’s right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following
the racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the
Daily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (Il Movimento), right in
the heart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in
view of the European elections which will be held in spring 2019.

Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor
of the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in
support of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist
right, accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in
order to have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current
Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini.

The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in
the European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London
and Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of
which he has long since been dreaming.

The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of
strategic advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme
European movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and
channeling funding.

The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May.

Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own.

The American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US
Congress — and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016

| A. The Summary Judgment Standard.

Rule 1,510(c), Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that a court may enter summary
juiigenent when the-pleadings, depositions and factual showings reveal that there is no genuine
issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See
Sayer y. Cheezem Development Corp., 373 So. 2d 719, 720 (Fla. 2d DCA 1979); Rule 1.510(c),
Fla. R, Civ. P. Once the moving party conclusively establishes that the nonmoving party cannot
prevail, it is incumbent on the nonmoving party to submit evidence to rebut the motion for
summary judgment. See Holl v. Talcott, 191 So. 2d 40, 43 (Fla. 1966), It is not enough for the
—— party merely to assert that an issue of fact does exist. Fisel v. Wynns, 667 So.2d 761,
764 (Fla.1996); Landers v. Milton, 370 So.2d 368, 370 (Fla.1979) (same).

| Moreover, it is well-recognized that the non-moving party faced with a summary
judgment motion supported by appropriate proof may not rely on bare, conclusory assertions
found in the pleadings to create an issue and thus avoid summary judgment. Instead, the party
must produce counter-evidence establishing a genuine issue of material fact. See Bryant v.
Shands Teaching Hospital and Clinics, Inc., 479 So.2d 165, 168 (Fla. 1st Dist. Ct. App. 1985);
see also Lanzner v. City of North Miami Beach, 141 So.2d 626 (Fla. 3d Dist Ct. App. 1962)

judgment on basis of facts established without dispute). Where the nonmoving party fails to

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022117
"
TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022746.txt,"﻿	It’s an absurdly vast house, among the largest in Manhattan, but the dining room is windowless, creating a hermetic or stop-time sense, broken only by the household help ferrying in time-of-day-appropriate foods and beverages. 
     In sweatshirt, draw-string pants, palm beach slippers, and half glasses, Jeffrey Epstein sits at the head of the table. He spends most of his day in the dining room, remote from the world, in front of a lap top and beside a row of reading glasses (there are a lot of them in case, apparently, he misplaces a pair, but being quite meticulous he never does) advising, or instructing, a startling collection of the rich and powerful, slotted in on an hourly basis. 
     The apartness of Epstein’s dining room might seem to offer some buffer in this leveled, angry age for a super rich man who attends to even more fabulously rich men (and the occasional extremely rich woman). On the other hand, with the paparazzi often posted near by, the outside world seem dangerously close too. (Once I arrived for a visit and found several police cars blocking the street and thought the worst—they’d come for Jeffrey. But it was a security detail for a controversial head of state, also visiting him.)
     His subject for the morning is “hyper wealth.” His subject is always wealth—how capital should react to the given global political, economic, and cultural moment. The otherwise baronial dining room is disturbed by an ever-present white board, on which he scribbles calculations and notes, conducting perhaps the world’s most rarified economics class, often to many of the world’s finance ministers and foremost economists. 
     Epstein’s apartness or parallel life reflects much of the other-worldly characteristics of the wealth revolution that began in the late 1970s and that continued through the Wall Street boom of the 80s, the tech boom of the 90s—surviving, to often bitter attack, the banking crisis—and that has now seen the emergence of the international billionaire and oligarch class. He has quite turned himself into a hyperbolic representations of this wealth and hence, in a way, become accountable for it.
     His own way to riches was to become a canny student of the new money, as well as one of its large than life characters, as it grew to an unanticipated and disruptive scale. His stock in trade is not precisely the making of money, but the issues that arise when money, at a heretofore unimaginable rate, makes itself, altering many basic economic, social and personal calculations. 
     He recounts a dinner he had two nights before. It is, like much of what he does, a conspiracist’s fantasy. The six men at this dinner, all technology entrepreneurs, represented, together, several hundred billion dollars. 
     “In the past, only governments had this kind of money,” says Epstein conversationally, but making a pedagogical point, “money of a reality altering scale. In fact, it used to be that the rich, reaching a certain point of philanthropy, merely hoped to help make the world a better place, now they want to change the world. Rockefeller and Carnegie were, as examples of social-engineering philanthropy, unique. They alone had such resources and will. Now you have legions of people who have to give away vastly larger fortunes than Rockefeller or Carnegie had at their disposal, or might even have imagined. 
     “Except that it’s actually hard to give away this kind of wealth, without unintended consequences that can cause more problems than you’re solving.” 
     Epstein’s long-time business thesis is that the rich know very little about money. They may know about their own businesses, but the great sums that are the result are an ultimate after thought and demand an entirely different sort of intellectual discipline. The Forbes 400, says Epstein, not immune to an amount of wonder, increased their wealth by $500 billion last year, meaning, in effect, that on average every Forbes-list billionaire makes more than another billion every year. And, points out the 62-year-old Epstein, they will almost all be dead in 40 years, most well before that, meaning $4.2 trillion, compounding everyday, will have to be given away. “So, to understand the future, what you have to begin to do is follow the money, not in Watergate-like terms backwards, as in who has gotten it, but forwards to where it will go and who will get it.”
     Epstein can find himself echoing aspects of Thomas Piketty on the inequities of the accumulation of wealth (“the divide is between people with assets, which appreciate, and people without assets, who fail to advance—that is, of course, the miracle of compounded interest”), except for the fact that Epstein, knowing the rich, understands a curious point that Piketty doesn’t: “Nobody, nobody, wants to give it all to their children. Everybody now has the modern appreciation that one of the curses of great wealth is that it can make your kids weird and fucked up.”
     Epstein’s position in this private allotment of a decent fraction of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product is not as philanthropist but as a higher sort of banker or guru or brain—a rich whisperer—making him, in addition to rich himself, arguably, among the most influential people you’ve never heard of. 
     Though, likely, you have heard of him, but not for his prowess with high abstraction, but for a scandal of such luridness that he is, for a great many, the poster child of the lawlessness of privilege, and for a much smaller circle, the poster child for what can happen when you become the target of a resentful world. He is that Epstein, according to the Daily Mail—among his most frothing-at-the-mouth antagonists—“one of America’s most notorious sex offenders.”
     
     And yet the mighty and powerful, apparently evaluating the nature of disgrace on their own terms, beat a path to his door. It’s a fantastic conclave of influence in his dining room: financiers, billionaires, heads of state, economic ministers.
     He surely represents the kind of insiderism that is mostly just a figment in outsiders’ fantasies. Except for the fact that, straining credulity, Epstein is real. His is an ultimate sort of fantasy of power, wealth, and secrecy. (In 2004, when the then owners of this magazine put it up for sale, I was involved with a group trying to buy it—an effort in which Epstein volunteered to invest $20 million. New York was subsequently sold to another wealthy investor.) Were the International Jewish conspiracy to actually exist, it might be here in his dining room (while not everybody in his circle is Jewish, an obvious “think Yiddish” point of view prevails).
     Without ever being asked to keep what I have heard here off the record, I’ve willingly done so, least I not be invited back. And, too, to protect him. Who would understand Jeffrey? Who could explain him? 
     Certainly Epstein’s past encounters with the press (and in many ways with the entire outside world) have been about as disastrous as any could be, helping to open a Pandora’s box of lifestyle vulnerabilities that sent him to prison on a prostitution charge in 2008. 
     And yet here he is, in his 50,000 square foot mansion, dispensing advice to world leaders and business titans. 
     Indeed, Epstein has been advising Bill Gates on a new way to increase the already vast clout of the Gates Foundation by adding funds from other wealthy individuals that can use the Gates resources (the Gates Foundation now employs 1,200 people), but which can be directed to separate causes and goals. And it is Gates who at the end of the summer began prodding Epstein to begin a process of public rehabilitation.
     Hence, as part of an effort to get “out in front” of the unfavorable notice that might greet Gates’ public association with him, Epstein agreed to several on the record conversation with me, in the hope, on his part, that, after five years since his release from prison and relative peace, he might be able to leaven his reputation. And with the hope on my part of learning more about how and if the rich are different than you and me (although we can fairly dispense with the if).

     Then, just before the New Year, Epstein forwarded me a heads-up email that Alan Dershowtiz, one of Epstein’s long time friends—they have a bickering brotherly relationship—and occasional legal advisors, had received from a reporter at Politico and forwarded to Epstein. The Politico reporter had been following Epstein-related court filings (there is a determined contingent of Epstein reporters) and found a new one added to an old law suit with some rather jaw-dropping claims.
     Eight years after the original suit, a Florida lawyer was now seeking to add new plaintiffs to the old case. This new filing was accompanied by allegations connecting a catch-all of bold-faced names associated with Epstein more than ten years ago, including Dershowtiz and Britain’s Prince Andrew, to a “sex slave” ring—indeed, that Epstein’s purported sex slaves had had sex with Dershowitz and the Prince at Epstein’s command. 
     This seemed to me to be merely a desperate, even comic-book, filing—just a lawyer trying to revive a dead case. I responded to Epstein that I doubted this would be seen as credible by anyone.
     Epstein, who sometimes seems to have an out-of-body attitude to his own fate and bad press, said he thought it might be “quite a show.”
     Two days later, the Daily Mail, which has become the effective ground zero in the English language for anti-privilege, and moral opprobrium (the more salacious the better), and whose editor Paul Dacre has a long time feud with Prince Andrew, put the story on its front page. (Epstein also has a long relationship with the family of disgraced press baron, Robert Maxwell, another reliable target of the British press.) Flimsy and far-fetched court filings in the U.S. by settlement-hungry plaintiffs might be discounted by skeptical U.S. reporters, but, the U.K. media, constrained by onerous rules about legal proceedings in the U.K., promptly went into tabloid frenzy (even the normally sniffy Guardian, in full anti- royal and anti- billionaire fever, joined the tabloid show) and effectively exported the story back to the U.S., where Epstein’s connection to Bill Clinton, and, hence as a shadow over Hillary, became the news. 
     “I told you,” said Epstein.
     
     There is Epstein in his inner world, trying, quite ostrich like, not to look out. Little beyond his strict realm seems palatable or even in a sense familiar to him. He’s a foreigner out here. Not too long ago, I met him for lunch in the West Village, the first time in more than ten years, he said, he’d been out to lunch in a restaurant (a not particularly pleasant experience for him and we were done in 30 minutes). 
     Then there is the outside world pressed to the glass, appalled and titillated by the monster inside the big house—a kind of Boo Radley of the Upper East Side. I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the reaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same: a gasp. Press accounts, seldom supplying new information, ever recycle and repeat the mysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology, with brief glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos endlessly republished), and the assumption of depravity inside.
     In fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional domestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a life somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.
     The domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s problems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support staff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying, having children, and continuing as part of his business and household infrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently married, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein had arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend is in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish model and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and married hedge funder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will travel with him to his other floating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, a vast apartment in Paris, the Island in the Caribbean, the house in Palm Beach. 
     This is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic relationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward or straight-faced way. It sometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at me, but do you even believe what you see? Or it seems he is just oblivious to what others are thinking. A willful and perhaps fatal tone deafness. 
     But Hefnerian prurience can also be quite businesslike: poised young women in a mansion on the Upper East Side with various office responsibilities are really not that different from any of the art galleries in the surrounding neighborhood. 
     Epstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so much as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves”), but often as attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its own fetish-like attraction).
     Not long ago, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to him in his dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making investments based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This method can often have uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it doesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of successful investing, quickly copies and discounts the advantage. Epstein’s effort was to identify a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is effectively hawking his secret sauce algorithm) and invest up to $5 million with each. I knew paltry little about this and so rather found myself identifying with the young women to whom Epstein was explaining the basic math and mechanics—out of my league, but grateful for the lesson.
     The Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and club like, part hang out, part secret society. Along with the difficulty in explaining why, even after his jail term, the rich and powerful continued to beat a path to his door, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose turf, that everybody, when they went to see Epstein, comes to him.
     A week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on Sunday, at Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, Mort Zuckerman, and Peter Thiel [TK].
     Epstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the politics of the middle of east, entertained that evening a delegation from Qatar, including Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim, the foreign minister. Hamad, indeed, lives across the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the same decorator. Epstein, in his relaxed and amused manner, kept prodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of that?” 
     The Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most worried that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery allegations.
     At 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining room by Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in trouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein and is one of attorney general Eric Holder’s closest friends. Weingarten, horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just back from a failed defense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland. 
     After a blow by blow of the trial, there’s a discussion of the Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving chocolate made from pistachios grown on the Sheikh’s farm—and speculation about who actually controls ISIS. 
     “Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the room, “do some many people keep coming back here, everything considered.”
     “Why we camp out here? I guess because there’s no place like it.” 
     Epstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-room. It’s a young man named Brock Pierce, a former child actor, and dotcom high flyer—a principle in a gaming company called DEN, a notorious dotcom burnout, with its own sex scandal—who is now a leading investor in Bitcoin. He describe himself as the “the most active investor in the field.”
     And, indeed, is the first clear explanation I actually get about Bitcoin. It is so good that Epstein stops him and checks to see if his next appointment is here. And seconds later, Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and President of Harvard, enters the dining room. Summers, off Diet Coke, digs deep into the Sheikh’s chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.
     “Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here. But an additional feature of my decision problem roughly speaking is that the worst that could happen to you is that you could lose all the money you put into it. Whereas, I could go—I mean I don’t look that great now—but I could go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence to being a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity…”
     “Well,” says Pierce in some dramatic understatement, “you are going to have some low quality characters playing early in the space…”
     That evening, there is a small cocktail party, which includes the former Prime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and Thorbjørn Jaglandthe head of the Noble Peace Prize Committee, who offers an affable, but general scathing, critique of U.S. diplomacy (and a brief defense of Obama’s Peace Prize award) and to whom Epstein offers a ride back to Europe on his jet. 
     The next morning, it’s Ehud Barack, the former Israeli Prime Minister and Israel, for breakfast. Barack is, over his omelet, able to defend both Obama and Putin. Then Kathy Ruemmler, who has just left her job as White House Counsel joins. She is already in the mix as a possible next attorney general, but, in fact, will withdraw from consideration in part to work with Epstein. [TK Ruemmler quotes…]
     Larry Summers wife, Elisa New, drops by. She teaches American poetry at Harvard and is putting together a proposal for a series on poetry that WGBH in Boston may produce and Epstein is advising on where she might go for added support (he also makes mince meat of her budget). 
     There follows the former head of the UN Security Council, Hardeep Purie, and then head of the central bank of Kazakhstan, Kairat Kelimbetov. 
     Then Nathan Myhrvold the former chief technology office at Microsoft. Then Martin Nowak a Professor of Biology and Mathematics and Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, the institute that Epstein has funded with $30 million. Part of Nowak’s research has to do with trying to “describe cancer mathematically.” Epstein preempts Nowak’s explanation (which I’m not quite getting): “Think of cancer the same way as you think of a terrorist group. The NSA has been able to thwart a great number of terrorism acts by intercepting communication signals from one terrorist to another. That same dynamic, a form of signal intelligence, of finding a terrorist in Europe, can be used to intercept communication between cancer sells. Cancer cells merely communicate in protean code rather than electronic code. If you can decode what the signals are saying you can jam those signal between terrorist calls—essentially wipe out their cell phones. Likewise if you can decode biological signals you can jam them too, that’s the holy grail.”
     Then Richard Azel, a Nobel prize winner in physiology. Then Ron Baron who, in his Baron Fund, has $26 billion under management. Then Josh Harris the co-founder of Apollo Global Management ($164 billion under management) and owner of the New Jersey Devils and the Philadelphia 76ers.

     Perhaps it’s just the ultimate feminist nightmare: Men (and a few opportunistic women) continue to come to Epstein’s because—no matter their public bows to modern manners—they simply don’t care that he offends every aspect of reconstructed gender and political sensibilities. In private, it remains a man’s world—a rich man’s world.
     Or, it’s a guilty pleasure. People who know Jeffrey exchange “Jeffrey” stories. “That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, the real estate billionaire and publisher of the Daily News (ever vitriolic in its coverage of Epstein), with a twinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of Epstein escapades. It is an outréness that Epstein seems delighted to cultivate. In his Paris apartment, 10,000 square feet on the Avenue Foch, a neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates, there is a stuffed baby elephant in his living room—that is, the elephant in the room. (Epstein says too it’s a reminder that elephants have 23 copies of tumor suppressor genes and humans have only 1.)  The single book on his bedside table is Lolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).
     Or, in a more sophisticated view, it’s a two tier understanding of the world. There is a media version of the world, which most of us live in and largely accept, and are certainly influenced by. And then there are those people who live in the media itself and therefore know that it’s mostly bunk. If the media says it, as likely some version of the opposite is true. I might guess too that for many of his visitors there’s an order of identification: there but for the grace of God. Any hyper-prominent person might, at any time, run afoul of prosecutors, the political moment, the media, or the Internet hoi polloi. 
     In this view, Epstein is a sort of Dreyfus of the rich.
     And then there is the glue of wealth. Once, at lunch in the Epstein dinning room with Bill Richardson, the former Governor of New Mexico, and past Presidential aspirant, when Epstein left the room for a few minutes, I asked the obvious question, the one everybody asks each other, “How did you meet Jeffrey?” Richardson seemed surprised: “Jeffrey,” he said, as though stating what should have been perfectly obvious, “is the biggest landowner in New Mexico.”
     And then there is Epstein’s yet more structural explanation as to why after prison and with continuing tabloid infamy he can maintain his valued place. It comes back, not unexpectedly, to the nature or the needs of money:
     “At a certain level of finance, almost everyone is allied with an institutional interest. You are part of government, or you want to be in government, or you are connected to a bank or other portfolio, or you have key relationships with certain corporations or industries. Because of my situation, I have none of that. I have no institutional ties which makes me in some sense one of the few wholly independent sources of information and actual honest brokers. That’s the usefulness of disgrace.”
     And then there is too, that he is right. Since I began working on this piece in September, Epstein predictions about the price of oil, yen, ruble, and euro have all born out. ((If I had invested $100,000 the way Epstein said I should in early September, by the end of January I would have made $TK million. Alas, I did not invest.)
     And something else, which perhaps also surely accounts for Epstein’s continuing relationships with the rich and powerful: 
     Most everyone who is now of a certain age and certain ambition and certain status grew up in, and found they were temperamentally suited to, the new age of wealth that started in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids, or, as Vanity Fair would baldly and ingratiatingly dub it, the new establishment, an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at further and further remove from the ordinary one. Epstein is just one version, albeit picaresque, as well as louche, of this shared story. 
     
     He often tells, with some obvious marvel, his middle class to riches tale: born in 1953 in Coney Island, father works for the city’s Parks Department, mother a housewife.
      The captain of the math team at Lafayette High school in Bensonhurst, goes on to Cooper Union where the tuition is free. He drops out after two years and begins taking classes at the NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematics. Then, without a college degree, hence by a slight of hand, gets a job teaching math and physics at Dalton in 1974. (A few years ago, during a chance encounter with a former Dalton math department chairman, Margo Gumport, I asked her about Epstein. She said he was the most brilliant math teacher at Dalton in her 50-year career and that she had often wondered what had become of him.)
     It’s his first exposure to the wealthy. They have, he concludes, just as many problems as the people in Coney Island, just different ones, almost invariably involving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a science experiment,” he recalled recently as we chatted about his life. “It did not really involve me. I could just stand back and watch.”
     Dalton fathers were attracted to him. Punch Sulzberger, the publisher of the New York Times, and a Dalton father at the time, tried to recruit Epstein to come to the Times. (Epstein recounts a story of riding with Sulzberger in his wood paneled station wagon to the family’s country estate and Sulzberger talking to the chauffer on a phone from the backseat to the front.) 
     In 1976, another Dalton father, asking “wouldn’t you rather be rich than be a teacher?” introduced him to Bear Stern’s chief Ace Greenberg, a conversation Epstein recounts as this:
     Greenberg: “Everyone tells me you’re super smart in math and you’re Jewish and you’re hungry…so why don’t you start working here tomorrow?”
     Epstein: “What?”
     Greenberg: “If your supposed to be so fucking smart, don’t you understand English?”
     Epstein: “Ok. Count me in.”
     Hence, Epstein, like many in the late 70s, arrived on Wall Street.
     As will happen to a generation of others, by the fortuitous luck of being on Wall Street at that point in time, Epstein is transformed by a new, much faster, form of upward mobility than has ever before existed. With a facility for mathematics as well as for getting along with rich men, he transforms at an even faster rate than so many others who are also being quickly transformed. 
     He moves into the penthouse of a new building at 66th Street and Second Avenue—still in the shadow of the Maxwell Plum era when the 60s on Second was the glamour address—a building that was he says, as a fond memory, full of “actresses, models, and euro trash.” (It would shortly become the Studio 54 era, where Epstein, who has never had drink or taken any drugs, was a regular). 
     If on one side of Wall Street there were the salesmen (the Wolf of Wall Street model), on the other side there was a new sort of finance type able to embrace a level of acute abstraction.
     “In the past,” says Epstein, “investing was all about reputations and relationships. You invested in a company on the basis of who was running it. Did they have integrity? Were they married? Good family men? It was a 50’s mentality. But in the mid 70s options started to be traded. In essence, the first formal derivatives. The movement of this instrument is not directly attached to the stock price. The world of investing began turning from relationships to math. In a sense I didn’t really make money as much as I tried to create it. This was intellectual activity of a fairly high order.”
     Intellectual activity aside, he meets Helen Gurley Brown and she makes him Cosmopolitan Magazine’s Bachelor of the Month in 1980.
     “What,” I ask, “was your social life like?”
     “Well, I was a playboy.”
     “That’s all? Not looking to get married?”
     “No. Never. I never wanted to get married. I enjoyed sex. I adore women. I wanted freedom. I was attracted to the rich because of their freedom. But I wanted also to avoid their burdens. And I didn’t want to hide. I didn’t want to be a hypocrite. I wanted to be free. I was not remotely ambivalent about what I wanted: to be free. That was the reason to make money.”
     His rise at Bear Sterns was a steep one. And he soon became the protégée of Jimmy Cayne (also hired by Ace Greenberg on a whim—he met him in a bridge game—who would go on to run Bear and to lose his fortune in Bear’s 2006 collapse). Epstein’s leave taking or ouster from Bear is the result of politics, envy, overreaching, or a securities violation, or…unclear. But, no matter, he leaves in 1982 with billionaire clients, including Marvin Davis, a real estate developer who owns Twentieth Century Fox, and Herb Seigel, a major media investor in the 1980s. Epstein is dating Morgan Fairchild, a television star in the new mega-rich-family soap operas, Dallas and Falcon Crest (plot lines from which Epstein might easily step). 
     Now begins the Concorde phase of his life—and the Concorde phase of the 1980s. If the 80s are happening pell mell in New York, they’re happening at double time and catch up speed in London. Epstein is 30 years old and living, in Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous fashion (he befriends the show’s star, Robin Leach), at English shooting parties at country estates with Saturday night black tie dinners, where he’s meeting the over-the-top families of Europe. 
     “I didn’t take it seriously,” Epstein recounts. “I was not caught up in it. I wasn’t trying to make a billion dollars. There was no ultimate goal. It was just fun to meet smart people, interesting people. But no long-range plans. Often no short-term plans either. I would head to Kennedy and, on the theory that most important events in one’s life are serendipitous, I wouldn’t decide where I was going until I got there.”
	At the same time, he is developing a perception, or, at least a market differentiation: the hyper wealthy had different problems than the very wealthy. Dealing with a billion dollars was different from dealing with $100 million:
     “If you had a billion dollars I would think the last thing you should be worried about was money, in truth money was what you most worried about. How to make more of it, how to give away more of it, how to protect you children from it, how to hide it from your wife or husband, how to minimize your taxes on it. The traditional wealth service structure, an accountant, and investment advisor, a personal lawyer, and an idiot brother-in-law, became hopelessly outdated as amounts exponentially increased. 
	“You can’t spend a billion dollars, you can just reallocate it to a different investment class. And you can’t give away a billion dollars without a vast staff, in effect going into the business of giving away money, yet another business you are likely to know little about.”
	At just about this point in the narrative, the questions or the incredulity begins in social circles and eventually in the media. He begins to acquire the major symbols of riches but does this without position, public holdings, or obvious paper trails. How can a person have enough money to merit increasing attention, but no clear way of having gotten it? Epstein gets stuck in that tautology. He may be rich, but he is without institutional protection or bona fides. He is a questionable substrata of wealth. He’s a freelancer.
	That’s the rub: he doesn’t work for anyone. Without institutional credentials he’s…well, nobody knows what. 
	For a period, one part of his activities he says is recovering monies for countries looted by exiled dictators or military strongmen. If early in his career he might seem like a sort of George Peppard (there’s a physical resemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s George Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.
     Then, in his telling, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy people and families. He’s not just doing their bidding or their investing, he’s helping them to navigate the ambitions of their wealth. They’ve satisfied their business dreams. Now there are the separate challenges and possibilities of their actual wealth. If they had big dreams before, it’s nothing to what they can have now. 
     In essence, as Epstein becomes more of a public figure the response to this description of his livelihood, is, in the media and in high social circles, “bullshit.” True, there is no clear alternate narrative. No one is accusing him of anything, accept, sometimes, guilt by association. (In addition to Robert Maxwell, who will be accused of fraud, there’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a New York high flyer, who went to jail for a Ponzi scheme, for whom Epstein acted as a consultant—along with, he points out, Paul Volcker.) But the characterization persist: if it’s not clear, it must be murky. Sure, Goldman Sachs partners and tech geniuses, they might have stratospheric wealth, but what to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-like no-namer? 
	In 1994, just at the moment when Prince Charles is on television acknowledging his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, Jeffrey Epstein is sitting with his arm around Princess Diana at a dinner at the Serpentine Galley in London (Diana is wearing her “revenge” dress that evening). Graydon Carter, into his second years as editor of Vanity Fair, is also at the dinner. Epstein’s rise and Carter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation, that different. Both are a function of the age of new money, both are helped by strategic relationships with the exceptionally wealthy (i.e. they are social climbers), both men have made themselves up. To say that Epstein, in the company of the Princess, sticks in Carter’s craw would be a big understatement. Epstein becomes one of the “what do you know about him” figures in Carter’s gossip trail—a story waiting to happen. A variety of the gossip that begins to circulate about Epstein—for instance, that he secretly films his guests—is seeded by Carter, who once advised me not to go to Epstein’s house or accept a ride in his car least I risk being blackmail. (“For what?” I asked Carter. “You can’t even begin to imagine,” said Carter.)
	Epstein is playing a cat and mouse game with his own growing wealth and influence. He is private and secretive, but grandly so. He joins the board of Rockefeller University. He’s suddenly on the Trilateral commission, that cabal of business people who fancy themselves, and who are fancied by conspiracy buffs, as running the world. He buys from his client Limited Founder Les Wexner the larges private house in Manhattan. (Rumors will continue for many years, that Wexner owns the house and Epstein is just squatting in it—an 18-year squat.) He buys an airplane. He buys another. He expands his holdings in New Mexico. He begins a Zanadu refurbishment of his Caribbean Island. 
     He befriends Bill Clinton in his new after-office life.
	And that’s quite the fatal pairing. 
	The post-Monica Clinton, now having pardoned the on-the-lam financier Marc Rich—at this point, before his own rehabilitation, Clinton really is the world’s ultimate sleaze ball—is suddenly being ferried around in the jet of…who exactly?
	The New York Post is the first to take formal media note of the Clinton-Epstein connection, hinting at a sex and money bromance. (“I suppose travel with Clinton changed the arc of my life,” Epstein tells me. “There were, I knew, lots of obvious reasons not to do it, but having the ability to spend 100 hours with a former president just doesn’t happen to many people.”)
     The instinctively private Epstein is not just increasingly exposed, but clearly curious about the nature of exposure. 
	I met Epstein around this time. Epstein had become a more and more active backer of advanced scientific research and in 2002 he was taking a small group of scientists out to the TED conference in Monterey. The TED organizers invited various other TED participants, including me, to join the flight. A small group assembled at the private plane terminal, most of us unfamiliar with our benefactor, and as we headed in the direction of the discrete private plans we were gently pointed to our ride: Epstein’s 727. 
	It is some thoroughly updated drawing room set-up, all of us nervously ensconced in this luxury plane, waiting for our unknown host to arrive—and soon he does, tanned, relaxed, with wide open smile, accompanied by three young women. 
     It would be unlikely, outside of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe life, that you could locate this in reality. Epstein’s attentions, taking time with each of his passengers, seemed impossible to account for. The quiet of the plane, engineered into acoustic perfection, seemed spooky. Epstein’s three companions were witty, poised, helpful as well as powerfully alluring—as though stewardesses of bygone times.
     (One more thing about this trip: Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, with their company still in its infancy, came out to see the plane on the Monterey tarmac and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran whopping from one end of the plan to the other. Then they described for Epstein, in what I can not now remember as a put on or entrepreneurial brainstorm, a brand extension in which they would market a line of Google bras with the Os as convenient cups. In fact, the name Google, they said, was invented out of the belief that men would focus on a word with two Os in it.)
	Not long after this trip, Epstein’s assistant called to invite me for tea at his house in New York, where Epstein, with what seemed to me little understanding of the subject, began to ask me about media—the upside, downside, and nature of media coverage. New York magazine was then soliciting him for a profile, as was Vanity Fair, who had assigned the British tabloid reporter, Vicki Ward, to the job.
	Both profiles—New York’s by Landon Thomas—pivot on the Clinton connection and detail the same quandary, how a man without clear institutional bona fides nevertheless achieves wealth and influence. Ward—who would more recently assert in the Daily Beast, that she was barred by Vanity Fair from writing about under-age sex evidence (a fact that could be read the other way: Vanity Fair, even looking to take down Epstein, did not find the evidence credible or supportable)—follows a rabbit hole of questionable contacts who might or might not have been the source or sources for Epstein’s wealth, but gets no closer to an answer, beyond confirming her own sense of dubiousness.
	Epstein, sensing that he might be exposing himself, tried to stop the process (Ward, often operatic about her journalistic exploits, says he threatened her), called Carter and said he was having second thoughts about being a public figure.
	 “Then you should live in a two bedroom apartment in Queens,” responded Carter.

	And then the troubles began. 
     Epstein, in man-who-can-have-everything fashion, and without the remotest sense of observance or propriety—as though a kind of cultural autism—has, for many years, ordered up a daily massage following his workout sessions.
	“Often these were massage massages,” says Epstein matter of factly, “but sometimes these were happy ending massages, especially in Palm Beach, where there are many massage parlors—‘Jack Shacks,’ they’re called—that do outcalls. There was no sex. An often there was no happy ending. Often I would be on the phone for the entire massage. There were however a lot of massages and a lot of girls, with one girl recommending others.”
	It is after Epstein’s round of publicity and widely touted association with Clinton, that the stepmother of one of the massage parlor girls, identified as “SG” in court documents, who went to Epstein’s house (most of the girls return to Epstein’s house many times) calls the police. The police interview the girl who then supplies names of other girls. Some of whom are younger than 18.
	In the end, the police track down 18 girls—nine who are under 18; the others in their 20s and 30s; one woman is in her 60s—a number of whom give statements describing scenarios not terribly different from Epstein’s description above, except each is laid out in clinical, lurid, and near-identical detail. A cold and forceful Epstein demands that unwitting juveniles (though they have come here for this very purpose) perform repulsive (or at least repulsively described) acts on him. (Although the nature of the allegations will dramatically grow into threesomes and forced sexual encounters, nobody at this point alleges anything more than Epstein masturbating.) 
	Epstein vastly raises the stakes by calling Dershowitz, who flies into Palm Beach to put the local authorities in their place—alienating Palm Beach officialdom—and, doubling down on the profile of the case, brings in Roy Black the famous criminal attorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape trial in Palm Beach.
	Here’s the narrative: the shadowy rich man, friend of the louche and disgraced President, at all times surrounded by a retinue of young and gorgeous female retainers doing his bidding, is now found to have gathered a network of wrong-side-of-the-tracks Palm Beach girls to provide him with weird sexual services. (It somehow reads weirder that he doesn’t have sex with them.) To boot, his former girl friend, Ghislaine Maxwell—the daughter of the disgraced Robert Maxwell—encouraged at least one of the girls to come to Epstein’s home (and forever more has become a fixture of further weird possibilities in this tale).
	Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter is reported to say: “This is bigger than Rush Limbaugh,” who, in a storm of publicity, has just been arrested in Palm Beach for possession of controlled drugs. 
	On one side are some of the nation’s most powerful defense attorneys (who, increasingly, seem more stumblebum than effective), on the other side, a round-up of hapless girls, with sensational tales of perversion and infamy (in the telling they are not so much sex workers, as Dickensian victims), relatively speaking giving the Palm Beach authorities the choice between utter capitulation to the powerful or standing on the side of the seemingly exploited and powerless.
	Still, with a cold eye, it also quite appears to be a straightforward tale of prostitution (however more or less kinky). And even though some of the girls are minors, age is not a distinguishing factor in a solicitation charge in Florida, nor in most places (in New York, for instance, at this time soliciting sex with anyone over the age of 14 is a class D misdemeanor calling for a $100 fine—the law has recently been changed to TK).
	In fact, the “SG” tells the police that she lied about being 18 because otherwise she knew she would not have been admitted to the house (other girls will say they knew this is what they had to say, nevertheless not stopping them from saying it).
	The local sex crimes prosecutor, Lana Belhalevic, interviews all the girls and determines that the offense is solely related to prostitution—that there are no real victims here.
     Dershowitz, with chest pounding bravado, rejects a series of lower-level plea deals and Palm Beach District Attorney Barry Krischer takes the unusual step of empanelling a grand jury, which returns with a recommendation of a single count of soliciting a prostitute—a charge without jail time. (And Epstein can apply to have his record expunged after a year.) 
     At which point, Reiter, the police chief, at odds with the District Attorney’s office, recruits the involvement of the FBI. This is of course the Bush-era FBI and Epstein presents quite the Clinton-connected scandal. Still, solicitation, even of a minor, is not a federal crime. The FBI hits on the novel interpretation that if Internet solicitation can be considered interstate commerce, so can telephone solicitation, permitting them to begin a deep dive investigation into Epstein’s friends, many of whom receive subpoenas and are threatened with prosecution.
     It’s all quite in the eye of the beholder: On the one end, Epstein is paying for sex acts (Epstein paid $200 for a massage with or without happy ending), on the other, he is abusing teenage girls. It’s a catch-22: How can a girl not old enough to vote be a prostitute? And yet, many girls not old enough to vote are prostitutes. 
     Compounding Epstein’s predicament, the world outside of his carefully constructed and controlled environment is someplace that he seems not just ill-equipped to handle but in which he seems to be blindly grouping about (i.e. he’s totally tone deaf). I visited him once during this time and found him weighing the conflicting advice of some of the most vaunted and egomaniacal lawyers (along with Dershowitz and Black, celebrity criminal attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, and Clinton prosecutor, Ken Starr) of the day—anyone with new advice, Epstein seemed to hire—as well as a catchall of the leading crisis managers, who he seemed to retain at will, all wrangling for fees and primacy. 
     Certainly, the upshot of his dealings with the Justice Department seem to involve a through-the-looking-glass logic. The government threatens to prosecute him (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and various friends, associates, and lovers, or offers what seems to be unprecedented deal in which Epstein’s lawyers (not federal prosecutors, but Epstein’s lawyers, in some ultimate act of self incrimination) have to go to the Palm Beach authorities and convince them to up the charges to an offense that will send him to jail and get him a sex offender status. Except that a solicitation charge won’t produce that result. Therefore he has to agree to a procurement or pimping charge (even though he has paid money, not received it—the sine qua non of pimping). What’s more, in a unique, if not unprecedented arrangement, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the girls who want to sue him—and, not to defend himself from their suits—forcing him to settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high 6-figure sums or more. 
     He’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13 (while Epstein is now frequently accused of somehow managing to cut short his sentence, almost all Florida prisoners serve only 70% of their officially sentenced time). 
     Jail hardly ends the legal catch all. Epstein's butler, Alfredo Rodriguez, steals and tries to sell an alleged journal or calendar with Epstein’s activities—but he tries to sell it to an undercover agent. Rodriguez is sentenced to 18 months in jail on a charge of theft and of withholding evidence (it is not so much a journal as a list of phone numbers, which were apparently collected or saved by Rod Rodriguez; all of this material was subsequently included in a court filing by Edwards). Scott Rothstein, a lawyer whose firm represented additional girls in their suits against Epstein, also goes to jail for recruiting investors to pay for these suits on the fraudulent basis that settlements had already been reached. It’s the largest fraud in Florida history and Rothstein receives a 50-year sentence. 
     Then, Brad Edwards, Rothstein’s former partner, sues the federal government in 2008 for abridging the rights of two of the original complainants under the Crime Victim Rights Act (giving victims the right to be consulted about the disposition of their cases) regarding the Justice Departments agreement not to prosecute in favor of the state action. In 2014, Edwards tries to ad Virginia Roberts, another of the original complainants, who has previously settled with Epstein, to the long-running suit. Roberts who was paid a settlement under the original terms of Epstein’s agreement—that he would pay attorney’s fees and not oppose any law suits against him—is now trying to overturn the agreement under which she was paid, and, with Edwards, further suing Epstein for $50,000,000.
     Indeed, Roberts, with the Daily Mail being her prime outlet, emerges as the most vocal accuser—and, in fact, the some total of the current story and attention. 
     That is, there is no story without her and what is being billed as her  memoir of her “sex slavery” with Epstein, written ten years after the fact. Along with the Dershowitz and Prince Andrew charges, Roberts puts, with rather some narrative detail, both Clinton and Al and Tipper Gore on the island—and in fact Clinton, apparently with the acquiescence of the Secret Service, flying in a helicopter piloted by Epstein’s girlfriend, an amateur pilot. Epstein’s lawyers say that not only have Clinton and the Gores never been to the Epstein Island, but that there is easy proof of this in secret service records, which would seem to make the memoir opportunistic or hallucinatory fiction. 
     The FBI, in a recent filing, has argued that Roberts should not be party to the suit against the government because she refused to cooperate with the government in its investigation in 2007, hence has no standing as a victim. (At the same time, the FBI included her on the list of 40 victims with whom it mandated Epstein reach a settlement.)
     It is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers then in Epstein’s case. 
     Edwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton, Donald Trump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly from the original Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about Epstein.
     In addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to Epstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton takes on a new role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or imagined, to Epstein and sex slaves.
     Almost everybody identified in any story about Epstein is approached by other media seeking to write about Epstein, often with financial incentives.
     No new stories or even new details emerge. Every aspect of the current story is based on court filings describing events that may or may not have taken place prior to 2007. It’s as though a kind of ground-hog day of moral opprobrium, a desire to repeat and to savor a new the old details.
     A recent Reuters story identified a charity that Epstein has not given money to in 15 years that said if he does give again, they would give it back.
     
     The world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure walls and the Mail and social media and upholders of new norms ever more incredulous and apoplectic that Epstein not only walks free but prospers too. 	Although he has spent more than a year in jail and paid out what may be as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have gotten away with it—that worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute badness: the financier whose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather than work; a rich middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent Playboy in a correct and prudish world—someone who somehow didn’t get the memo about vast changes in mores and culture.  
     When I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus would be to get married, he said he’d rather go back to jail.
     He is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.
     This is all, of course, a Gatsby-like tale: An enigmatic, and strangely appealing figure, able to invent and inhabit his own world is a mystery to try to decipher. Of course Gatsby in New York Post and Daily Mail parlance would likely be just a freaky financier too.
     And this story is, in its way, about the limitation of journalism, in which the most compelling parts of the tale—Epstein’s ambitions and impulses would be well suited to a long running cable drama—need to be sacrificed not just to moral certainty but to a rather preposterous fantasy of moral certainty.
     Anyway, I hope I get invited back to Jeffrey’s house soon.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023898.txt,"152 Teaching Minds

It is not an unreasonable question to ask whether being a USS.
senator prepares you to be president. It would not have been odd if
Palin had asked Couric whether we ever had a president who actually
was prepared for the job. Other than vice presidents who work closely
with a president for 4 years or more, it is not unreasonable to assert
that we have a history of unprepared presidents. But she didn’t say
that because preparedness is a causative notion and Palin doesn’t seem
to get causation. She may be bright enough to have been taught about
causation when she was small, but apparently this didn’t happen. As a
result, she seems stupid to those who do understand causation.

Palin recently has made statements that make you wonder where
her ideas about causation come from. This is from a 2009 interview
on ABC:

Walters: Now let’s talk about some issues—the Middle East. The
Obama Administration does not want Israel to build any
more settlements on what they consider Palestinian territory.
What is your view on this?

Palin: I disagree with the Obama Administration on that. I
believe that, um, the Jewish settlements should be allowed to
be expanded upon because the population of Israel is going
to grow. More and more Jewish people will be flocking to
Israel in the days and weeks and months ahead.

What is the problem here? Again, there is a question of causation, but
it is more obvious that that is the issue. No one who hears this state-
ment would fail to ask why Jews would be flocking to Israel in the
weeks and months ahead.

It is important to understand that determination of causation is
the backbone of an intelligently thought out belief system. People be-
lieve certain things. They believe that the sun will rise in the morning
and that their parents will come home from work at night. Beliefs
often are based on observation and generalization. People also are
taught beliefs. There are many ways to acquire beliefs. Children get
them from their parents mostly but also from friends and siblings.
At some point, however, reality comes into play. Reality often means
comparing a belief with what you know or can figure out about causa-
tion. You can believe that the sun rises each morning but not know its
cause. And, of course, you can learn the cause. You can believe that the

Jeffrey, 
Peggy's story is attached to the e-mail. I have included the story in the body of the e-mail as well. 
Thanks, 
Stephanie 
Omar Quadhafi is hunkering down in Tripoli giving press interviews denying that rebels are taking over 
Eastern Libya. Oil prices are shooting over one hundred dollars a barrel. The US government is on the 
verge of a shut down. These are not the top secret opening lines to Aaron Sorkin's new script, but the 
global headlines of a world spinning out of control. I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to 
attend the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat. 
For the second year nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle is down to two. 
The beloved timeless classic, The King's Speech marches into the arena as the front runner, but 
passionate supporters of the brilliant edgier (and critics darling) The Social Network have not 
conceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Filmmakers 
are exhausted from campaigning. 
At Bryan Lourd's famous star studded party Sony Classics' Co-President Michael Barker announces to me he 
has taken a random sampling of voters in the room. He says, There will be a 'Social Network' upset at 
the Kodak Theater. Shear panic radiates from my every pore as he says, I am joking. It's like color 
war at summer camp. 
Woody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists 
against each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. 
My event and publicity company is considered Switzerland by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to 
present and position his work. This year I am somewhat emotionally sucked in. 
In 2005 I meet the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO,Elizabeth 
I. The Emmy award winning movie stars Helen Mirren, who takes credit for discovering him directing 
English television. Helen later wins her Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen 
Elizabeth is the daughter of King George VI portrayed by Oscar winner Colin Firth in The King's Speech. 
I also become Hooper's champion encouraging many to see his early work including his herculean 10 hour 
HBO mini-series John Adams produced by Tom Hanks. 
Six years later at the Telluride Film Festival Tom Hooper is bathing in the glory of a hysterical 
standing ovation with Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first screening of The King's Speech. 
Surprisingly, this drama's subtle humor gets big laughs leading up to its emotional ending. 
Within two weeks, at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein is now standing with his filmmakers 
witnessing the same reaction. The film wins The Audience Prize. Their strategy is to say nothing. Do 
nothing. They have a possible Oscar winner. Four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in 
Toronto. 
Cut to New York City at the end of September. It's the opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln 
Center. One of America's most important and prolific producers Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, 
Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical 
audience who have just seen The Social Network. 
The film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making The Girl 
with the Dragon Tattoo. Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for an Oscar. 
The Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, 
where cool Yale/NYU student James Franco appears and receives a heroic standing ovation. More Oscar buzz. 
Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and even Harvey Weinstein 
slip in the back. Darren Aronofsky, sporting the ever present cool wool scarf around his neck is hailed a 
genius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012685 
Both films are sensational and movie goers go nuts, but it is The King's Speech that edges out the 
competition for The Audience Prize. 
Mid-November David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg, working together for the third time, sneak The Fighter 
in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, Clint Eastwood is 
going to kill himself for not directing this. Wahlberg says, You are wrong. He turned it down because 
he's done it. He has seen it and he loves it. I instantly lavish my affection and praise on David O. 
Russell, who becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting 
actors to beat. 
True Grit directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin doesn't premiere till mid-
December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box 
office gold. 
This is the year many of the 78 million Baby Boomers go back to the theaters. Five small budget 
independent films become surprise hits as each exceeds $100 million 
The Social Network now cements its battle cry with one word; relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the 
cover of Time Magazine as The Person of the Year. A smart and extensive ad campaign positions the film in 
the lead. Critics and pundits proclaim the race is over. The Social Network is the clear winner. 
Everyone goes on holiday. 
This is probably the only time in Harvey Weinstein's life that he is caught off guard. He quickly 
mobilizes an inner team of 15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including Christmas. They 
become like a Chinese Restaurant...always open. A generational war is in full swing. Harvey screens his 
film for the older voters. Everything is done by the books. Budgets are limited. He sends screenwriter 
David Seidler and Tom H000per to every corner of the country doing q+a's till they are blue in the face 
from finding their voice. SAG voters begin seeing the film 2 and 3 times. 
In January the Golden Globes voted on by about 88 foreign journalists gives Best Drama to The Social 
Network, Best Director to David Fincher and Best Screenplay to Aaron Sorkin. Their film is still 
perceived as the Oscar winner. 
Team Weinstein underestimates their hard work and is in shock when The King's Speech wins the PGA in 
L.A. Harvey doesn't even attend and is working in Sundance. They are equally surprised when Tom Hooper 
wins the DGA and the actors win the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced the lead. They are now the front 
runner. It takes the media a few weeks to catch on. 
The Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of The 
King's Speech and is moved by the film. With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, the 
Weinstein Company sends out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. They also 
acknowledge Prime Minister David Cameron's private Christmas screening. 
On Oscar night, it isn't until Hilary Swank surprisingly yells out Hooper's name for Best Director that 
Harvey's gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture. The King has spoken. 
Friday, February 24th 
Mid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel, where I have stayed for thirty years. As the housekeepers 
unpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge and find icon Warren Beatty in a booth. He motions me 
over to meet an Egyptian fashion editor from Cairo. I say, Warren, you are a little late to visit 
Cairo. I tell him I'm rooting for Annette and love her film The Kids Are All Right. Warren tells me 
The Social Network will win. 
This year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I am now shown to a very very very small room, 
the size of a broom closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am moved. The housekeepers 
run down the hall with my clothes flying. I calm down. The hotel is sold out. I get someone else's room. 
Another poor schmuck checking in downstairs will get the broom closet. 
It is cold, grey and rainy. Taffata, organdy and embroidered silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I 
stay in my sweaters and fur coat and head to Arianna Huffington's Mediterranean house in Beverly Hills 
where Wendi Murdoch and Arianna are hosting a party for Tom Freston's wife, the beautiful blond Kathy. 
The book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World. A perfect book for Monks. 
Arianna has just sold the Huffington Post for to AOL to $315 million dollars and rumored to have 
personally landed around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the 
door. Other drenched power players ushered in under umbrellas include Disney's Bob Iger and wife Willow 
Bay, Fox's Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter Chloe Malle, Google's Eric Schmidt, 
Oliver Stone avoiding questions about Charlie Sheen and escorting his daughter Tara, Moby, Jamie Niven, 
Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, Tracey Ullman, CBS's Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount's Brad 
Grey and fiancé Cassandra Marc and Jeff Bezos. Hors d'oeuvres include pigs in blankets, a food group not 
mentioned in Kathy's book.

The party action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus's home in the neighborhood for True Grit's Ethan and Joel 
Coen. I pass Ron Howard on the way in and he says, Keep me on your list. Is he kidding? Sunrise and 
Mark Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, Focus Feature's James Shamus, Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable 
Hallie Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up with Justin Bieber. She giggles, 
Peg, I am only 14. 
Hunky Josh Brolin tells me he is coming to New York in March to shoot two new films. He is working on 
producing and starring in The Hunchback of Notre Dame with Tim Burton as a future project. 
I am now inches away, face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him I love him in Morning 
Glory. He is looking at me in utter disbelief and I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is also inches away 
in a hat, glasses, jacket, layered sweater and scarves. I whisper to Harrison, That looks just like 
Johnny Depp. Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend Johnny Depp. I babel a 
bit about his great work and run for cover to a corner next to my buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer. Jerry 
introduces me to the wives, Vanessa Paradis and Calista Flockhart I bore them with girly chit-chat and 
realize it's time to get out of there. 
I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd Friday Night Party. Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a 
traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. Cell phones do not work. The world's most 
famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. 
Bryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the door all night. Inside Uma tells me she finally moved 
into a doorman building in New York after being terrorized by stalkers for years. Talented, Ben Walker 
talks about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter he is about to shoot as his fiancé Mamie Gummer looks sexy 
shivering in a white satin gown. Producer Jon Kilik mentions he oversees a new cut of Julian Schnabel's 
Miral to be released in March. Bennett Miller, standing with Kristin Gore says Sony loves his new film 
Moneyball and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not terrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an 
actual job decorating Jeffrey Katzenberg's home and he has never been happier. I congratulate Barry 
Levinson's son, Sam, a director, for winning the writing award at Sundance for his first film, Another 
Happy Day which is inspired by his family. 
Also seen floating around are, Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal, but not together, Sean Penn, Tom Curise 
and Katie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa, Carrie Fisher, Bruce Weber, Sean Combs, Paul 
Haggis, Marisa Tomei, Jay Roach, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard

Gonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen Barkin who is headed to Broadway in The Normal 
Heart this spring and CAA's Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda Queally. 
Busy Bruce Cohen who is producing Sunday's awards broadcast tries to get his car to leave. Limo lock is 
at a standstill. Nothing is moving outside. Two hundred swells become party prisoners and resign to just 
having an absolute ball till 5:00am. Once again, this is the most star studded party in town. 
Saturday, February 26th, 2011 
The sun comes up and dries up all the land. IAC chairmen and owner of The Newsweek/Daily Beast Barry 
Diller and his designer wife Diane Von Furstenberg host their annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their 
Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Governor Jerry Brown, just elected to his 
third (nonconsecutive) term as California Governor. Diane's children, Alex and Tatiana, along with their 
children comprise three generations of guests, which makes this party so special. 
Like last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic 
tables covered with yellow flowers sit on oriental rugs, covering the soggy ground. Terrines of hot soup, 
platters of sausages, fried chicken and salads are beautifully arranged on an endless buffet. Everyone 
wears winter clothes; comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive in a fur coat. 
Barry and Diane's loyal friends have been coming to this party for over fifteen years. Everybody knows 
everybody and it doesn't matter if you have a hit film or TV show this season. Oprah Winfrey kisses David 
Geffen, casually chats with former Disney CEO Michael Eisner and current Sony chief Sir Howard Stringer. 
Brett Ratner arrives with his house guest Jean Pigozzi who is allowed to photograph everyone. Graydon 
greets people with wife Anna and Fran Lebowitz by his side. 
Ingrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch, Ron Meyer, Bryan Lourd Francesco Clemente with his twin 
boys and Tom Ford chat each other up. People watching include the pregnant Victoria and David Beckham 
with Lynn Wyatt, Liv Tyler, Vincent Gallo, Eva Longoria, Larry Gagosian and Shala Monroque, Ben 
Silverman, Debbie and Allen Grubman, Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer 
wearing her oversized cat glasses. 
Bruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast rehearsal. This is a special honor. There are metal 
barricades leading up to the credentials trailer. High-tech security includes photos and computer 
background checks. The only thing they don't do is pat me down and ask for fingerprints. Once inside the 
Kodak Theater's massive auditorium, I find a seat next to Bruce's proud parents. I watch Josh Brolin and 
Javier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best 
Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Screenplay. Josh later told me at The Night Before Party that their 
acting methods are completely opposite. Josh says he is a quick study and is very creative and 
comfortable ad-libbing. Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, needs to have every syllable printed out, 
which he studies with a dialect coach. Little wiggle room for jokes. Life size photos on large cardboard 
plaques are taped to each nominee's chair. I try to memorize their location, so when I return Sunday I 
can quickly kiss them all. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012687 
Back at the Beverly Hills hotel, I slip into my gorgeous black tulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a 
plunging neck line and put on my mother's jewels. Jim Coleman takes me the Night Before Party in the 
hotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg's, 9th Annual A-lister event benefiting The Motion Picture & Television 
Fund where they raise $6.5 million dollars in one night. I walk right into Valentino who gives me the 
once over and approves my outfit. I tell him and Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen's new film, 
Midnight in Paris is opening the Cannes Film Festival and they must bring the yacht. Woody is also 
filming all summer in Rome and I am counting on them to entertain him. 
Elton John and David Furnish join our conversation and of course we ask for intimate details about the 
new baby. Elton says this is the first time they have been away from him for more than a night and they 
are delirious with parenthood. I segway over to Amy Adams who mentions she also hates leaving her baby in 
the hotel room. I tell her she's acted like a lady with all the attention showered on Melissa Leo and 
that someday soon she will win an Oscar because she consistently hands in amazing performances and 
everybody loves her. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg's 
god-daughter Gwyneth Paltrow. Kate gushes as she talks about her two grandchildren from daughter Jessica. 
I have known Steven since I Wanna Hold Your Hand. In 1982, as a young publicist on E.T. I moved to 
California to work for him as one of his thirteen assistants. I now tell him I'm going to Broadway 
opening of War Horse with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to see his movie version. He 
is wildly excited about the film. I beg him to work on it. 
I meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new hair cut and her perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret 
is a half hour on the treadmill every day. Somehow I think that's an understatement. I tell Jesse 
Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week. He was hiding under his hoodie and I knew 
not to bother him. He said innocently, You should have said 'Hello'. I always cover my head because I 
think my curls make me look like a girl. 
The charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at various booths for cheap clothing, new iPads, make-
up, chocolates, shampoo and a $50 dollar Arch gift card for free McDonalds hamburgers. A bargain is a 
bargain, rich people run around like lunatics, collecting gifts for their housekeepers. Among the 
shoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom's Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine 
Taylor and Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchette, Susan and Robert Downey,Jr., and Debra and Hugh Jackman. 
Next stop is The Weinstein Company's Pre-Oscar party at the Soho House, sponsored by MontBlanc, 
celebrating their new charity partnership and $1 million dollar donation to the Princess Grace 
Foundation-USA. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night parties where nominees spoofed their own 
films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. Grown men would dress as Anna Paquin and play 
the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award. 
There is social anxiety at the Soho House garage entrance. Guests patiently wait as super stars whisk by. 
A four hundred pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator until I spot Benny Medina. Once on, I see 
the radiant Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik's yacht in Cannes. She 
graciously pretends to know me. Her manager, Benny Medina is kicking me. 
I slip into Colin Firth's booth by the front bar to have a tete-a-tete with him and his wife Livia 
Giuggioli about tomorrow night. Jokingly, I suggest when he wins to say, I'm speechless. Colin 
patiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, have already mentioned this. He then says that 
others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, 
assuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older models 
as Ford only designs classics. I tell him I made director Charles Ferguson, front runner for the 
financial documentary Inside Job spend $6,000 dollars last week for a new Tom Ford tuxedo. 
In the back room Jennifer Lopez is now seated with Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman. Nominee Helena 
Bonham Carter, her husband Tim Burton and her mother Elena circulate. Celebs have now drifted over from 
The Night Before Party. The star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, 
Camilla Belle, Chace Crawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren Aronofsky, Emma Stone, Jaime Foxx, 
director John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers Morgan, Rachel Zoe, Russell Simmons, Sean Parker, Sir Ben 
Kingsly, Zack Braff , Michelle Williams and Leonardo Dicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. Speech filmmakers are 
functioning on high anxiety. 
Sunday, February 27th, 2011 
Producer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater 
at 3:00pm and nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we arrive at the world's most 
famous red carpet, I guide Donna through the extreme right security check-in to make sure we mingle with 
the nominees and get on camera. I teach her the red carpet hustle which is five steps forward, three 
steps back and one inch behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Bryan Lourd as Sandra Bullock is talking 
to ABC-TV and a billion people see me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three steps 
back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow. As I hook up the back of her dress another billion people see us 
correcting a fashion malfunction. Once again, five steps forward and three steps back. We are now posing 
for the still cameras between Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Our handbags begin buzzing. Countless 
friends are e-mailing us that they just saw us on television. 
James Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip and energetic hosts. The film montages are always the best and the 
set looks great. This is the year of no surprises. Sorkin, Seidler, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, Natalie 
Portman and Colin Firth are totally prepared to receive the gold. Tom Hooper's win leads into Best 
Picture. Harvey is now sitting in Spielberg's seats as Spielberg announces the win. Six months of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012688 
grueling work have finally paid off. King George VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a 
single man who triumphs over adversity. 
The Governor's ball, held above the Kodak Theater, recreates the Mocambo-Ciro's niteries of the 1930's 
and 40's, using a palette of teal and white. Three bands alternate musical styles as hungry guests wolf 
down Wolfgang Puck's delicious food. The winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy 
eight pound gold statues. 
An hour later there is a migration to the famous Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at the Sunset 
Tower Hotel owned by Jeff Klein. One celebrity after another poses in front of the green hedge standing 
in the middle of the circular Vanity Fair logo to record their devotion and support to Graydon and the 
magazine. 
There's a hierarchy of arrival times. The inner circle of Graydon's 150 best friends attend a seated 
dinner and viewing of the show at 5pm. They include Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg, Francis Ford 
Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Tom Ford, Sandy 
Gallin, Mitch Glazer and Kelly Lynch, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L'Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, 
Naomi Watts and Live Schreiber, Wendi Stark, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, George Hammilton, 
Donna Karan and Steve Martin. 
The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9pm. They are Justin Bieber and his date Selena 
Gomez, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Vera Farmiga, Armie Hammer, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Spacey, Charlize 
Theron, Anne Hathaway, Hailee Steinfield,Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Michelle 
Williams, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Jane Fonda after her play, 33 Variations, Melania and 
Donald Trump whom I introduce to David 0. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about The Fighter. Donald 
offers me a ride home on his plane. He is leaving in ten minutes. Too bad James Franco didn't know 
because he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after party. 
Social standings of the rest of the guests are determined by half hour increments. Every other person 
previously mentioned in the story is here. VF's Beth Kseniak and Matt Ullian tell me the list is cut down 
to 800 this year. 
At 11:30pm there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary's house. One 
should note that earlier in the evening Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risque outfit with 
daughter Lourdes in front of the green hedge. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the creme 
de la creme with the promise of fabulous music, dancing and no cameras. Those reported on their dance 
floor include Ryan Phillippe with Amanda Syedfried, who were making out all night and Phillippe's ex-wife 
Reese Witherspoon and new fiancé Jim Toth. They pregnant Natalie Portman and choreographer Benjamin 
Millepied, Mick Jagger, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Ralph Feinnes, Mila Kunis, Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow 
and Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper boogie til dawn. 
A winner's work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper and David Seidler show up at 4:30am at The Four 
Seasons Hotel for a live broadcast on The Today Show with Meredith Vieira. Functioning on an adrenalin 
rush, they are back at the Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah's live broadcast. Leave it 
to Oprah to get the king's last words.

And Trump says, “Yeah, but what’s in
it for me?”
(laughter)

There’s an old saying in psychology.
In order to deceive people, you have
to deceive yourself. Here’s the thing:
Trump has instant belief. He just be-
lieves whatever he says. With Obama’s
birth certificate controversy, he would
believe it, even though he had to know
it wasn’t true. Then, he said he’d hired
investigators to $0 to Hawaii.

EP: (embarrassed for history) | remem-
ber that.

PK: I think that was a lie, too! I don’t think
he ever sent them. Or, if he did

PK: The epitome of it, regarding coverage
of Trump, was CEO Leslie Moonves, who
said “It may not be good for America, but
it’s damn good for CBS!”

EP: You know, the week Trump won, to
deal with shock, my mind started re-
membering things that made me laugh.
One of your stories showed up: The one
when you met Bob Dylan and asked for
his opinion about the Holocaust.

PK: | was at a radio show. And he was
watching in the room. It was me, Abbie
Hoffman, a rabbi, and some others.
During the panel, the Holocaust was
integrated into the dialogue. Dylan was
there watching, sitting in a dark corner in

ternative facts”? It was such a bizarre
oxymoron, he couldn't stop laughing.
EP: My favorite one of her’s is the Bowling
Green Massacre. The Internet was hilari-
ous on that. For the Holocaust, of course,
it’s “Never Forget”; so, for the Bowling
Green Massacre, people were posting
pictures of green bowling balls, with the
phrase “Never Remember”.

PK: Oh, that’s good. It’s like what I was
mentioning about optimism. The answer
is what we saw right after the inaugura-
tion, with the march and the rallies.
Trump is essentially the monster we’ve
created. Whereas Frankenstein was
made from corpses, Trump was made
from fringe subcultures: First

send them, and they didn’t find
any “evidence,” then he lied by
omission...of facts.

EP: | wonder if these lies are
going to have consequences —
if impeachment will happen.
Getting Congress to do it will
be nearly impossible.

PE: There’s little hints that
the Republicans — their con-
science is gettin ‘em. Those are
my hopes.

EP: The fear I have is we're going
to lose this country through this
motherfucker. That we're going
to have a police state — that we
won't have a free press. Do you
think these are real fears?

PK: Oh, yeah. Well, you know,
a police state has a bad reputa-

el

from the white supremacists
.. Trump was on the radio
with some insane conspiracy
theorist, and the host said, “My
listeners, they really love you.”
Trump then went to the Evan-
gelists, ‘cause that was another
subculture. He couldn’t think
of anything, the first time, from
the Bible. Next time, though,
he brought a Bible with him.
He was smart enough to take
the cellophane off it.
EP: | think for the most part,
you've always been on the
right side of history, actions
you've taken and _ political/
moral positions — everything
from civil rights, to women’s
rights, to drug freedom. But I

tion. I mean, cops love it!

The thing is — ever since I
took a lot of acid — I have become an
over-doer of being optimistic. You can
pick your metaphor, but I think Trump’s
a blessing in disguise.

With these scares, he’s the monster —
The Frankenstein — that we’ve created.
It’s from the country’s dumbing-down
of the media. Especially with the com-
mercials. You know, when they first had
TV news, they didn’t have commercials.
EP: I’ve been trying to get more into the
habit of watching PBS News Hour. It’s
amazing to have a full hour of commer-
cial-free news, and not looping news,
like CNN. What’s sad is I find I have to
build up the stamina for it. I actually find
myself wanting commercial breaks. PBS
had less coverage of Trump’s campaign,
too. Probably because there were no ads
to sell.

the back of the room. When the program
was over, he walked up and said to me,
“You didn’t say much.” And I thought
that was funny, because he was such a
minimalist.

Then I held up my fist, like a micro-
phone, and asked, “So, what do you think
about the Holocaust?” He offered his
minimalistic reply: “I resent it.”

EP: That’s just too good a joke.

PK: I remember that, more than the radio
panel, because it had such an essence
of itself.

EP: That’s the benefit of minimalism,
right? It’s like these insane Trump tweets.
In some way, they’re stronger because
they’re just 140 characters.

Cooper laugh for five minutes when
Kellyanne Conway used the phrase “al-

don’t know how you decided
to do some of this shit. For
example, you ran an abortion referral
service inside The Realist. No reward
beyond a moral victory.
PK: Back then, when it was illegal, people
thought doctors who performed abortions
should be arrested and convicted.
EP: Let’s discuss the development of your
ethics. What’s your internal compass?
Have you always had these instincts?
PK: It happens organically. I remember
when LOOK Magazine said about abor-

all of them are just in it for the money.”
And I knew of one: Doctor Spencer in
Ashland, Pennsylvania. He had a reputa-

The phone rang in our apartment in Palo Alto at 4:30 in the morning. We had
been in the US for barely six weeks. It was the Sixth of October 1973: Yom
Kippur, the holiest date on the Jewish calendar. I was still a bit groggy from the
night before. We had been out at a get-to-know-you event for some of the
several dozen Israelis, and several hundred American Jewish students, at
Stanford. While I only vaguely recognized the voice on the other end of the line,
her words instantly jolted me awake: “The boss is busy,” she said. “But he
wants you to know. A war has started back home.”

Her boss was Motta Gur, who was by now Israel’s military attaché in
Washington and was my nominal commander for my period in the United
States. “I need to talk to Motta,” I said. She passed him the phone. “I want you
to know I’m going back,” I told him. Motta’s reply took my mind back 15
months, to our on-again-off-again mission to abduct the Syrian officers, with
Motta and Dado in the command post, intent on reining in the “young bulls” of
the sayeret. “Ehud,” he said, “from what I’m hearing, I don’t think we are
missing a major war.”

“What’s this we?” I said. Motta was a general, at the upper reaches of the
armed forces, officially posted to Washington. I was a young officer, just
starting to work my way up the chain of field command. “I can’t afford to miss
even a non-major war,” I said. “Pll check in with you when I get to New York.”

“Major” would turn out to be, if anything, an understatement. Yet all I knew,
as I kissed Nava and Michal goodbye and got a cab to San Francisco airport,
was that Israel was again at war. By the time I joined the swarm of Israelis
around the El Al desk at Kennedy eight hours later, the picture was clearer, and
more worrying with each new report from back home. Surprise attacks by Syria
and Egypt — armies we’d not just defeated, but humiliated, six years earlier —
had pinned down and pushed back our forces on the Golan Heights and in the
Sinai. Without any advance call-up, many reservists were only now reaching the
front lines.

As hundreds of people pressed for seats on the El Al flight, I was fortunate to
receive a boost up the pecking order from another man in line. Since the Sabena
operation, the existence of Sayeret Matkal had become a bit less secret. Still, the
identity of the sayeret commander was known to just a few people outside the
unit. So skittish were the army security people that before I’d left for Stanford,

The New Cold War 

Bill Spindle and Margaret Coker 



APRIL 16, 2011 -- For three months, the Arab world has been awash in protests and demonstrations. It's being called an Arab Spring, harking back to the Prague Spring of 1968.

But comparison to the short-lived flowering of protests 40 years ago in Czechoslovakia is turning out to be apt in another way. For all the attention the Mideast protests have received, their most notable impact on the region thus far hasn't been an upswell of democracy. It has been a dramatic spike in tensions between two geopolitical titans, Iran and Saudi Arabia.

This new Middle East cold war comes complete with its own spy-versus-spy intrigues, disinformation campaigns, shadowy proxy forces, supercharged state rhetoric—and very high stakes.

The cold war is a reality, says one senior Saudi official. Iran is looking to expand its influence. This instability over the last few months means that we don't have the luxury of sitting back and watching events unfold.

On March 14, the Saudis rolled tanks and troops across a causeway into the island kingdom of Bahrain. The ruling family there, long a close Saudi ally, appealed for assistance in dealing with increasingly large protests. Iran soon rattled its own sabers. Iranian parliamentarian Ruhollah Hosseinian urged the Islamic Republic to put its military forces on high alert, reported the website for Press TV, the state-run English-language news agency. I believe that the Iranian government should not be reluctant to prepare the country's military forces at a time that Saudi Arabia has dispatched its troops to Bahrain, he was quoted as saying. 

The intensified wrangling across the Persian—or, as the Saudis insist, the Arabian—Gulf has strained relations between the U.S. and important Arab allies, helped to push oil prices into triple digits and tempered U.S. support for some of the popular democracy movements in the Arab world. Indeed, the first casualty of the Gulf showdown has been two of the liveliest democracy movements in countries right on the fault line, Bahrain and the turbulent frontier state of Yemen. But many worry that the toll could wind up much worse if tensions continue to ratchet upward. They see a heightened possibility of actual military conflict in the Gulf, where one-fifth of the world's oil supplies traverse the shipping lanes between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Growing hostility between the two countries could make it more difficult for the U.S. to exit smoothly from Iraq this year, as planned. And, perhaps most dire, it could exacerbate what many fear is a looming nuclear arms race in the region.

Iran has long pursued a nuclear program that it insists is solely for the peaceful purpose of generating power, but which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia believe is really aimed at producing a nuclear weapon. At a recent security conference, Prince Turki al Faisal, a former head of the Saudi intelligence service and ambassador to the U.K. and the U.S., pointedly suggested that if Iran were to develop a weapon, Saudi Arabia might well feel pressure to develop one of its own.

The Saudis currently rely on the U.S. nuclear umbrella and on antimissile defense systems deployed throughout the Persian Gulf region. The defense systems are intended to intercept Iranian ballistic missiles that could be used to deliver nuclear warheads. Yet even Saudis who virulently hate Iran have a hard time believing that the Islamic Republic would launch a nuclear attack against the birthplace of their prophet and their religion. The Iranian leadership says it has renounced the use of nuclear weapons. 

How a string of hopeful popular protests has brought about a showdown of regional superpowers is a tale as convoluted as the alliances and history of the region. It shows how easily the old Middle East, marked by sectarian divides and ingrained rivalries, can re-emerge and stop change in its tracks.

There has long been bad blood between the Saudis and Iran. Saudi Arabia is a Sunni Muslim kingdom of ethnic Arabs, Iran a Shiite Islamic republic populated by ethnic Persians. Shiites first broke with Sunnis over the line of succession after the death of the Prophet Mohammed in the year 632; Sunnis have regarded them as a heretical sect ever since. Arabs and Persians, along with many others, have vied for the land and resources of the Middle East for almost as long.

These days, geopolitics also plays a role. The two sides have assembled loosely allied camps. Iran holds in its sway Syria and the militant Arab groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories; in the Saudi sphere are the Sunni Muslim-led Gulf monarchies, Egypt, Morocco and the other main Palestinian faction, Fatah. The Saudi camp is pro-Western and leans toward tolerating the state of Israel. The Iranian grouping thrives on its reputation in the region as a scrappy resistance camp, defiantly opposed to the West and Israel.

For decades, the two sides have carried out a complicated game of moves and countermoves. With few exceptions, both prefer to work through proxy politicians and covertly funded militias, as they famously did during the long Lebanese civil war in the late 1970s and 1980s, when Iran helped to hatch Hezbollah among the Shiites while the Saudis backed Sunni militias. 

But the maneuvering extends far beyond the well-worn battleground of Lebanon. Two years ago, the Saudis discovered Iranian efforts to spread Shiite doctrine in Morocco and to use some mosques in the country as a base for similar efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. After Saudi emissaries delivered this information to King Hassan II, Morocco angrily severed diplomatic relations with Iran, according to Saudi officials and cables obtained by the organization WikiLeaks.

As far away as Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, the Saudis have watched warily as Iranian clerics have expanded their activities—and they have responded with large-scale religious programs of their own there. The 1979 Iranian revolution was a major eruption that still looms large in the psyches of both nations. It explicitly married Shiite religious zeal with historic Persian ambitions and also played on sharply anti-Western sentiments in the region. 

Iran's clerical regime worked to spread the revolution across the Middle East; Saudi Arabia and its allies worried that it would succeed. For a time it looked like it might. There were large demonstrations and purported antigovernment plots in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, which has a large population of Shiite Muslim Arabs, and in Bahrain, where Shiites are a distinct majority and Iran had claimed sovereignty as recently as 1970.

The protests that began this past January in Tunisia had nothing to do with any of this. They started when a struggling street vendor in that country's desolate heartland publicly set himself on fire after a local officer cited his cart for a municipal violation. His frustration, multiplied hundreds of thousands times, boiled over in a month of demonstrations against Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. To the amazement of the Arab world, Mr. Ben Ali fled the country when the military declined to back him by brutally putting down the demonstrations.

Spurred on by televised images and YouTube videos from Tunisia, protests broke out across much of the rest of the Arab world. Within weeks, millions were on the streets in Egypt and Hosni Mubarak was gone, shown the door in part by his longtime backer, the U.S. government. The Obama administration was captivated by this spontaneous outbreak of democratic demands and at first welcomed it with few reservations. In Riyadh, Saudi officials watched with alarm. They became furious when the Obama administration betrayed, to Saudi thinking, a longtime ally in Mr. Mubarak and urged him to step down in the face of the street demonstrations. 

The Egyptian leader represented a key bulwark in what Riyadh perceives as a great Sunni wall standing against an expansionist Iran. One part of that barrier had already crumbled in 2003 when the U.S. invasion of Iraq toppled Saddam Hussein. Losing Mr. Mubarak means that the Saudis now see themselves as the last Sunni giant left in the region. 

The Saudis were further agitated when the protests crept closer to their own borders. In Yemen, on their southern flank, young protesters were suddenly rallying thousands, and then tens of thousands, of their fellow citizens to demand the ouster of the regime, led by President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family for 43 years. 

Meanwhile, across a narrow expanse of water on Saudi Arabia's northeast border, protesters in Bahrain rallied in the hundreds of thousands around a central roundabout in Manama. Most Bahraini demonstrators were Shiites with a long list of grievances over widespread economic and political discrimination. But some Sunnis also participated, demanding more say in a government dominated by the Al-Khalifa family since the 18th century.

Protesters deny that their goals had anything to do with gaining sectarian advantage. Independent observers, including the U.S. government, saw no sign that the protests were anything but homegrown movements arising from local problems. During a visit to Bahrain, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates urged the government to adopt genuine political and social reform.

But to the Saudis, the rising disorder on their borders fit a pattern of Iranian meddling. A year earlier, they were convinced that Iran was stoking a rebellion in Yemen's north among a Shiite-dominated rebel group known as the Houthis. Few outside observers saw extensive ties between Iran and the Houthis. But the Saudis nonetheless viewed the nationwide Yemeni protests in that context. In Bahrain, where many Shiites openly nurture cultural and religious ties to Iran, the Saudis saw the case as even more open-and-shut. To their ears, these suspicions were confirmed when many Bahraini protesters moved beyond demands for greater political and economic participation and began demanding a constitutional monarchy or even the outright ouster of the Al-Khalifa family. Many protesters saw these as reasonable responses to years of empty promises to give the majority Shiites a real share of power—and to the vicious government crackdown that had killed seven demonstrators to that point. 

But to the Saudis, not to mention Bahrain's ruling family, even the occasional appearance of posters of Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah amid crowds of Shiite protesters pumping their fists and chanting demands for regime change was too much. They saw how Iran's influence has grown in Shiite-majority Iraq, along their northern border, and they were not prepared to let that happen again.

As for the U.S., the Saudis saw calls for reform as another in a string of disappointments and outright betrayals. Back in 2002, the U.S. had declined to get behind an offer from King Abdullah (then Crown Prince) to rally widespread Arab recognition for Israel in exchange for Israel's acceptance of borders that existed before the 1967 Six Day War—a potentially historic deal, as far as the Saudis were concerned. And earlier this year, President Obama declined a personal appeal from the king to withhold the U.S. veto at the United Nations from a resolution condemning continued Israeli settlement building in Jerusalem and the West Bank.

The Saudis believe that solving the issue of Palestinian statehood will deny Iran a key pillar in its regional expansionist strategy—and thus bring a win for the forces of Sunni moderation that Riyadh wants to lead. 

Iran, too, was starting to see a compelling case for action as one Western-backed regime after another appeared to be on the ropes. It ramped up its rhetoric and began using state media and the regional Arab-language satellite channels it supports to depict the pro-democracy uprisings as latter-day manifestations of its own revolution in 1979. Today the events in the North of Africa, Egypt, Tunisia and certain other countries have another sense for the Iranian nation.… This is the same as 'Islamic Awakening,' which is the result of the victory of the big revolution of the Iranian nation, said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Iran also broadcast speeches by Hezbollah's leader into Bahrain, cheering the protesters on. Bahraini officials say that Iran went further, providing money and even some weapons to some of the more extreme opposition members. Protest leaders vehemently deny any operational or political links to Iran, and foreign diplomats in Bahrain say that they have seen little evidence of it.

March 14 was the critical turning point. At the invitation of Bahrain, Saudi armed vehicles and tanks poured across the causeway that separates the two countries. They came representing a special contingent under the aegis of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a league of Sunni-led Gulf states, but the Saudis were the major driver. The Saudis publicly announced that 1,000 troops had entered Bahrain, but privately they concede that the actual number is considerably higher.

If both Iran and Saudi Arabia see themselves responding to external threats and opportunities, some analysts, diplomats and democracy advocates see a more complicated picture. They say that the ramping up of regional tensions has another source: fear of democracy itself.

Long before protests ousted rulers in the Arab world, Iran battled massive street protests of its own for more than two years. It managed to control them, and their calls for more representative government or outright regime change, with massive, often deadly, force. Yet even as the government spun the Arab protests as Iranian inspired, Iran's Green Revolution opposition movement managed to use them to boost their own fortunes, staging several of their best-attended rallies in more than a year.

Saudi Arabia has kept a wary eye on its own population of Shiites, who live in the oil-rich Eastern Province directly across the water from Bahrain. Despite a small but energetic activist community, Saudi Arabia has largely avoided protests during the Arab Spring, something that the leadership credits to the popularity and conciliatory efforts of King Abdullah. But there were a smattering of small protests and a few clashes with security services in the Eastern Province. 

The regional troubles have come at a tricky moment domestically for Saudi Arabia. King Abdullah, thought to be 86 years old, was hospitalized in New York, receiving treatment for a back injury, when the Arab protests began. The Crown Prince, Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, is only slightly younger and is already thought to be too infirm to become king. Third in line, Prince Nayaf bin Abdul Aziz, is around 76 years old. 

Viewing any move toward more democracy at home—at least on anyone's terms but their own—as a threat to their regimes, the regional superpowers have changed the discussion, observers say. The same goes, they say, for the Bahraini government. The problem is a political one, but sectarianism is a winning card for them, says Jasim Husain, a senior member of the Wefaq Shiite opposition party in Bahrain.

Since March 14, the regional cold war has escalated. Kuwait expelled several Iranian diplomats after it discovered and dismantled, it says, an Iranian spy cell that was casing critical infrastructure and U.S. military installations. Iran and Saudi Arabia are, uncharacteristically and to some observers alarmingly, tossing direct threats at each other across the Gulf. The Saudis, who recently negotiated a $60 billion arms deal with the U.S. (the largest in American history), say that later this year they will increase the size of their armed forces and National Guard. 

And recently the U.S. has joined in warning Iran after a trip to the region by Defense Secretary Gates to patch up strained relations with Arab monarchies, especially Saudi Arabia. Minutes after meeting with King Abdullah, Mr. Gates told reporters that he had seen evidence of Iranian interference in Bahrain. That was followed by reports from U.S. officials that Iranian leaders were exploring ways to support Bahraini and Yemeni opposition parties, based on communications intercepted by U.S. spy agencies. 

Saudi officials say that despite the current friction in the U.S.-Saudi relationship, they won't break out of the traditional security arrangement with Washington, which is based on the understanding that the kingdom works to stabilize global oil prices while the White House protects the ruling family's dynasty. Washington has pulled back from blanket support for democracy efforts in the region. That has bruised America's credibility on democracy and reform, but it has helped to shore up the relationship with Riyadh.

A look at the Sunni-Shiite divide in the Middle East and some of the key ﬂashpoints in the cold war between Saudi Arabia and Iran

The deployment into Bahrain was also the beginning of what Saudi officials describe as their efforts to directly parry Iran. While Saudi troops guard critical oil and security facilities in their neighbor's land, the Bahraini government has launched a sweeping and often brutal crackdown on demonstrators. 

It forced out the editor of the country's only independent newspaper. More than 400 demonstrators have been arrested without charges, many in violent night raids on Shiite villages. Four have died in custody, according to human-rights groups. Three members of the national soccer team, all Shiites, have also been arrested. As many as 1,000 demonstrators who missed work during the protests have been fired from state companies.

In Shiite villages such as Saar, where a 14-year-old boy was killed by police and a 56-year-old man disappeared overnight and showed up dead the next morning, protests have continued sporadically. But in the financial district and areas where Sunni Muslims predominate, the demonstrations have ended. 

In Yemen, the Saudis, also working under a Gulf Cooperation Council umbrella, have taken control of the political negotiations to transfer power out of the hands of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, according to two Saudi officials. 

We stayed out of the process for a while, but now we have to intervene, said one official. It's that, or watch our southern flank disintegrate into chaos.

The storm in Syria

Amir Taheri



April 16, 2011 -- Yesterday was supposed to be the first day of what Syrian despot Ba shar al-Assad had dubbed social calm; he hoped his mixture of promises and repressive measures would silence the pro-democracy uprising that has shaken the Ba'athist regime. Instead, the opposition mounted a Friday of Resolution, with fresh nationwide marches against tyranny. 

In addition to other empty moves, Assad had ordered the release of protesters arrested in the past four weeks provided they had not done anything that might undermine the interests of the state and the nation's security. Those qualifiers meant that by yesterday evening only nine people had been set free, out of an estimated 1,200 arrested in 18 cities -- and scores more were arrested yesterday. 

To be sure, the opposition didn't succeed in organizing a major march in the capital. But a crowd of no more than 600 marched from Damascus to the nearby town of Douma, where security forces have killed at least 30 demonstrators in the past two weeks. 

Yesterday was a success for the opposition. It managed to defy the massive security buildup to hold demonstrations in at least 20 cities, underlining its nationwide appeal. It also managed to show its presence in Aleppo, the country's second most populous city, which had remained relatively quiet until now. 

Also significant were the first demonstrations in the Druze areas, which had never before shown any sign of revolt against the Assad dynasty. Yesterday, Syria's biggest Druze city, Suwaidah, became an Assad-free zone as portraits of the despot and his father were burned in public. 

With the Druze joining the uprising, all of Syria's dozen or so ethnic and religious communities are now marching under the banner of revolt against the Assad dynasty. 

More important, perhaps, the day brought the first signs that at least parts of the security forces may be reluctant to shoot demonstrators in the street. According to my sources, security men have shot at least three soldiers on the spot for disobedience. 

These were cold-blooded executions in the street, one source tells me. The soldiers had refused to fire on marchers. They were killed by men from the Alawite minority to which Assad belongs. 

Two of the three soldiers shot have been identified as Muhammad Awadh Qanbar and Murad Hajoo, who died in Maddiyah. A third soldier was shot in the port city of Banias. 

In Tartus, Der'aah and the Kurdish city of Qamishli, Alawite elite units have replaced the regular army with orders to crush the demonstrations. 

Some special Alawite units, known as al-Ashbah or ghosts, appear in civilian clothes to kill demonstrators at random. The tactic is meant to terrorize the opposition, forcing it to stop its almost daily protests. 

These terror tactics are starting to radicalize the opposition, but some groups still hope to reach a peaceful way out of the crisis. Several human-rights groups have joined in the Damascus Declaration, calling for a negotiated departure of Bashar al-Assad and his entourage with the Syrian army acting as an interim government. 

Other groups, however, insist that the opposition is willing and able to set up a transitional authority and hold free elections, with the army ensuring the country's security. 

The Assad clan is trying to convince the outside world, including the United States and the European Union, that the regime's fall could lead to chaos and sectarian wars. It claims the opposition is either too divided to form a government, or might fall under the domination of the Muslim Brotherhood. 

Pro-democracy activists reject those claims. They tell me that they've been trying to establish formal contacts with both the US and EU to help the major democracies acquire a more balanced view of the situation. 

Assad's voice is not the only one that comes out of Syria, says Wassim Turayf, a spokesman for the protesters. The outside world should listen to other voices.

Political Order in Egypt 

Francis Fukuyama 



May - June 2011 -- While academic political science has not had much to tell policymakers of late, there is one book that stands out as being singularly relevant to the events currently unfolding in Tunisia, Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries: Samuel Huntington’s Political Order in Changing Societies, first published over forty years ago.1 Huntington was one of the last social scientists to try to understand the linkages between political, economic and social change in a comprehensive way, and the weakness of subsequent efforts to maintain this kind of large perspective is one reason we have such difficulties, intellectually and in policy terms, in keeping up with our contemporary world. 

Huntington, observing the high levels of political instability plaguing countries in the developing world during the 1950s and 1960s, noted that increasing levels of economic and social development often led to coups, revolutions and military takeovers rather than a smooth transition to modern liberal democracy. The reason, he pointed out, was the gap that appeared between the hopes and expectations of newly mobilized, educated and economically empowered people on the one hand, and the existing political system, which did not offer them an institutionalized mechanism for political participation, on the other. He might have added that such poorly institutionalized regimes are also often subject to crony capitalism, which fails to provide jobs and incomes to the newly educated middle class. Attacks against the existing political order, he noted, are seldom driven by the poorest of the poor; they instead tend to be led by rising middle classes who are frustrated by the lack of political and economic opportunity—a phenomenon noted by Alexis de Tocqueville in his masterful analysis of the origins of the French Revolution and raised again in the early 1960s by James Davies’s well known “J-curve” theory of revolution.2 

Something like this Huntingtonian process has unfolded in recent months in both Tunisia and Egypt. In both cases, anti-government protests were led not by the urban poor or by an Islamist underground, but by relatively well-educated middle-class young people used to communicating with each other via Facebook and Twitter. It is no accident that Wael Ghonim, Google’s regional head of marketing, emerged as a symbol and leader of the new Egypt. The protesters’ grievances centered around the fact that the authoritarian regimes of Ben Ali and Mubarak offered them no meaningful pathway to political participation, as well as failing to provide jobs befitting their social status. The protests were then joined by other groups in both societies—trade unionists, Islamists, peasants and virtually everyone else unhappy with the old regimes—but the driving force remained the more modern segments of Tunisian and Egyptian society. 

Societies lacking institutions that could accommodate new social actors produced a condition Huntington labeled praetorianism, in which political participation took the form of strikes, demonstrations, protests and violence. The military often seized power in such circumstances because it was the only organized actor in society capable of running a government. The Egyptian Republic’s first autocrat, Gamal Abdel Nasser, came to power in precisely this manner back in July 1952, when his Free Officers movement represented the rising Egyptian middle class. The tragedy of modern Egypt is that there has been scarcely any meaningful political development in the more than half-century since then—meaning, in Huntington’s terms, the rise of modern institutions that could peacefully channel citizen participation. 

Socioeconomic development, meanwhile, has proceeded apace: Between 1990–2010 Tunisia’s Human Development Index (a composite measure of health, education and income compiled by the UN) rose 30 percent, while Egypt’s rose 28 percent. Both countries produced tens of thousands of college graduates with no discernable future and a lopsided income distribution in which a disproportionate share of the gains from growth went to a small group of politically connected insiders. Huntington’s analysis of Egypt in the 1950s and 1960s thus remains eerily relevant today. 

In Political Order Huntington was also making a broader point about the process of development itself. The significance of his book needs to be seen against the backdrop of post-World War II modernization theory, which in turn drew on classic 19th-century European social theory articulated by academics like Edward Shils, Talcott Parsons and Walt W. Rostow. American modernization theory argued that development was a single, seamless process. Economic development, changing social relationships like the breakdown of extended kinship groups and the growth of individualism, higher and more inclusive levels of education, normative shifts toward values like “achievement” and rationality, secularization and the growth of democratic political institutions, were all seen as an interdependent whole. 

By pointing out that the good things of modernity did not necessarily go together, Huntington played a key role in killing off modernization theory. Political development was a separate process from socioeconomic development, he argued, and needed to be understood in its own terms. The conclusion that flowed from this point of view seemed at the time counterintuitive to the point of stunning: Without political development, the other aspects of modernization could lead to bad results—to tyranny, civil war and mass violence. 

There were other reasons why Western modernization theory fell into disrepute by the 1970s: It came to be regarded as too Eurocentric—indeed, as too Americentric insofar as it seemed to posit American society as the pinnacle of modernization. It failed to recognize the possibility that countries like Japan and China might take roads to modernity that would look very different from the ones pioneered by Britain and the United States. But even if one agreed that the end point of development should be some form of industrialized liberal democracy, Huntington made it clear that arriving at the desired destination was far more elusive and complicated than modernization theorists believed. 

The central piece of policy advice that emerged out of Huntington’s work was the concept of the “authoritarian transition.” If political systems opened up to democratic contestation too early, before the development of political parties, labor unions, professional associations and other organizations that could structure participation, the result could be chaotic. Authoritarian regimes that could maintain order and promote economic growth, Huntington argued, might oversee a more gradual institutionalization of society, and make a transition to democracy only when broad participation could be peacefully accommodated. This form of sequencing, in which economic development was promoted before a democratic opening, was the path followed by Asian countries like South Korea and Taiwan, which made democratic transitions in the late 1980s only after they had succeeded in turning themselves into industrialized powerhouses. It was also the development strategy recommended by Huntington’s former student Fareed Zakaria, as well as by the leaders of many authoritarian governments, who liked the idea of economic growth better than the idea of democratic participation.3 We will return to the question of how well that strategy worked in the Middle East later. 

Development in Silos 

As interesting and important as Huntington’s work was, it lay outside of mainstream thinking about development, which from the start was a highly Balkanized academic field that was dominated by economists. Few scholars have sought to understand development as an inter-connected process with political, economic and social parts. Development economists looked primarily at economic factors like capital, labor and technology as sources of economic growth, and thought neither about the consequences of growth for politics nor the relationship of political institutions to growth. The Harrod-Domar growth model that was dominant in the 1950s suggested that less-developed countries were poor primarily because they lacked capital, which then led development agencies like the World Bank to try to kick start growth with generous infusions of capital for physical infrastructure. It was only when steel plants and shoe factories in sub-Saharan Africa went idle due to corruption or lack of organizational capacity that they were forced to go back to the drawing board. 

The political scientists, for their part, scaled back their ambitions from large Huntingtonian-style theory and focused primarily on political phenomena. Beginning in the 1980s, there was increasing interest in the problem of transitions into and out of democracy; with democratic transitions in Spain, Portugal and nearly all of Latin America, this became a particularly pressing issue. There was some revival of interest in the democracy-development linkage, but it never led to a clear consensus on the causal links connecting the two phenomena. 

The academic interest in transitions corresponded to the burgeoning of democracy promotion as a distinct field of international practice, both on the part of the United States and of other democracies around the world. The idea was planted during the 1970s, when the institutes linked with the German political parties played a key role in beating back an attempted Communist takeover in Portugal and facilitating that country’s transition to democracy. The 1980s saw the establishment of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a taxpayer-funded but quasi-independent organization devoted to support of pro-democracy groups around the world. One of the NED’s early successes was its funding of the Solidarity trade union in Poland before the collapse of communism. The 1990s saw the growth of a host of international organizations capable of monitoring elections and the funding of the Democracy and Governance branch of the U.S. Agency for International Development to the tune of almost $1.5 billion annually. 

By the late 1990s, there was some degree of convergence in the agendas of economists and political scientists. By that point Douglass North and the school of “New Institutional Economics” he founded made economists aware of the importance of political institutions—particularly property rights—for economic growth. Economists increasingly sought to fold political variables like legal systems and checks on executive power into their models. Political science had itself been colonized at this point by economic methodology, and it was natural for such rational-choice political scientists to start looking at the economic impact of political institutions. 

The return to a more interdisciplinary approach to development was marked as well by the tenure of James Wolfenson as President of the World Bank from 1995 to 2005.4 Wolfenson early on gave a speech on the “cancer of corruption” and signaled to the institution that, henceforth, political issues like corruption and good governance would be taken seriously. The publication of the 1997 World Development Report, The State in a Changing World, marked an intellectual break with the Washington Consensus focus on economic policy and state downsizing, and the Bank created a new branch devoted to reform of developing country public sectors. These changes constituted an open admission that politics was a critical component of development, and that the state was not simply an obstacle to growth but often a necessary underpinning for it. Increasingly, donor agencies have seen the promotion of democratic accountability as one tool in the fight against corruption. 

This modest degree of convergence should not, however, obscure the continuing degree of compartmentalization that exists in the field of development. While paying lip service to the importance of institutions, most economists and field practitioners still see politics as at best an obstacle to the real work of development, which is improvement in incomes, health, education and the like, and not as an independent objective of development strategy. (Amartya Sen is an important exception to this generalization.) The democracy promotion agencies, for their part, spend relatively little time worrying about economic growth, social policy or public health, which in their view are goods often used by authoritarian regimes to buy off populations and prevent democratization. 

The intellectual confusion surrounding development has led to severely Balkanized policies both in the United States and in the international community that often work at cross purposes from one another. For example, the authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regimes of Meles Zenawi in Ethiopia, Paul Kagame in Rwanda and Yoweri Museveni in Uganda have been aid darlings over the past decade because of their track records in promoting economic, health and social goals. At the same time, democracy promotion groups have been highly critical of them and have supported opposition groups and civil society organizations seeking accountability and limits on executive power. To be sure, aid agencies don’t object to greater government accountability on the part of these regimes, while the democracy promotion community wouldn’t stand in the way of progress on HIV/AIDS or malaria. Yet no one takes a larger view and asks, for example, whether existing aid programs are helping to keep the regime in power or, conversely, are destabilizing it. 

Egypt itself presents a good case of this particular form of policy incoherence. Despite the fact that Egypt ranks as one of the top American aid recipients, it is hard to say that Washington was pursuing development goals of any sort there. The United States was primarily interested in stability. Despite brave speeches on democracy by both Condeleezza Rice and Barack Obama in Cairo, the United States actually pulled its punches in pushing serious democratic reform on Egypt, particularly after the Hamas electoral victory in Gaza in 2006. Nonetheless, U.S. economic aid programs were still pushing education and economic policy reform programs in the country. Had American aid administrators taken the Huntingtonian view that their assistance was covertly designed to promote an expectations gap and delegitimate Hosni Mubarak, this might have been a clever strategy. But no such cleverness existed. Instead, it was simply an example of compartmentalized aid programs doing their thing in ignorance of the interdependent effects of politics and economics. 

What Is to Be Done? 

Ideas precede action. Before we can hope to generate a coherent set of policies for Egypt, or anywhere else for that matter, we need a better understanding of development—that is, how changes in economy, politics and society over time constitute a set of discrete yet interlinked processes. Whatever the shortcomings of classic modernization theory, it at least began from the insight that the phenomenon under study required development of a master social science that transcended existing disciplinary boundaries. This objective is as far away as ever in academia, where the traditional disciplines keep a chokehold on how younger academics think and do research. Today, the single most popular form of development dissertation in both economics and political science is a randomized micro-experiment in which the graduate student goes out into the field and studies, at a local level, the impact of some intervention like the introduction of co-payments for malaria mosquito netting or changes in electoral rules on ethnic voting. These studies can be technically well designed, and they certainly have their place in evaluating projects at a micro level. But they do not aggregate upwards into anything that can tell us when a regime crosses the line into illegitimacy, or how economic growth is changing the class structure of a society. We are not, in other words, producing new Samuel Huntingtons, with the latter’s simultaneous breadth and depth of knowledge. 

On a policy level, we need far more mutual understanding between those who promote socioeconomic development and those who work on democracy promotion and governance. Traditional development agencies like USAID already think politically to the extent that their aid projects are designed to support U.S. foreign policy. But they, like their counterparts in multilateral organizations like the World Bank, are not trained to do political economy analysis; they do not seek an understanding of the political context within which aid is used and abused, and what is not sought is very rarely found. We call for the liberalization of ports in Haiti, for example, without trying to understand which particular politicians are benefiting from existing arrangements that keep them closed. For their part, democracy promoters focus on democratic transitions, providing help to opposition parties and civil society organizations in authoritarian countries. But once a transition occurs, as it did after the Orange and Rose revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia, they have relatively little to offer new democratic governments in terms of policy agendas, anti-corruption strategies or help in improving the delivery of services that citizens want. 

Beyond these relatively minor adjustments, a more robust theory of social change might tell us that, in certain circumstances, the best way to destabilize an authoritarian society would be not the funding of civil society groups seeking short-term regime change, but rather the promotion of rapid economic growth and the expansion of educational access.5 Conversely, there are many societies we know will simply waste development assistance dollars because they are ruled by unaccountable authoritarian regimes. In such circumstances, it might be a more efficient use of aid resources to cut development aid entirely and to work only for political change. This is, in effect, what has happened to Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe, but the country had to sink very far before anyone considered pulling the aid plug. 

Huntington got a number of things wrong. The authoritarian transition was not a universally applicable formula for development. It worked reasonably well in East Asia, where there were a number of figures like Lee Kwan Yew, Park Chung-hee or the Chinese Communist Party leadership, who used their autocratic powers to promote rapid development and social change. Arab authoritarians were cut from a different cloth, content to preside over economically stagnant societies. The result was not a coherent development strategy but a wasted generation. 

The aspiration of social science to replicate the predictability and formality of certain natural sciences is, in the end, a hopeless endeavor. Human societies, as Friedrich Hayek, Karl Popper and others understood, are far too complex to model at an aggregate level. Contemporary macroeconomics, despite dealing with social phenomena that are inherently quantified, is today in crisis due to its utter failure to anticipate the recent financial crisis. 

The part of social change that is the hardest to understand in a positivistic way is the moral dimension—that is, the ideas that people carry around in their heads regarding legitimacy, justice, dignity and community. The current Arab uprising was triggered by the self-immolation of an overeducated 26-year-old Tunisian vegetable seller whose cart was repeatedly confiscated by the authorities. After Mohamed Bouazizi was slapped by a policewoman when he tried to complain, he reached the end of his tether. Bouazizi’s public suicide turned into a social movement because contemporary communications technologies facilitated the growth of a new social space where middle-class people could recognize and organize around their common interests. We will probably never understand, even in retrospect, why the dry tinder of outraged dignity suddenly ignited in this fashion in December 2010 as opposed to 2009, or ten years before that, and why the conflagration spread to some Arab countries but not to others. But we can certainly do a better job in putting together the few pieces we do understand, in a way that would be useful to policymakers coping with the reality of social change.

The Budget Debate, Revealed

Richard W. Stevenson



April 16, 2011 — The air in the capital these days is thick with references to trillion-dollar deficits, debt-to-G.D.P. ratios and mandatory spending. But the budget debate that became fully engaged last week is about far more than accounting and arcane policy disputes. What is under way now is the most fundamental reassessment of the size and role of government — of the balance between personal responsibility and private markets on the one hand and public responsibility and social welfare on the other — at least since Ronald Reagan and perhaps since F.D.R. 

The battle ahead “is the big one, and goes to the very major questions about the role of government,” said G. William Hoagland, a former Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee. “This is going to be a very fundamental clash of ideologies.” 

The Democratic and Republican Parties have their own internal tensions to address as the debate goes forward in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail. But in its early stages at least, it is liberals who are on the defensive. 

The aging of the baby boom generation and the costs of maintaining Medicare and Social Security have put the two pillars of the social welfare system on the table for re-examination. The growing weight of the national debt has given urgency to the question of whether the government has become too big and expensive. 

The tepid nature of the current economic recovery, following big stimulus packages, has provided an opening to challenge the effectiveness of Keynesianism as the default policy option for government. And the revived energy of grass-roots conservatives has given electoral clout to the movement’s intellectual and constitutional arguments. 

Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative research organization, said, “The optimistic view is that we have a confluence of the business cycle, of the demography and of the politics that makes it not just possible to achieve real change, but impossible that we not deal with these things if we want this country to continue on the path envisioned by the founders.” So just two and a half years after a presidential election that was in part a repudiation of conservative governance, and with the nation still smarting from the aftereffects of a financial crisis that grew out of failures of markets and regulation, President Obama finds himself in a somewhat surprising position: forced to articulate and sell a vision of how liberalism and the institutions it built in the 20th century can be updated for the constraints of the 21st.  

The speech he delivered Wednesday at George Washington University in Washington was his most ambitious effort so far to do so. In it, he harnessed the language of both left and right to argue against the extremes on both sides while suggesting that many of their core principles were not mutually exclusive — in other words, that Great Society values can endure in a Tea Party moment. 

He defined “patriotism” as a shared sense of responsibility for the vulnerable and less fortunate. Basic standards of security for the elderly and poor and government investment in a more prosperous future, he said, can not only coexist with a tradition of “rugged individualists with a healthy skepticism of too much government,” but are also a vital part of what makes America exceptional. 

“We are a better country because of these commitments,” he said. “I’ll go further — we would not be a great country without those commitments.” 

Republicans in Congress, he suggested, would shred that tradition under cover of a debate that is only nominally about the budget. “The fact is,” he said, “their vision is less about reducing the deficit than it is about changing the basic social compact in America.” 

Conservatives would and did object to his implication of heartlessness, but not necessarily to his assessment of their ambition. 

The Republican plan put forward by Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and adopted by the House on Friday as its policy blueprint for the next decade contains a substantial dose of deficit reduction but is really a manifesto for limited government. 

It would take big steps toward privatizing Medicare, slash upper-income tax rates, repeal last year’s health care law, bite deeply into nearly all federal programs and try to cap the size of government relative to the economy. But it also imposes a self-consciously moral judgment on the government’s role, suggesting that the same kind of demand for added personal responsibility that was embedded in the 1996 overhaul of welfare should now be applied more broadly, to food stamps, housing aid and health care for the elderly and the poor. 

“The safety net should never become a hammock, lulling able-bodied citizens into lives of complacency and dependency,” Mr. Ryan’s budget proposal says. 

William A. Galston, who was a domestic policy aide to President Bill Clinton and is now a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Ryan deserved credit of a sort for addressing head-on the implications of the Republican Party’s increasingly rigid antitax posture, which since it took root in the late 1970s has put greater and greater pressure on budgets and the social programs they support. 

“It represents the first serious effort to begin to bring Republican social policy commitments in line with their fiscal and tax commitments,” Mr. Galston said. 

But he said Democrats, too, faced a credibility test. “They have held fast to the security programs in place since the 1930s, but without being able to successfully challenge the antitax orthodoxy,” he said. “The problem the Democrats have is that they can no longer say with a straight face that raising taxes on the wealthy is going to enable them to pay over the next generation for the programs they cherish. So what do you do?” 

That question is being asked quietly within both parties, each of which faces its own internal tensions about how to proceed. 

There are Republicans who fear that voting for the Ryan plan will put them out of step with their constituents. There are Democrats who think the tax-and-spend label is all too accurate. There are Republicans who might countenance voting for tax increases, and there are Democrats who are willing to meaningfully scale back the benefits promised by Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 

 In the Senate, a group of Democrats and Republicans operating independently of party leaders is trying to come up with a plan that neither party would like but both would accept as necessary. But they are debating basic values; it would no doubt be much easier if the argument was just about numbers.

yin and yang is among the oldest in Chinese philosophy. “When heaven and earth
were formed, they divided into yin and yang,” the Huainanzi, one of China’s greatest
political texts explains. “Yang is generated from yin and yin is generated from yang.”
Hangzhou became a capital of yin. It produced perhaps some of the greatest Chinese
philosophy and poetry and art. Greatness emerged from that stillness - and, even
today, to sit by West Lake and drink a cup of the Dragon Well tea produced on the
nearby hillsides is to have every one of your senses flooded by tranquility.

That yin-yang balance gives us, in a sense, a way to understand that split power ona
network by seeing it is not, really, split. Network power is energetic and wild at the
ends, with all the creative energy of a world filled with devices, empowered human
dreams, and the violent slips of old balances. Yang. But at the center it is dense, still,
even quiet with the silently cranking algorithms of massively concentrated power.
The computer science pioneer Claude Shannon saw information in 1949 as wild,
uncertain, and pulsing with the instability of an entropic system. Yang. The machine
architect Norbert Weiner, writing at nearly the same moment in 1948, saw the
digital age differently - as an expression of stability and structure. Yin.1° His vision
for a digital order, what he called “cybernetics,” emerged from the Greek concept of
kibernetes - the orderly steering of a ship through sometimes chaotic waters.

We now know: the humming webs around us are both. They are ordered and
structured. 1°? Good and evil. Power in this connected age is concentrated and
distributed. Each feeds the other. The crops need the thunderstorm; the
thunderstorm feeds from the heat radiated off the land. Or: The yang violence of the
Manchurian wars bred the conditions for the yin renaissance in Hangzhou. The
massive distribution of connected points creates revolutions, economic disruption,
crackling innovation. But it also creates a need for more centralization, more
agreement on protocols or platforms. This idea of opposites balancing into a whole
is not unique to Chinese civilization. You can find it too in ancient Greek or Roman
tradition. Heraclitis, for instance, insisting, “All things are one.” Or in the view that
there can be no love without hate, no stillness without chaos, no beauty without the
unbeautiful and fortunately - as we're about to see - no destruction without
creation.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025274.txt,"High yield corporate bonds

Preference: overweight

Spread USD HY (24 Oct): 540bps (last month: 573bps)
UBS View USD HY spread target (6-month): 475bps

¢ We reiterate our spread target of 475bps based on still robust corporate fundamentals, a favorable
technical backdrop and the commitment of major central banks to provide strong monetary support. In
particular, the Fed's buying of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) is likely to provide further support for the
credit universe.

¢ Thus, US high yield (HY) bonds continue to offer attractive value although spreads tightened
considerably in Q3. We think the recent rally has been justified in light of the favorable default outlook
and central bank action. The ongoing slow recovery of the US economy, healthy company balance sheets,
robust earnings, and strong investor appetite for yield assets continue to push spreads lower. US HY thus
remains our preferred asset class.

¢ Despite the recent uptick in defaults, in the absence of a renewed US recession, we expect the default
rate to remain stable at 3.5% until the end of the year. A heavy load of new issuance so far this year means
that HY companies will be faced with a lower risk of failed refinancing going forward (e.g. in case of an
unexpected economic slump).

4 Positive scenario USD HY spread target (6-month): 400bps

e Even in the positive economic scenario, spreads are unlikely to tighten to pre-crisis lows of below 300bps
due to lower liquidity and a generally higher risk premium after the financial crisis. Benchmark yields
would rise, limiting HY returns to around 7%. European HY outperforms the US.

& Negative scenario USD HY spread target (6-month): 1,000bps
e A global recession is the major risk for high yield bonds. Based on the robust state of the corporate
sector, we would not expect spreads to surpass usual recession levels around 1,000bps. Although short-
term spikes are possible due to liquidity suddenly drying up, we expect a quick normalization.

Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)

What we're watching Why it matters
Credit quality/

default cycle

US earnings were roughly flat in 2Q compared to 1Q. A modest pickup is expected in 2H.
Balance sheets are backed by high cash levels and low debt ratios. Against this backdrop
the default rate will likely remain below its long-term average.

New issuance For now, favorable conditions in the primary market have mainly been used for
refinancing. More aggressive issuance activities should be monitored.

Bank lending standards

2 UBS

Bank lending provides an important source of funding. US banks relaxed standards
further in early 3Q. Key dates: late October, US Fed Senior Loan Officer Survey

For further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Philipp Schdttler, philipp.schoettler@ubs.com

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e US high yield corporate bonds offer an
attractive return outlook and should be
overweighted.

We prefer US over European issuers given
the increasing proportion of peripheral
and financial issuers in the European HY
universe and the poorer economic outlook
in Europe.

Inflows into HY mutual funds have been
strong so far in 2012. New issuance was
strong in Q3.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e We expect US defaults to remain at below-
average levels for longer. Significant re-
leveraging is unlikely in the medium term.

e We believe US high yield corporate bonds
will provide good returns both relative to
other fixed income and for absolute
return-oriented investors.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021378.txt,"Genetic studies indicate that
heritability accounts for approximately
50% of loneliness while social
circumstances account for the other 50%
(7). Research also suggests that
loneliness is common - reported by as
many as 20 percent of the population at
any given time (8). In addition, some
evidence suggests that the prevalence of
loneliness may be increasing, at least in
the U.S. A recent national survey found
a threefold increase in the number of
Americans who indicated they had no
confidant or person with whom to
discuss important matters (9). Although
differences between this survey and its
1985 predecessor may be sufficient to
account for this increase, this suggestive
report raises the possibility that
contemporary societal factors may be
interfering with the natural tendency for
humans to form meaningful, long-term
social connections. One factor is social
mobility, which increased dramatically
during the 20 century. A second is the
aging of the U.S. population. In 1900,
4.1% of Americans were 65 years or
older. By 2006, that percentage had
increased to 12.4%, representing 37.3
million Americans (10). With less value
placed on older individuals in the U.S.,
we have witnessed an increase in
marginalization of this segment of
society. Third, as life expectancy
increases, more elders are living longer
as widows or widowers and are therefore
at increased risk for loneliness. Other
factors which may place Americans at
increased risk for loneliness include less
intergenerational living, delayed
marriage, increased dual- career
families, increased single-residence
households, and increased age-related
disabilities and health conditions. Given
the mental and health risks associated
with loneliness described in Hawkley’s

132

Page

chapter, interventions are needed to help
lonely individuals regain normal social
connections. As Bunyan’s account
suggests, breaking through the wall of
loneliness may require considerable
effort. When individual effort is not
sufficient, assistance from others may be
needed. Unfortunately, contemporary
interventions to reduce loneliness have
fared more poorly than has been
recognized.

Repairing Broken Connections

Almost a century ago, scholars
began to propose strategies for reducing
loneliness. Karen Rook (11), for
instance, amassed over 40 interventions
dating back to the 1930’s in her attempt
to identify effective loneliness reduction
strategies. Since Rook’s review, five
scientific publications have provided
qualitative reviews of strategies to
reduce loneliness, social isolation, or
both (12-16). The most recent
publication identified 30 interventions
published between 1970 and 2002 (16),
and evaluated the effectiveness of those
intervention studies that were not flawed
by poor design. Among the thirteen trials
deemed to be of high quality, six were
considered effective, one was considered
partially effective, five were considered
ineffective, and one was inconclusive.
The authors’ conclusions were similar to
those of prior reviewers who found that
interventions which emphasized social
skills training and/or group activities
were the most successful.

However, qualitative reviews are
subject to invisible biases that can color
our judgments of the scientific evidence
we see. Thomas Kuhn, a 20 century
physicist and epistemologist, noted that
scientists too easily accept results which
conform to previous intuitions and too
readily reject results which do not (17).

FRIEZE 2010

luckyzhouxi #£7¢ + 2010-11-06 21:29:34

This year’s annual London Frieze 2010 was the strongest Frieze fair since the global economic collapse that began
in autumn 2008. Frieze 2010 saw noticeable increases in artwork sales activity; better certainly than the last two
Frieze fairs. Good or bad, these temporary exhibits in ritzy mansions in central London’s most expensive
neighborhoods, are a far cry from the gritty underground art happenings of earlier alternative venues.
Temporarily setting up in fashionablecentral London locales walking distance to Frieze’s fair grounds inside
Regent Park is admittedly an ultra commercial way to sell art.

After all, one might argue, the aim of selling art is the same whether in a humble fair booth, or an exaggerated
mansion. This author admits to attending two suchevents, one in a historic townhouse former embassy of an
African nation,[1] the other in a newly built super-luxury home with not only artwork for purchase but also the
venue — a newly built marble fixtured mansion in Regent’s Park itself for sale, with a price tag of50 million
dollars.[2] The former showed newly commissioned works made especially for the exhibition by a variety of
contemporary artists including Jake and Dinos Chapman, Tim Noble and Sue Webster and Wim Delvoye.

is

The latter showed everyone from Cezanne to Rodin to Zeng Fanzhi and Yin Zhaoyang, and felt more like a
collective effort of secondary market sale works consigned from various dealers and owners. The artworks one
assumes are used to make the house-for-sale more beautiful and presumably also more sale-able. Interesting
Russian contemporary works were also included, fueling rumors of Russian financial backing for the Regent’s Park
situated mansion-for sale-with-or-without- artworks.

true against the JPY given the Bank of Japan is pegging 10y JGB yields at zero. We are
cognizant of the possibility that the willingness of Japanese investors — who have
already bought record amount of US bonds this year — to buy more is likely to be
constrained by their recent losses (Chart 7). However, with long-dated USD/JPY forward
outrights near their lowest levels in more than a year, further purchases are more likely
to be currency unhedged (Chart 8). This is why we would recommend buying USD/JPY

even after the big rally of the past week.

More generally, the USD is likely to benefit from repatriation of overseas US corporate
earnings, which is highly likely, in our view, given that it is the lowest hanging fruit in

Washington for the new administration.

4. MXN is oversold but BRL faces more headwinds

Until the US election, EM fixed income was the best performing asset class in 2016,
benefiting from the decline in rates in core markets as well as the rebound in global
growth. The combination of higher US rates and higher USD over the past week has
nearly wiped out its YTD gains. However, long positions remain crowded (Chart 9) and
liquidity conditions are poor. For these reasons, we think downside risk remains and
would recommend selling a basket of Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian long bonds.

Some EM markets have already seen brutal capitulation. In particular, MXN has priced in
alot of bad news, even though it is not clear that the net impact of Trump policy is
negative for Mexico. In contrast, the BRL remains one of the most crowded EM

Slowing economy could increase pressure 
on Big Tech 
Sara Fischer, David McCabe, Courtenay Brown5 hours ago 
A potential recession, combined with increasing regulatory threats for some of the biggest 
tech companies, foreshadows a difficult 2019 for Silicon Valley. 
Why it matters: The biggest tech companies have already raked in billions of dollars in 
profits and benefited from major tax cuts that aren't going to be repeated, so next year isn't 
likely to be better for them financially. They've also been dogged by scandals that have left 
many questioning their positive role in society, and if on top of that the economy starts to 
slip, 2019 could be worse. 
People look for scapegoats in a bad economy. And with big tech already on its heels, a 
downturn probably would feed arguments that the largest internet companies are too big 
and need to be reined in. 
— Paul Gallant, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group 
Big Tech is closing out a contentious year in Washington, and potential regulation will 
continue to haunt it well into 2019. 
• Google CEO Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before Congress, and will likely be 
asked about whether the company is being transparent about its data privacy practices and 
any potential bias. By the year's end, the CEOs of Twitter, Google and Facebook will have 
been called to testified in front of Congress for the first time ever during 2018. 
• Lawmakers in the United States are pushing for a federal privacy law with an urgency 
likely to be exacerbated by more breaches like the one Marriott disclosed last Friday. 
• The Federal Trade Commission still has an open investigation into whether 
Facebook's conduct violated a previous settlement with the agency. Margrethe Vestager, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033395 
Europe's aggressive commissioner overseeing competition, is still investigating aspects of 
Google's business and whether Amazon plays fair in the market for generic products. 
• President Trump has said his administration is seriously looking into monopolistic 
behavior of Facebook, Google and Amazon. 
Some analysts predict an economic slowdown___even if it doesn't lead to a recession like 
the one in 2008___will be enough to change the global attitude around big American 
companies. 
So the really shocking thing this year is that the only major economy in the world where 
growth has actually accelerated this year is America. And this is because of the tax cuts, the 
deregulation, the other stimulus which has been put into work. And that has also helped the 
earnings of companies. My point is, from next year onwards, those effects begin to fade. 
— Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley on Fareed Zakaria GPS  
on Sunday 
The FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) that pushed the 
stock market to record highs have not been immune from this year's market rout. 
• The mood has changed. Investors are asking a lot more questions right now, says 
Larry Glazer, a Managing Partner at Mayflower Advisors, which manages $3 billion. 
Momentum has faded on these names. 
• Adding to potential concern: possible regulatory action could translate into higher 
costs, particularly for Google or Facebook. 
• Facebook has been under such a dark cloud for so long that now everybody is 
expecting the worst, Paul Meeks, a technology portfolio manager at Wireless Fund, told 
Amos. 
The other side: I don't see a looming recession. And even if there was, people aren't going 
to target these companies if there is a recession, says Nicholas Economides, Professor of 
Economics at NYU Stem School of Business. 
• Economides argues that, even if there was a mild reduction in GDP growth, it 
wouldn't significantly impact the high tech sector. 
• For companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, their main revenue streams are 
from ads. They gain market share from brands converting traditional ad spend to digital ads. 
This conversion is not so dependent on the growth of GDP, because they are still in the 
process of converting ads of different formats to digital ads, and that's something that will 
continue, regardless of GDP growth. 
The bottom line: Tech companies that have long been the darlings of investor portfolios 
will likely find themselves in much weaker positions.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016123.txt,"National Transformation Plan: many promises, few details
The National Transformation Plan (NTP) released by the Saudi government is a further
step towards execution of Saudi Vision 2030 through a set of ambitious interim targets
to achieve by 2020 by 24 government bodies. The NTP is a comprehensive program
encompassing medium-term growth boosting initiatives and fiscal consolidation
measures. The sequencing and details of the fiscal measures are however still left
nebulous. Implementation of growth-boosting initiatives will require a challenging
crowding in of private sector investment, particularly from domestic sources.

The NTP is likely to introduce a number of one-off supply-side shocks to inflation
through its fiscal or labor measures, which could negatively impact Real Effective
Exchange Rate (REER) competitiveness. Discretionary consumption growth and real
incomes are likely to remain under pressure. We find the diversification measures
encouraging, although they appear too ambitious to be met within the time frame
envisaged in the NTP, in our view. The focus on diversification could introduce medium-
term incentives to adopt a more competitive exchange rate, while also detracting from
the binding fiscal constraint under which the government has to operate. Energy policy
is likely to be less aggressive and support oil prices. Fiscal targets are difficult to reach,
but medium-term oil prices of at least US$50-65/bbI could support NTP progress.

Saint Thomas is an island in the Caribbean Sea -
directly east of Puerto Rico. Together with St. John and
Water Island, St. Thomas forms a county and constituent
district of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), an
unincorporated territory of the United States. Located . :
on the island of Saint Thomas is the territorial capita = = ; - = er? 2 Soca
and port of Charlotte Amalie. As of the 2010 census, the :
population of Saint Thomas was 51,634 about 48.5% of
the US Virgin Islands total. The district has a land area of
31.24 square miles.

i

In 1917, St. Thomas was purchased (along with Saint
John and Saint Croix) by the United States for $25
million in gold, as part of a defensive strategy to
maintain control over the Caribbean and the Panama
Canal during the First World War. U.S. citizenship was
granted to the residents of St. Thomas in 1927 and the
U.S. Department of the Interior took over administrative
duties in 1931. American forces were based on the island
during the Second World War and the 1954, passage
of the U.S. Virgin Islands Organic Act officially granted
territorial status to the three islands - St. Thomas, St.
John, and Water Island.

St. Thomas

. Thomas has a lively tourist trade. It is the USVI’s most
osmopolitan island, yet it still retains the distinctive
tmosphere of a secluded Caribbean paradise. St.
omas is packed with many tourism activities including
hopping, sailing, snorkeling, sightseeing, diving and
ining. The Island is home to a world-renowned golf
ourse, picture-perfect beaches and a spectacular
nightlife. Other attractions are the Skyride (700 feet
above the city) and the famous 99 Steps of Charlotte
Amalie for an incomparable view of the Caribbean, as
well as the second-oldest synagogue in the Western
Hemisphere, the 1680-built Fort Christian.

aaYVYADMDAN

St. Thomas is developed with many hotels offering a
variety of lodging alternatives from grand resort estates
to small inns and villas. It is also a destination for many
Caribbean cruises due to the Island's breathtaking views,
secluded beaches and a deeply relaxing atmosphere.

practically include comprehensive coverage of the United States.” As a result, he wrote. “The
amount of US communications ingested by the NSA is still increasing.”

He further offered to substantiate her worst fears about the growth of NSA surveillance’ “TI
know the location of most domestic interception points, and that the largest telecommunication
companies in the US are betraying the trust of their customers, which I can prove.” He even
proffered, evidence implicating President Barak Obama in illegal surveillance. “There is a detailed
policy framework, a kind of martial law for cyber operations, created by the White House. It’s
called presidential policy 20,” he wrote her. It was an 18-page directive that Obama had signed
four months earlier in October 2012. Snowden was offering to reveal to her the up-to-date
evidence of a surveillance state in America presided over by the President himself. It was what
she had been searching for three years. How could she, as an activist film-maker, resist such a
sensational offer?

He further explained to her that he had placed great trust in his discretion. “No one, not even
my most trusted confidante, is aware of my intentions, and it would not be fair for them to fall
under suspicion for my actions,” he said.

Poitras must have found it flattering that a total stranger was willing to disclose to her in
emails what he would not tell even his “most trusted confidante” about his intentions to commit
an illicit breach of U.S. national security. It was an extraordinary risk he was taking. After all,
“Citizen 4” had no way of knowing who she else she told about him. She had long been
concerned, with good reason that the U.S. government was out to get her. An unknown person
offering to supply her with secret documents could be attempting to entrap her. So he could not
preclude she would not consult with others about the offer he was making her. Since her
current documentary project included interviews with Assange, Appelbaum and three ex-NSA
executives, intelligence services with sophisticated surveillance capabilities might also have
taken a professional interest in her communications, as Poitras herself had suspected. Even if
Snowden was somehow able to use his position as a system administrator at Dell to ascertain
that the NSA did not have Poitras under surveillance, he could not be sure that other agencies,
such as the Russian and Chinese intelligence services, were not be monitoring his
communications with Poitras. It was, however, a chance Snowden evidently was willing to take.

Snowden, in any case, did not intend to conceal his identity for more than a few months. He
told Poitras he had a specific purpose in allowing her to name him in her film. Indeed, he said it
was essential in his plan to prevent others, including presumably his “most trusted confidante,”
from being suspected by law enforcement of helping him in his enterprise. He prevailed on her
to accommodate his plan, saying: “You may be the only one who can prevent that, and that is by
immediately nailing me to the cross rather than trying to protect me as a source.” His choice of
the imagery of crucifixion suggested that, like Jesus Christ, he was willing to sacrifice himself for
the sake of others.

In keeping with their operational security regime, he said that he would first send her an
encrypted file of documents that she would not be able to read. Only after his conditions were

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011056.txt,"Marshall’s pupil Keynes was thoroughly a marginalist, as are economists in general
today and as am I. One of the features of his General Theory of 1936 was a kind of
double-entry accounting for national product. Product was output and equivalently
income. Output meant the sum of prices of final products produced within the year,
while income meant the shares of that sum paid to the workers and investors

producing it. His double-entry idea can be put as

output = investment + consumption = income = pay + profit. (6.19)

I showed why | disagree. But let us see how the total return truism might seem to

have led to that inference if we leave workers or human capital outside the economy.

To treat them as arriving exogenously from outside is essentially to treat the
national economy as if it were a single firm. Output inside is simply profit. Output

outside is work, meaning creation of value by the workers. This gives the truism
output = work + profit,

confirming that total output is the sum of factor outputs.

So far, so good. But now Mill and Keynes and most tradition slip by arguing that pay

equals and compensates all of work and nothing else. That’s why (6.18) equates

output to pay plus profit. Schultz and Ben-Porath and other students of human

capital correct this in part by recognizing some work as self-invested rather than

marketed for pay. My pay rule adds that pay recovers human depreciation as well as

realized work. (6.19) should have reasoned

output = income = work + profit

= pay + self-invested work - human depreciation + profit. (6.20)

Epilogue

Over the past six years, our
network of scholars has engaged in an

a The lead author is Ronald Thisted, Ph.D., a
Professor in the Departments of Health Studies,
Statistics, and Anesthesia & Critical Care at the
University of Chicago, where he currently chairs
the Department of Health Studies. Trained in
philosophy and mathematics at Pomona College
and in statistics at Stanford University, his
interests mclude the nature of argument and
evidence, particularly in the context of health,
disease, and medical treatment. He has
published articles on topics ranging from
treatment for back pain to computational
mathematics, and from social determinants of
health to the size of Shakespeare’s vocabulary.
He is a Fellow of the American Statistical
Association, and a Fellow of the American
Academy for the Advancement of Science.

The question of how we come to
know—or to claim that we know—things, is left
unexamined all too often. The similarities and
differences in modes of argument across
disciplines, and the variations in what counts for
evidence supporting or refuting a position within
and across disciplines can be illuminating.
Statistics, and statistical argument, provide a rich
framework for thinking about such issues as
measurement, learning, uncertainty, variation,
and experiment. Statistical principles provide a
framework for disciplined investigation, for
communication about the extent of and
limitations to the information at hand, and for
combining information from different sources.
Although there is enormous variability between
individuals, there are also commonalities to their
experience that transcend their differences. As a
species and as individuals, we rely on these
common threads, even when they are invisible to
us.

on-going conversation that we have
come to recognize as being centered on
unseen forces that shape, and are shaped
by, the social nature of human beings.
The essays that make up this volume
give a hint as to what our conversation
has been like, but the linear structure that
a book imposes cannot fully evoke the
give and take of vigorous debate, the
excitement of viewing an old problem
from a new perspective, or the
satisfaction that comes from sharing the
search for knowledge — even when we
did not agree on the interpretation of
what we discovered in our search.

We deliberately chose to describe
our membership as a network rather than
a committee, or seminar, or task force, or
club, or salon. A network is defined as
much by the connections between people
as it is by the individual people
themselves. Networks can be described
pictorially as nodes (points that represent
individuals), some of which are
connected by edges (lines that represent
links between two individuals). In our
network, we have focused on the value
of the edges, and have held the
conviction that much is to be gained by
exploring previously untested
connections. We started with a set of
nodes having only a handful of edges,
and we ended with many more edges
than nodes.

As aresult, our network — and
each individual in the network — has
been enriched as we have learned more
about, and more from, perspectives that
initially were unfamiliar to each of us,
the end result being that our whole is
decidedly greater than the sum of our
parts. This illustrates a recurrent theme
in the book, that of emergent
phenomena—characteristics that can be
ascribed to entities at a higher level of
organization that, without conscious

Stock view: Becoming the one-stop social shop

We expect Facebook to report upside to Street 1Q revenue (but less in absolute dollars
than in 4Q) driven by robust demand, Instagram momentum, and solid underlying user
growth and engagement. Early ad checks in the quarter indicate steady advertiser
trends, with some elements of seasonality off a stronger 4Q, and strength at Instagram.
We expect pricing tailwinds to begin to pick up as we approach ad inventory supply
moderation in 2H17, and a flurry of new product introductions could provide additional
sources of ad load inventory over time. Overall, we see 1Q as an in-line to slightly better
quarter, and are optimistic on the set-up for the remainder of the year for pricing,
expense management, user engagement, and new platforms/feature ramps. Facebook
will be hosting its F8 developer conference before earnings in San Jose on April 18-19.

Facebook had another busy quarter of new product launches with a notable trend of
Snapchat-like features (Stories, Direct ephemeral messaging) and Video. At this point,
we believe the Snap threat is less of a near-term concern. Recent key product/feature
releases include:

¢ Stories for all: On the tail of a successful Instagram Stories launch in 8/16,
Facebook rolled out WhatsApp Status (2/17), Messenger Day (3/17), and Facebook
Stories (3/17).

- Direct ephemeral messaging: After introducing ephemeral direct photo/video
sharing on Instagram in 11/16, Facebook announced a comparable feature with
integrated filters/masks/frames for the core Facebook app in 3/17.

¢ Video App for TV: Announced in February, new app for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV,
and Samsung Smart TV to enable FB video viewing on TV.

« New ad products: Instagram Stories ads (1/17) a positive tailwind to Instagram ad
load, while vertical video ads (Facebook 9/16, Instagram 11/16) and Collections
(3/17) are likely positive for pricing.

While, in many ways, Facebook is duplicating Snapchat’s innovation, we are encouraged
with the rate of new product introductions and view the Facebook Stories and Direct
ephemeral messaging (with filters/masks) as positives for user engagement and
potential barriers to competitive risk. While management’s focus in the near-term will
likely be on new feature adoption, we expect Stories ads within 1-2 quarters and the
company is already establishing partnerships for branded masks/filters (see More
Stories in the Snap competitive saga). Over time, we would not be surprised to see
filter/mask features and ads added to WhatsApp and, possibly, Messenger, which could
unlock new monetization potential.

On the expense front, we continue to view management’s 2017 expense growth
forecast (47-57%) as conservative. History would seem to suggest manage could trim
the top of the range on the 2Q earnings call, with more meaningful revisions in 2H17.
That said, we won’t be surprised if management maintains the outlook on the April call,
particularly given the velocity of new feature launches and potential investments in
video content.

Thus, when we teach planning, there is either a lot to undo, or we
must start from the beginning. We can try to explain why each and
every old plan is not really helpful in a new situation, or we can teach
a series of plans that are relevant. In other words, if you are trying to
teach people to write a business plan, you need to start with a lemon-
ade stand and work up. If you are trying to teach financial planning,
you need to start with a child’s allowance and work up. If you want to
teach battle planning, try a tug of war first. This is what should have
occurred in childhood. If it didn’t, it needs to be restarted that way for
adults. We need to use, again and again, plans in different situations
that are simple and begin to analyze why they fail. (And these plans
must fail, at least in simulation, or no real learning will occur.)

Planning is very difficult. It must start simple and be practiced
simply for a while or it never becomes second nature. Plans must fail,
at least in simulation, because analysis of what went wrong is a critical
part of planning. If you aren’t analyzing what went wrong, you aren’t
learning to plan. Your case base will not end up having been indexed
well enough to enable you to pick and choose appropriate plans in
the future.

HOW TO TEACH CAUSATION

At the root of diagnosis and planning is causation. Detecting cause
is an essential part of diagnosis, and anticipating cause is an impor-
tant aspect of planning. Causation must be understood in order to do
many things in this world. One needs to know what causes what. Sci-
ence courses in school attempt to teach causation by having students
memorize F = ma, or having them imitate chemistry experiments, or
having them dissect a frog. While there is nothing wrong with any
of that in principle, it really doesn’t teach causation in a way that is
particularly useful to a functioning adult.

While diagnosis and planning may not be recognized as critical
skills by schools, causation is, although not under that word. Cau-
sation is understood as being what science is all about, and when
schools endeavor to teach science, they are in fact trying to teach
causation. This is true for social science as well. History is about cau-
sation, as is psychology. The fact that these subjects are not talk-
ed about in this way indicates something important about them.

curfew on Kiryat Arba and, for the first time, were given the authority to use
administrative detention orders not just against Palestinians, but specific Jewish
settlers. We arrested about a half-dozen leaders of Kach, the far-right, anti-Arab
political movement founded by the American Rabbi Meir Kahane, of which
Baruch Goldstein had also been a member. Still, there were repeated clashes
anyway — and dozens of deaths as a result — before things finally began to
subside a week or so later.

The massacre had made me feel more strongly than ever that our
responsibility to protect the security of the settlers could not extend to allowing
them to defy the government or the law. The principle would be put to the test
within a few weeks. A settlement near Hebron, called Tel Rumeida, had been
set up without government approval in 1984. As part of the response to
Goldstein killings, Rabin was thinking of closing it down. That prompted a
number of right-wing rabbis to issue a formal religious ruling against any such
action. Rabin called me in to ask whether it would be operationally possible to
dismantle Tel Rumeida and remove the settlers. I said yes, by sending in a
Sayeret Matkal force after midnight, as long as news of the operation did not
leak ahead of time. “We'll take over the area, close it off and get control.”
Given the tensions in the wake of the massacre, I did add that I couldn’t promise
that our soldiers would hold fire. “There are people in there with weapons,” I
said. “If someone shoots at them, they will shoot back.”

“Should | do it?” he asked me. Maybe I should have given him an answer.
But I didn’t feel it was my place to add to the pressures around what was clearly
a finely balanced call, especially since my inclination would have been to tell
him to go ahead. I said it was something only he could decide. “What I can tell
you is that we can do it.” When I left, my sense was that he was sufficiently
angry over what had happened in Hebron that he felt it essential to draw a line —
the line of law — over what settlers were allowed to do. But the Passover holiday
was now a couple of days away. I think what happened is that he realized the
operation would not be possible until after the holiday period. By then, he was
concerned he would have lost the clear political logic for moving against Tel
Rumeida. The settlement has remained in place, a flashpoint in the conflict
between settlers and Palestinians in the area around Hebron.

The wider repercussions, and the controversy, from the massacre
reverberated widely. Rabin and his cabinet immediately decided to establish an
inquiry, under Supreme Court Chief Justice Meir Shamgar. It would look into

BREYER, J., dissenting

In light of this history, how likely is it that Congress,
seeking to “satisfy in full the requirements of ... interna-
tional organizations conducting activities in the United
States,” S. Rep. No. 861, at 2-8 (emphasis added), would
have understood the statute to take from many interna-
tional organizations with one hand the immunity it had
given them with the other? If Congress wished the Act to
carry out one of its core purposes—fulfilling the country’s
international commitments—Congress would not have
wanted the statute to change over time, taking on a mean-
ing that would fail to grant not only full, but even partial,
immunity to many of those organizations.

B

Congress also intended to facilitate international organ-
izations’ ability to pursue their missions in the United
States. To illustrate why that purpose is better served by
a static interpretation, consider in greater detail the work
of the organizations to which Congress wished to provide
broad immunity. Put the IMF to the side, for Congress
enacted a separate statute providing it with immunity
(absent. waiver) in all cases. See 22 U.S.C. §286h. But
UNRRA, the World Bank, the FAO, and the UN itself all
originally depended upon the Immunities Act for the
immunity they sought.

Consider, for example, the mission of UNRRA. The
United States and other nations created that organization
in 1948, as the end of World War IT seemed in sight. Its
objective was, in the words of President Roosevelt, to
“assure a fair distribution of available supplies among
those liberated in World War II, and “‘to ward off death by
starvation or exposure among these peoples.’” 1 G. Wood-
bridge, UNRRA: The History of the United Nations Relief
and Rehabilitation Administration 3 (1950). By the time
Congress passed the Immunities Act in 1945, UNRRA had
obtained and shipped billions of pounds of food, clothing,

Rabin had inherited a peace process, put in motion by the Bush
Administration after the Gulf War. But since both Prime Minister Shamir and
our Arab enemies had reasons of procedure, politics or principle to resist the
talks, merely getting them off the ground had required the same combination of
deftness and determination President Bush had brought to assembling his
wartime coalition and defeating Saddam. After a formal opening session in
Madrid, the “bilateral tracks” — between Israel and negotiators from Syria,
Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians — had quickly stalemated and stalled.

Yitzhak came to office saying he was not interested in a peace process,
which seemed to him a license for endless talk with no set endpoint, but in
peacemaking. Since | had the good fortune to be part of the informal inner circle
with which he discussed the potential opportunities, pitfalls and frustrations
along the way, I know that he wasn’t assuming we could necessarily achieve a
peace agreement with any of our neighbors. But after the twin shocks of the
Lebanon War and the Scud missiles, he was concerned that Israel would retreat
into a mix of political caution and military deterrence which he rightly believed
was short-sighted. He believed we needed at least to try to seize a “window of
opportunity” with those enemies who were at least open to compromise, if only
because we were facing new threats from enemies for whom talk was not even
an option. An increasingly assertive Iran, with nuclear ambitions, was one. But
the intifada had also thrown up new Palestinian groups grounded not in
nationalism, but fundamentalist Islam: Hamas in Gaza, which opposed Israel’s
presence on any part of “Muslim Palestine,” and Islamic Jihad on the West
Bank. And in Lebanon, we were confronting the Iranian-backed Shi’ ite militia
fighters of Hizbollah.

Each of us in the small group on whom Rabin relied for input on the peace
talks brought something different to the mix. In addition to me, there were four
other generals: Uri Saguy, the head of military intelligence; Gadi Zohar, in
charge of civil administration for the West Bank and Gaza; my own former
sayeret deputy, Danny Yatom, who was head of the central command; and
Rabin’s military aide, Kuti Mor. Also included were longtime political and
media aide Eitan Haber, and another trusted political adviser thousands of miles
away: Itamar Rabinovich, our ambassador in Washington and Israel’s leading
Syria expert. But I’m sure we weren’t chosen just for our insights. It was

Other organizations have attempted to solve the liabil-
ity/immunity problem by turning to multilateral, not
single-nation, solutions. The UN, for instance, has
agreed to “make provisions for appropriate modes of set-
tlement of ... [d]isputes arising out of contracts or other
disputes of a private law character.” Convention on Privi-
leges and Immunities of the United Nations, Art. VIII,
§29, 21 U.S. T. 1488, T. I. A.S. No. 6900. It generally
does so by agreeing to submit commercial disputes to
arbitration. See Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations
Law of the United States §467, Reporters’ Note 7 (1987).
Other organizations, including the IFC, have set up alter-
native accountability schemes to resolve disputes that
might otherwise end up in court. See World Bank, Inspec-
tion Panel: About Us (deseribing World Bank’s three-
member “independent complaints mechanism” for those
“who believe that they have been ... adversely affected by

And, if so, the Immunities Act itself offers a way for Amer-

what is inside each egg by shaking and listening to the sound
generated. After he takes a first guess, show him the list of what
items are in each egg and have him guess again. See if he changes
his mind about some of the previous guesses. Now open the eggs
and see how close the guesses were to what was actually inside
each egg.

Now, let’s make a musical instrument called a kazoo. Cut a
small square of wax paper about 1 inch larger than the end of the
cardboard tube. After doing that, wrap the wax paper over one
of the ends of the tube and put a rubber band over the paper to
hold it in place. Now, put the open end of your kazoo up to your
mouth and hum a tune into it. Notice how the kazoo buzzes and
vibrates to amplify (make louder) the sound of your voice.

Of course, this is not exactly what I have in mind when I suggest focus-
ing school on experimentation. Say the word experiment and the word
science usually follows right away. This is unfortunate because most
kids won’t become scientists any time soon. Also, most kids already
know what they are being asked to “experiment” about. They know
the pencil falls and they know you can make noise by blowing through
things. They may not understand how all this works, but they won’t
understand much mote after doing these so-called “experiments.”

Experiments in the larger sense are about attempts to find out
what is true about things you are uncertain about. The issue is how
to do that when you are wondering about something. To do this we
need to constantly deal with what kids are worrying about and ask
them to determine how they can find out what is true. This is experi-
mentation that can be helped by teachers. It needs to be individually
focused, however. You can’t have a class worry collectively about any
one thing. Each kid has his own concerns,

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021387.txt,"reproduce... one consequence is
that selfish genes evolved
through individual-level selection
processes to promote social
preferences and group processes,
including reciprocal social
behaviors, that can extend
beyond kin relationships

The concept of inclusive fitness helps to
explain why humans care for the young
when they are sick, and even why they
care for those who when healthy are able
to contribute to caring for the young. In
addition, it may be that hunter-gatherers
were more likely to survive and
reproduce when they cared for a
wounded or sickened member of the
clan—thereby establishing an
expectation of reciprocity that would
contribute to social cohesion, collective
effort, and defense of other group
members. These provide at least the
rudiments of an evolutionary rationale
for the practice of medicine.

Yet, medicine does not involve
caring merely (or even primarily) for the
young, much less for those who are most
genetically fit. Rather, medicine in large
measure involves caring for those who
either have no capacity to contribute to
the gene pool because they are aged and
otherwise infertile, or whose
contributions to that pool will reduce
population fitness because they are
genetically predisposed to sickness and
disability. Concern about the latter led
Francis Galton and many of his
American and European contemporaries
to embrace social Darwinism and to
champion efforts to keep the diminished
and infirm from reproducing. In the
United States, the eugenics movement
was memorialized in the infamous words
of Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes, who justified the
constitutionality of the forced

sterilization of mentally ‘unfit’ women
in the case of Buck v. Bell by writing,
“Three generations of imbeciles are
enough.” Sterilization rates under
eugenic laws in the United States
increased following this ruling until the
Skinner v. Oklahoma case in 1942, after
which point they declined.

The practice of medicine
expresses more than a straightforward
social instinct for protecting the young.
To borrow from Browning, it may be
that medicine builds on and extends the
dynamic of inclusive fitness much like in
Catholic moral theology caritas (love)
builds on and extends eros (desire).
Browning writes, “[Aquinas] held — and
Christianity has always taught — that
Christian love includes more than kin
altruism and the care of our familial
offspring; it must include the love of
neighbor, stranger, and enemy, even to
the point of self-sacrifice.” The
theological concept of God as creator
and Father of all “made it possible for
Christians to build on yet analogically
generalize their kin altruism to all
children of God, even those beyond the
immediate family, their own children
and their own kin.” Even those beyond
the reasonable hope of reproducing or
helping others to reproduce.

Notably, the self-conscious
commitments that animate medicine do
not include promoting population fitness
or ensuring survival of offspring to the
point of reproduction. Rather, physicians
discipline themselves to practices that
make possible the commitment of
medicine: to preserve and restore the
health of patients, notwithstanding
patients’ other characteristics. Religions
ground this care for the sick in sacred
and transcendent obligations to God and
neighbor, and it is not incidental that the
hospital began when Christian monastic

Management as a Quasi-Owner

Owners (shareholders) typically allow management wide latitude to cope with
needs. It stands in place of owners. Accounting tradition, and this book too, reasons
out the steps from revenue to dividend yield as if management itself were the owner.
Otherwise there would be little to say. From the shareholder viewpoint, revenue is

simply dividend yield.

But the bottom line is the same. The maximand is output, or growth plus cash flow.
Positive cash flow, in the sense net of plowback, is dividend yield on both the firm’s
books and the shareholder’s. Negative cash flow on the books of shareholders
individually is purchase of any shares in the same firm. On the books of
shareholders collectively, where sales and purchases of existing shares offset, it
simplifies to purchase of new stock issues alone. This too is just as on the books of

the firm.

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $6.50 price
objective. We assign a 1.0x multiple to our 2Q17E TBV, below the 1.6X for peers, due to
the overhang of PR fiscal issues that may reduce TBV. Our revised implied 2Q17E TBV
of 1.0x is consistent with a 5% ROE. We assign a 10x multiple to our 2017E EPS, in line
with peers. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 10% and a terminal growth
rate of 3%.

Downside risks to our price objective are a worse-than-expected restructuring of PR
government debt, deterioration in the Puerto Rican economy that could hurt the ongoing
credit and earnings recovery at FBP, a change in management's strategy to dispose
troubled assets, and potential regulatory risk stemming from the ongoing
implementation of the Dodd-Frank financial rules. Upside risks to our price objective are
a much stronger economic improvement in Puerto Rico and a better-than-expected
improvement in asset quality trends at FBP.

First Hawaiian Inc. (FHB)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our $31 PO
and assign a 2.2x multiple to 2017E TBV and 17x multiple on 2017E EPS, representing
premium target multiples for the median smid-cap banks under coverage. We have
weighted the P/E and P/TBV factors equally.

A superior profitability profile suggests an above peer multiple. Our DCF assumes a two-
stage cost of capital of 8% and a terminal growth rate of 4%.

Risks include 1) FHB's reliance on the Hawaiian economy with 80% of the franchise
spread across Hawaii, Guam, and Saipan poses downside risk to EPS from a severe
economic downturn in this region. 2) While FHB has a history of conservative
underwriting its exposure to auto loans could serve as an overhang if investor concerns
around the health of the auto sector and consumer increase. 3) Expectations for
continued divestiture by French bank BNP (owns 82% of shares o/s) could temper stock
performance.

First Horizon National Corp. (FHN)

We use a three-prong valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our $16 price
objective and assign a 1.5x multiple to 2Q17E TBV and a 14x multiple to 2017E EPS
(inline with median for our mid-to-small cap universe). We believe that this valuation
discount is warranted given the below average earnings growth that we forecast for
FHN. Our P/TBV and P/E targets reflect our expectation that earnings growth and
profitability will remain challenged by a low growth low interest rate environment. Our
DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 5%.

Downside risks to our price objective are a double dip in home prices and slower
residential real estate recovery. Upside risks are FHN being taken out above our price
objective and better performance in the economy than we expect.

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $36 price
objective and assign a 1.8x multiple to our 2Q17E TBV, given that we believe the market
would pay no premium for FSB's 2016 estimated returns of 14%, below the median of

Honorable Mark Filip 
Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
United States Department of Justice 
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20530 
Dear Judge Filip: 
Joe D. Whitley 
Alston & Bird LLP 
The Atlantic Building 
950 F Street, NW 
Washington, DC 2000 -1 04 
CONFIDENTIAL 
In his confirmation hearings last fall, Judge Mukasey admirably lifted up the finest 
traditions of the Department of Justice in assuring the United States Senate, and the American 
people, of his solemn intent to ensure fairness and integrity in the administration of justice. Your 
own confirmation hearings echoed that bedrock determination to assure that the Department 
conduct itself with honor and integrity, especially in the enforcement of federal criminal law. 
We come to you in that spirit and respectfully ask for a review of the federal involvement 
in a quintessentially state matter involving our client, Jeffrey Epstein. While we are well aware 
of the rare instances in which a review of this sort is justified, we are confident that the 
circumstances at issue warrant such an examination. Based on our collective experiences, as 
well as those of other former senior Justice Department officials whose advice we have sought, 
we have never before seen a case more appropriate for oversight and review. Thus, while neither 
of us has previously made such a request, we do so now in the recognition that both the 
Department's reputation, as well as the due process rights of our client, are at issue. 
Recently, the Criminal Division concluded a very limited review of this matter at the 
request of U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta. Critically, however, this review deliberately excluded 
many important aspects of this case. Just this past Friday, on May 16, 2008, we received a letter 
from the head of CEOS informing us that CEOS had conducted a review of this case. By its own 
admission, the CEOS review was limited, both factually and legally. Part of the self-imposed 
limitation was CEOS's abstention from addressing our allegations of professional misconduct 
by federal prosecutors—even though such misconduct was, as we contend it is, inextricably 
intertwined with the credibility of the accusations being made against Mr. Epstein by the United 
States Attorney's Office in Miami (USAO). Moreover, CEOS did not assess the terms of the 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement now in effect, nor did CEOS review the federal prosecutors' 
inappropriate efforts to implement those terms. We detail this point below. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 010723 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 2 
By way of background, we were informed by Mr. Acosta that, at his request, CEOS 
would be conducting a review to determine whether federal prosecution was both appropriate 
and, in his words, fair. That is not what occurred. Instead, CEOS has now acknowledged that 
we had raised many compelling arguments against the USAO's suggested novel application 
of federal law in this matter. Even so, CEOS concluded, in minimalist fashion, that we do not 
see anything that says to us categorically that a federal case should not be brought and that the 
U.S. Attorney would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he authorize federal 
prosecution of Mr. Epstein thus delegating back to Mr. Acosta the decision of whether federal 
prosecution was warranted (emphasis added). Rather than assessing whether prosecution would 
be appropriate, CEOS, using a low baseline for its evaluation, determined only that it would not 
be impossible to prove . . . certain allegations made against Mr. Epstein. The CEOS review 
failed to address the significant problems involving the appearance of impermissible selectivity 
that would necessarily result from a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein. 
We respect CEOS 's conclusion that its authority to review misconduct issues was 
precluded by Criminal Division practice. We further respect CEOS 's view that it understood its 
mission as significantly limited. Specifically, the contemplated objective was to determine 
whether the USAO would be abusing its discretion by bringing a federal prosecution rather than 
making its own de novo recommendations on the appropriate reach of federal law. However, we 
respectfully submit that a full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of the 
Justice Department. In an effort to inform you of the nature of the federal investigation against 
Mr. Epstein, we summarize the facts and circumstances of this matter below. 
The two base-level concerns we hold are that (1) federal prosecution of this matter is not 
warranted based on the purely-local conduct and the unprecedented application of federal 
statutes to facts such as these and (2) the actions of federal authorities are both highly 
questionable and give rise to an appearance of substantial impropriety. The issues that we have 
raised, but which have not yet been addressed or resolved by the Department, are more than 
isolated allegations of professional mistakes or misconduct. These issues, instead, affect the 
appearance and administration of criminal justice with profound consequences beyond the 
resolution in the matter at hand. 
In a precedent-shattering investigation of Jeffrey Epstein that raises important policy 
questions—and serious issues as to the fair and honorable enforcement of federal law—the 
USA° in Miami is considering extending federal law beyond the bounds of precedent and 
reason. Federal prosecutors stretched the underlying facts in ways that raise fundamental 
questions of basic professionalism. Perhaps most troubling, the USA° in Miami, as a condition 
of deferring prosecution, required a commingling of substantive federal criminal law with a 
proposed civil remedy engineered in a way that appears intended to profit particular lawyers in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 010724 
Honorable Mark Filip

private practice in South Florida with personal relationships to some of the prosecutors involved. 
Federal prosecutors then leaked highly sensitive information about the case to a New York 
Times reporter.' The immediate result of this confluence of extraordinary circumstances is an 
onslaught of civil lawsuits, all save one brought by the First Assistant's former boutique law firm 
in Miami. 
The facts in this case all revolve around the classic state crime of solicitation of 
prostitution.2 The State Attorney's Office in Palm Beach County had conducted a diligent 
investigation, convened a Grand Jury that returned an indictment, and made a final determination 
about how to proceed. That is where, in our federal republic, this matter should rest. 
Mr. Epstein faces a felony conviction in state court by virtue of his conduct, and the only reason 
the State has not resolved this matter is that the federal prosecutors in Miami have continued to 
insist that we, Mr. Epstein's counsel, approach and demand from the State Attorney's Office a 
harsher charge and a more severe punishment than that Office believes are appropriate under the 
circumstances. Yet despite the USAO's refusal to allow the State to resolve this matter on the 
terms the State has determined are appropriate, the USA() has not made any attempt to 
coordinate its efforts with the State. In fact, the USAO mandated that any federal agreement 
would be conditioned on Mr. Epstein persuading the State to seek a criminal punishment unlike 
that imposed on other defendants within the jurisdiction of the State Attorney for similar 
conduct. 
From the inception of the USAO's involvement in this case, which at the end of the day 
is a case about solicitation of prostitution within the confines of Palm Beach County, Florida, we 
have asked ourselves why the Department of Justice is involved. Regrettably, we are unable to 
suggest any appropriate basis for the Department's involvement. Mr. Epstein has no criminal 
history whatsoever. Also, Mr. Epstein has never been the subject of general media interest until 
a few years ago, after it was widely perceived by the public that he was a close friend of former 
President Bill Clinton. 
The conduct at issue is simply not within the purview of federal jurisdiction and lies 
outside the heartland of the three federal statutes that have been identified by prosecutors-18 
U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b). 
1 One of the other members of Mr. Epstein's defense team, Jay Leflcowitz, has personally reviewed the reporter's 
contemporaneous notes. 
2 Although some of the women alleged to be involved were 16 and 17 years of age, several of these women 
openly admitted to lying to Mr. Epstein about their age in their recent sworn statements. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 010725 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 4 
These statutes are intended to target crimes of a truly national and international scope. 
Specifically, § 1591 was enacted to combat human trafficking, § 2422 is aimed at sexual 
predation of minors through the Internet, and § 2423 deals with sex tourism. The nature of these 
crimes results in multi-jurisdictional problems that state and local authorities cannot effectively 
confront on their own. However, Mr. Epstein's conduct was purely local in nature and, thus, 
does not implicate federal involvement. After researching every reported case brought under 18 
U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b), we found that not a single case involves facts or a 
scenario similar to the situation at hand. Our review of each precedent reflects that there have 
been no reported prosecutions under § 1591 of a'john' whose conduct with a minor lacked 
force, coercion, or fraud and who was not profiting from commercial sexual trafficking. There 
have likewise been no cases under § 2422(b)—a crime of communication—where there was no 
use of the Internet, and where the content of phone communications did not contain any inducing 
or enticing of a minor to have illegal sexual activity as expressly required by the language of the 
statute. Furthermore, the Government's contention that routine and habit can fill the factual 
and legal void created by the lack of evidence that such a communication ever occurred sets this 
case apart from every reported case brought under § 2422(b). Lastly, there are no reported cases 
of violations of § 2423(b) of a person whose dominant purpose in traveling was merely to go to 
his own home.3 
Although these matters were within the scope of the CEOS review, rather than 
considering whether federal prosecution is appropriate, CEOS only determined that U.S. 
Attorney Acosta would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he authorize federal 
prosecution in this case. The abuse of discretion standard constitutes an extremely low bar of 
evaluation and while it may be appropriate when the consideration of issues are exclusively 
factual in nature, this standard fails to address concerns particular to this situation, namely the 
novel application of federal statutes. The abuse of discretion standard in such pure legal 
matters of statutory application risks causing a lack of uniformity. The same federal statutes that 
would be stretched beyond their bounds in Miami have been limited to their heartland in each of 
the other federal districts. Also, because this case implicates broader issues of the administration 
of equal justice, federal prosecution in this matter risks the appearance of selectivity in its 
stretching of federal law to fit these facts. 
3 
Federal prosecution of a man who engaged in consensual conduct in his home that amounted to, at most, the 
solicitation of prostitution, is unprecedented. Since prostitution is fundamentally a state concern, (see United 
States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, n.1 (11th Cir. 2007) (federal law does not criminalize all acts of prostitution (a 
vice traditionally governed by state regulation))), and there is no evidence that Palm Beach County authorities 
and Florida prosecutors cannot effectively prosecute and punish the conduct, there is no reason why this matter 
should be extracted from the hands of state prosecutors in Florida.

Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008

In fact, recent testimony of several alleged victims contradicts claims made by federal 
prosecutors during the negotiations of a deferred prosecution agreement. The consistent 
representations of key Government witnesses (such as 
and ) confirm the following critical points: First, there was no 
communication, telephonic or otherwise, that meets the requirements of § 2422(b). For instance, 
Ms. Gonzalez confirmed that Mr. Epstein never emailed, text-messaged, or used any facility of 
interstate commerce whatsoever, before or after her one (and only) visit to his home. 
Tr. (deposition) at 30. Second, the women who testified admitted that they lied to Mr. Epstein 
about their age in order to gain admittance into his home. Indeed, the women who brought their 
underage friends to Mr. Epstein testified that they would counsel their friends to lie about their 
ages as well. stated the following: I would tell my girlfriends just like 
approached me. Make sure you tell him you're 18. Well, these girls that I brought, I know that 
they were 18 or 19 or 20. And the girls that I didn't know and I don't know if they were lying or 
not, I would say make sure that you tell him you're 18. _____________________ Third, there was no 
routine or habit of improper communication expressing an intent to transform a massage into an 
illegal act. In fact, there was often no sexual activity at all during the massage. 
testified that [s]ometimes [Mr. Epstein] just wanted his feet massaged. Sometimes he 
just wanted a back massage. also stated that Mr. Epstein_ 
never touched [her] physically and that all she did was massage[ ] his back, his chest and his 
thighs and that was it. 1____________________________ Finally, there was no force, coercion, fraud, 
violence, drugs, or even alcohol present in connection with Mr. Epstein's encounters with these 
women. stated that [Mr. Epstein] never tried to force me to do anything. 
at 12. These accounts are far from the usual testimony in sex slavery, Internet stings and sex 
tourism cases previously brought. The women in actuality were not younger than 16, which is 
the age of consent in most of the 50 states, and the sex activity was irregular and in large part, 
consisted of solo self-pleasuring. 
The recent crop of civil suits brought against Mr. Epstein confirm that the plaintiffs did 
not discuss any sexually-related activities with anyone prior to arriving at Mr. Epstein's 
residence. This reinforces our contention that no telephonic or Internet persuasion, inducement, 
enticement or coercion of a minor, or of any other individual, occurred. In addition, Mr. Jeffrey 
Herman, the former law partner of one of the federal prosecutors involved in this matter and the 
attorney for most of the civil complainants (as described in detail below), was quoted in the Palm 
Beach Post as saying that it doesn't matter that his clients lied about their ages and told Mr. 
Epstein that they were 18 or 19. 
Not only is a federal prosecution of this matter unwarranted, but the irregularity of 
conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the deferred prosecution agreement are 
beyond any reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor's responsibilities. The list of 
improprieties includes, but is not limited to, the following facts: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 010727 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 6 
• Federal prosecutors made the unprecedented demand that Mr. Epstein pay a 
minimum of $150,000 per person to an unnamed list of women they referred to as 
minors and whom they insisted required representation by a guardian ad litem. Mr. 
Epstein's counsel later established that all but one of these individuals were actually 
adults, not minors. Even then, though demanding payment to the women, the 
USAO eventually asserted that it could not vouch for the veracity of any of the 
claims that these women might make. 
• Federal prosecutors made the highly unusual demand that Mr. Epstein pay the fees 
of a civil attorney chosen by the prosecutors to represent these alleged victims 
should they choose to bring any civil litigation against him. They also proposed 
sending a notice to the alleged victims, stating, in an underlined sentence, that 
should they choose their own attorney, Mr. Epstein would not be required to pay 
their fees. The prosecutors further demanded that Mr. Epstein waive his right to 
challenge any of the allegations made by these victims. 
• The Assistant U.S. Attorney involved in this matter recommended for the civil 
attorney, a highly lucrative position, an individual that we later discovered was 
closely and personally connected to the Assistant U.S. Attorney's own boyfriend. 
• Federal prosecutors represented to Mr. Epstein's counsel that they had identified 
(and later rechecked and re-identified) several alleged victims of federal crimes 
that qualified for payment under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, a civil remedy designed to 
provide financial benefits to victims. Only through state discovery provisions did 
we later learn that many of the women on the rechecked victim list could not 
possibly qualify under § 2255. The reason is that they, themselves, testified that 
they did not suffer any type of harm whatsoever, a prerequisite for the civil recovery 
under § 2255. Moreover, these women stated that they did not, now or in the past, 
consider themselves to be victims. 
• During the last few months, Mr. Herman, First Assistant Sloman's former law 
partner, has filed several civil lawsuits against Mr. Epstein on behalf of the alleged 
victims. It is our understanding that each of Mr. Herman's clients are on the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 010728 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 7 
Government's confidential list of victims. Most of these lawsuits seek $50 
million in money damages.4 
• Assistant U.S. Attorney David Weinstein spoke about the case in great detail to 
Landon Thomas, a reporter with the New York Times, and revealed confidential 
information about the Government's allegations against Mr. Epstein. The Assistant 
U.S. Attorney also revealed the substance of confidential plea negotiations. 
• When counsel for Mr. Epstein complained about the media leaks, First Assistant 
Sloman responded by asserting that Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant to his 
request, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes. Based 
on Mr. Thomas' contemporaneous notes, that assertion appears to be false. For 
example, Mr. Weinstein told Mr. Thomas that federal authorities believed that 
Mr. Epstein had lured girls over the telephone and traveled in interstate commerce 
for the purpose of engaging in underage sex. He recounted to Mr. Thomas the 
USAO's theory of prosecution against Mr. Epstein, replete with an analysis of the 
key statutes being considered. Furthermore, after Mr. Epstein's defense team 
complained about the leak to the USAO, Mr. Weinstein, in Mr. Thomas' own 
description, then admonished him for talking to the defense, and getting him in 
trouble. Mr. Weinstein further told him not to believe the spin of Mr. Epstein's 
high-priced attorneys, and then, according to Mr. Thomas, Mr. Weinstein 
forcefully reminded Mr. Thomas that all prior conversations were merely 
hypothetical. 
We are constrained to conclude that the actions of federal officials in this case strike at 
the heart of one of the vitally important, enduring values in this country: the honest enforcement 
of federal law, free of political considerations and free of the taint of personal financial 
motivations on the part of federal prosecutors that, at a minimum, raise the appearance of serious 
impropriety. 
We were told by U.S. Attorney Acosta that as part of the review he requested, the 
Department had the authority, and his consent, to make any determination it deemed appropriate 
regarding this matter, including a decision to decline federal prosecution. Yet, CEOS's only 
conclusion, based on its limited review of the investigation, is that U.S. Attorney Acosta would 
not abuse his discretion by proceeding against Mr. Epstein. Thus, the decision of whether 
As recently as two months ago, Mr. Sloman was still listed publicly as a part of his former law firm. While we 
assume this was an oversight, Mr. Sloman's identification as part of the firm raises the appearance of 
impropriety.

prosecution is fair and appropriate has been placed, once again, in U.S. Attorney Acosta's 
hands. 
In light of the foregoing, we respectfully ask that you review this matter and discontinue 
all federal involvement so that the State can appropriately bring this matter to closure. We 
would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss these important issues. 
Such a meeting would provide the Department with an opportunity to review the paramount 
issues of federalism and the appearance of selectivity that are generated by the unprecedented 
attempts to broaden the ambit of federal statutes to places that they have never before reached.

countries. Like Snowden, she also deemed herself, tongue and cheek, a “super hero.” In this
sense, her Internet avatar, was a match for Snowden’s “Wolfking Awesomefox,”

In Japan, Mills and Snowden spent time with another American couple, Jennie and Joseph
Chamberlin, who also worked at the Yokota base. Jennie, a sergeant in the public affairs section
of the US Air force, had been at Art College with Mills, and called herself in her blog the “Little
Red Ninja.” Her husband, Joseph Chamberlin was a decorated US Navy pilot who now flew
highly-sensitive intelligence-gathering missions from the Yokota base. When Lindsay Mills
arrived she made contact with Jennie, who in the next few weeks showed her many of the sights
of Tokyo. Jennie described Lindsay in her blog as her “super-model friend.” The two couples
also went on expeditions in Japan together. Joseph Chamberlin had a car and, as far as is known,
he and his wife were the only Americans at the base with whom Snowden socialized. On August
17, 2009, the foursome attempted to walk up Mount Fuji, but they got lost en route to the tourist
site. Giving up on Mount Fuji, they wound up in the Mount Fuji gift shop. Jennie described the
misadventure in her Little Red Ninja blog: “Our adventure started off a little rocky with our
attempts to find the interstate. Alas, our iconic mountain was obscured by cloud. A short stop at
the Mt. Fuji combination soba noodle stand/gift shop was enough to whet our appetite for the
further exploration that is to come.” The photographs that day show Snowden wearing Hawaiian
shorts, and a black tank top emblazoned with an eagle and the letters USA. They also show Mills
wearing safari shorts, a brown sweater and what appears to be an engagement ring (possibly to
allay suspicions about her living with Snowden.) “Ed was looking rather rednecky,” Lindsay
commented on one the photograph. Snowden described her, in turn, as “nerdy.” Finally, after
posing for photographs, they found the Suyama-guchi path. But they never made it to the top.

Back in Tokyo, Snowden was still seeking to advance himself. He attempted to get a
college certificate by enrolling in a summer on-line course at the University of Maryland’s Asia
program. But, according to the program’s record, he did not succeed in receiving any credit or a
certificate from the on-line University.

Finally, in October 2009, Dell assigned Snowden a job in which he had direct access to the
NSA’s computers. His new position was a system administrator, which is essentially a tech-savvy
repairman. Dell was working on backup system code-named EPIC SHELTER. For this contract,
Dell was transferring large chunks of data from the NSA’s main computers in Maryland to back-
up drives in Japan so if there was a communications interruption the system could be quickly
restored. Since most of the classified data was in its encrypted form, it had little value to any
outside party. Snowden’s job was to maintain the proper functioning of computers but, as a
system administrator, he also had privileges to call up unencrypted files. He sat in front of a
computer screen all day looking for any problems in the transferring files to back-up servers. The
work was highly-repetitive and exceedingly dull. Snowden found time to search for anomalies in
the system and he claimed to have spotted a major flaw in the security system in late 2009. The
flaw was that a system administrator in Japan worked as a singleton and could steal secret data

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012903.txt,"Preface

This is a large, two-part book with an even larger goal: To outline a practical approach to
engineering software systems with general intelligence at the human level and ultimately beyond.
Machines with flexible problem-solving ability, open-ended learning capability, creativity and
eventually, their own kind of genius.

Part 1, this volume, reviews various critical conceptual issues related to the nature of intel-
ligence and mind. It then sketches the broad outlines of a novel, integrative architecture for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGT) called CogPrime ... and describes an approach for giving a
young AGI system (CogPrime or otherwise) appropriate experience, so that it can develop its
own smarts, creativity and wisdom through its own experience. Along the way a formal theory
of general intelligence is sketched, and a broad roadmap leading from here to human-level arti-
ficial intelligence. Hints are also given regarding how to eventually, potentially create machines
advancing beyond human level — including some frankly futuristic speculations about strongly
self-modifying AGI architectures with flexibility far exceeding that of the human brain.

Part 2 then digs far deeper into the details of CogPrime’s multiple structures, processes and
functions, culminating in a general argument as to why we believe CogPrime will be able to
achieve general intelligence at the level of the smartest humans (and potentially greater), and
a detailed discussion of how a CogPrime-powered virtual agent or robot would handle some
simple practical tasks such as social play with blocks in a preschool context. It first describes
the CogPrime software architecture and knowledge representation in detail; then reviews the
cognitive cycle via which CogPrime perceives and acts in the world and reflects on itself; and
next turns to various forms of learning: procedural, declarative (e.g. inference), simulative and
integrative. Methods of enabling natural language functionality in CogPrime are then discussed;
and then the volume concludes with a chapter summarizing the argument that CogPrime can
lead to human-level (and eventually perhaps greater) AGI, and a chapter giving a thought
experiment describing the internal dynamics via which a completed CogPrime system might
solve the problem of obeying the request “Build me something with blocks that I haven’t seen
before.”

The chapters here are written to be read in linear order — and if consumed thus, they tell
a coherent story about how to get from here to advanced AGI. However, the impatient reader
may be forgiven for proceeding a bit nonlinearly. An alternate reading path for the impatient
reader would be to start with the first few chapters of Part 1, then skim the final two chapters of
Part 2, and then return to reading in linear order. The final two chapters of Part 2 give a broad
overview of why we think the CogPrime design will work, in a way that depends on the technical

Initial ideas:

* Expand the first episode “Mathematics and Truth” into two or likely three episodes. I’m intrigued by this
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner’s
‘unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)’, astrophysics, cosmology, biology, general
systems theory. I’ve felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think three episodes
could work - if you agree, Ill get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 parts. Also, Closer
To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 episodes!), so

this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the series.

* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un of Wisconsin-
Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory.

* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my
expertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you

need to tell me if you would like to include this.

* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability in biomedical
and especially psychological research - the scandal in recent years. See links and attachments.

the state, the model Israel mother or father were those who stood silent and strong
as a soldier’s coffin was lowered into the ground.

Nechemia’s death hurt, of course. I was friends not just with him, but his older
brother, Eliezer. Known by his army nickname, Cheetah, he was in charge of the
air force’s main helicopter squadron. He had flown both me and Nechemia on
sayeret missions into the Sinai. Several days after the war was over, before
returning to university, I drove up to Jerusalem to see his family. Cheetah was at
the door when I arrived. Neither of us spoke. But as we embraced, I could feel
my eyes dampen, and there were tears in his eyes as well.

“Our squadron was the one that got the call to bring out the casualties,” he
said. “They ordered the pilot who brought out Nechemia not to tell me he was
dead... until the war was over.”

“He was a wonderful man,” I said. “There was no one better.”

When I returned to Hebrew University, the country felt completely different.
It was not just the sudden realization that, in military terms, Israel had
eliminated any realistic threat to its existence, important though that was. The
more profound change was physical. The country in which I’d grown up was a
place which felt not just small, but pinched, especially in its “narrow waist” near
Mishmar Hasharon. Pre-1967 Israel was about three-quarters the size of the
state of New Hampshire. Now, within the space of less than a week, the
territory Israel controlled had more than tripled. It included the whole Sinai
Desert, up to the edge of the Suez Canal. The entire Golan. The ancient lands of
Judaea and Samaria: the West Bank. And the reunited capital city of Jerusalem.

Suddenly, we had a sense that we could breathe. Wander, explore. Few of
my classmates were religiously observant. But none of us could help feel the
sense of connection as we walked through the Old City of Jerusalem, or parts of
the West Bank whose place-names resonated from the Bible. I felt especially
moved when I first visited the Old City with my friends, stopping and chatting
and buying things at the colorful market stalls. And, religious or not, when I
stood in front of the surviving Western Wall of the ancient Jewish temple.

Cc CHAPTER IX Cannabis Industry Risk Factors

¢ There is currently a lack of broad interstate reciprocity with respect to cannabis laws.

¢ Even in states where cannabis is legal under state law, local jurisdictions may impose bans or
restrictions that materially interfere with or effectively prevent the operation of cannabis busi-
nesses within their boundaries.

Risks Related to the Manufacture and Sale of Cannabis Products

¢ Cannabis companies are exposed to various product liability claims associated with human con-
sumption of cannabis products, including claims that products cause injury, illness, possible side
effects or interactions with other substances, or that products include inadequate instructions for
use or warnings concerning health risks.

* Cannabis companies may be subject to product recalls for a variety of reasons, including product
defects, such as contamination. Such recalls may result in financial burdens and reputational
harm and may subject cannabis companies to increased regulatory scrutiny.

* Consumer perception of cannabis products can be significantly influenced by scientific research
or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding
the consumption of cannabis. Any unfavorable developments in these areas could have a material
adverse effect on the demand for cannabis products in general or on the products or prospects of
a particular company.

Risks Related to Early-Stage Cannabis Companies

* Most cannabis companies are in early stages of development and have limited operational his-
tory, so it is difficult to accurately predict and forecast their business operations. Many cannabis
companies will fail.

¢ The success of many early-stage cannabis companies is premised on receiving and maintaining
the licenses, permits and regulatory approvals required for their proposed cannabis activities.
Many of such companies will not receive or maintain such licenses, permits and approvals or may
be able to do so only at significant expense.

* Cannabis companies’ access to the capital required to grow and to finance ongoing operations
involves challenges particular to the industry's uncertain and rapidly evolving legal landscape.
Many early-stage companies in the cannabis industry will not be able to obtain the requisite
capital or will run out of capital prior to reaching profitability.

° Early-stage cannabis companies may experience unexpected problems in the areas of product
development and quality, manufacturing, marketing and general management, which, in some
cases, cannot be adequately solved. Companies may also be subject to product pricing and cost
pressures and to claims of intellectual property infringement.

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation may face a serious legal obstacle: It is tainted by
antecedent political bias. The June 14 report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s
inspector general, unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking officials at the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. Some of their communications, the report says, were “not only indicative of a
biased state of mind but imply a willingness to take action to impact a presidential candidate’s electoral
prospects.” Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain whether this bias “directly
affected” specific FBI actions in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, it nonetheless affects the

legality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named Crossfire Hurricane.

Crossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its FBI progenitors—the same ones who
had investigated Mrs. Clinton—deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign advisers,
obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wiretap warrants, issued national security letters to
gather records, and unmasked the identities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They also

repeatedly leaked investigative information.

Mr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn’t expected to finish for months. But the
current report reveals that FBI officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald
Trump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Trump
investigations, confidently assuaged a colleague’s fear that Mr. Trump would become president: “No
he won’t. We’|l stop it.” An unnamed FBI lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was
“devastated” and “numb” after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to another FBI attorney: “Viva le

resistance.”

The report highlights the FBI’s failure to act promptly upon discovering that Anthony Weiner’s laptop
contained thousands of Mrs. Clinton’s emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the “higher
priority” of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz writes: “We did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to
prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on [the] investigative lead discovered on the

Weiner laptop was free from bias.”

Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey was trying
to influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the
inspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was motivated

by a desire to protect her assumed presidency’s legitimacy.

The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok’s text messages “created the appearance that investigative

decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.” The report adds, importantly, that “most

67. Dershowitz lied and said he never saw any naked pictures of females in Epstein’s
Palm Beach home during his many visits, yet the police footage that was obtained from the
search of Epstein’s home proves that there were naked pictures of females throughout the home
including in the common areas.

68. In adesperate attempt to deflect attention from his own misconduct, Dershowitz
fabricated an extortion plot by Roberts and her lawyers. Dershowitz falsely told the media that
he was being used as a pawn as part of a fanciful plan to extort money from a billionaire business
mogul and colleague of Epstein. Dershowitz’s claim was that he was framed in order to send a
message to the billionaire that this is what would happen to the billionaire if the billionaire did
not pay Roberts and her attorneys. As Dershowitz knew:

(a) No complaint was ever made against the billionaire.

(b) No money was either paid or demanded by or from the billionaire.

(c) Roberts’ assertions about Dershowitz long predated the time of the alleged
extortion plot.

69. Dershowitz also falsely claimed that Roberts’ lawyer had told him that he had
concluded that Roberts was “wrong” and “simply wrong” in accusing Dershowitz. Dershowitz,
in violation of the canons of ethics and in at least one case in violation of state law, had
surreptitiously tape recorded confidential settlement negotiations he had engaged in with Ms.
Roberts’ lawyer. Dershowitz then played and described excerpts from those tapes out of context
to reporters to try to make it appear that Ms. Roberts’ lawyer’s hypothetical comments, and
characterizations of Dershowitz’s assertions, represented that lawyer’s conclusions. As the sworn
testimony (Exhibit 13) of Dershowitz’s own lawyer, and the facts set forth below, demonstrate,

Dershowitz’s assertions about what Ms. Roberts’ lawyer said are, again, false.

Attorney’s position — because those documents remained under seal.

The prosecution of Epstein has remained in the news and was recently the subject ofa
wide-ranging investigation by the Miami Herald, which was published on November 28, 2018.
Id. Ex. A. One of several in-depth feature articles published by the Miami Herald was entitled
“Cops worked to put serial sex abuser in prison. Prosecutors worked to cut him a break.” Jd. In
that article, the Miami Herald reported that investigators uncovered evidence that Epstein had
abused “over 100 middle school and high school aged girls,” but “despite ample physical
evidence and multiple witnesses corroborating the girls’ stories, federal prosecutors and
Epstein’s lawyers quietly put together a remarkable deal for Epstein.” Jd. Epstein agreed to
plead guilty to soliciting an underage prostitute “in state court, and in exchange, he and his
accomplices received immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to
prison for life. Jd. More troubling still, Epstein’s case file was sealed — including a detailed
criminal complaint — so that “no one . . . could know the full scope of Epstein’s crimes and who
else was involved.” Jd.

The Miami Herald’s reporting has also had serious political ramifications. As the Miami
Herald has reported, “[t]he U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, was personally involved
in the negotiations” back in and around 2008. Jd. Ex. C. Acosta subsequently became “a
member of President Donald Trump’s cabinet” and currently serves as the Secretary of Labor.
Id. Since the Miami Herald published its expose, some members of Congress have demanded an
investigation into what led to the slap-on-the-wrist punishment for Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,
Anthony Man, Florida Democrats want investigation into Trump cabinet member’s role in

handling Epstein case, SOUTH FLORIDA SUN SENTINEL (Dec. 4, 2018) available at

4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016494
"
IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030985.txt,"The fact that Acosta didn’t is another sign — if one were needed — that this was a
capitulation. It also casts further doubt on the claim that Acosta was capitulating for the
purpose of sparing the folks who worked with him in the prosecutor’s office.

The key point, though, is that Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz were power players in
Washington — men who might help Acosta down the road.

Readers will be quite familiar with Starr’s background. Lefkowitz was director of cabinet
affairs and deputy executive secretary to the domestic policy council under President George
H.W. Bush. Under President George W. Bush, Lefkowitz served as general counsel in the
Office of Management and Budget and later as deputy director of domestic policy at the
White House.

Accommodating such influential figures must have seemed like a good career move. Having
Starr and Lefkowitz on his side might help Acosta get a judgeship, a cabinet appointment, or
a high-paying job back at Kirkland and Ellis.

I’m speculating, of course. But my speculation finds support in Acosta’s practice of
accommodating the powerful.

Much of that accommodation is of Democrats. Indeed, at the time Acosta was working in
Miami as a U.S. Attorney, he had alienated some Republicans by such accommodation
while at the Department of Justice. Some say he was on the verge of being fired when
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez parachuted him to Miami. The Epstein settlement was a
way for Acosta to shore up his standing with some influential Republicans.

Will Acosta be able to survive the current scandal? I don’t have a clear sense about this yet.
But President Trump, who isn’t bashful about sacking cabinet members, may come to
believe (if he doesn’t now) that it’s disadvantageous to have a cabinet member who sold out
teenage victims of sexual abuse, especially when the sell-out benefited an ultra-wealthy
serial offender.

* Some on the left are trying to make something or the fact that Starr, who had investigated
Bill Clinton in connection with sexual misconduct, later defended Epstein, a pervert. This is
silly.

In both instances, Starr was doing his job as a lawyer. Perverts are entitled to a defense and
there is nothing hypocritical about investigating Bill Clinton’s misconduct when that was
Starr’s job and later joining the team that was defending Jeffrey Epstein.

Acosta, by contrast, was on the team seeking justice for Epstein and for his victims. He gave
up this quest for reasons that can’t be defended.

patrol along the canal, I would sometimes see the hulk of an Israeli tank which
had been destroyed by Soviet-made AT-3s. Known as Saggers, they were
portable, allowing a single soldier to fire wire-guided missiles. Their range was
nearly a mile-and-a-half, which was more than the main guns on our tanks. Yet
no one appeared to have addressed the question of what would happen if the
Egyptians used Saggers on an even greater scale in a future war.

I remained in the Sinai through early 1971, but never led my tank company
on combat operations. By the time we were due for our deployment, the War of
Attrition was suddenly over. Neither we nor the Egyptians wanted a return to
full-scale war. With Washington taking the lead, a cease-fire was agreed. Both
sides claimed victory. But both were exhausted. Certainly, most Israelis had
ceased to see a compelling reason for the 1,000 days of fighting. We had lost
about 900 dead: more than in the Six-Day War.

But in one respect, the Egyptians won. Under the terms of the truce, their
anti-aircraft batteries were barred from a roughly 30-mile strip along the canal.
Within days of the truce, however, Nasser began moving his SAM batteries
forward. Before long, there were nearly 100 missile sites in the “prohibited”
zone, giving the Egyptians control of 20 miles or more of the airspace on our
side of the canal. Golda was incensed. So was Bar-Lev. But there was no way,
and no will, to reopen the fighting and force Nasser to move the missiles back.

The cease-fire took effect at midnight on August 7, 1970. I’ve never had
trouble recalling the date, because of a phone call almost exactly 24 hours later.
It was from my mother-in-law, to tell me Nava had gone into labor with our first
child. Since I was due for deployment on the front line, we had agreed weeks
earlier that the best thing would be for her to have the baby in Tiberias, so her
parents could be with her. Now, I got a Jeep and raced north. I reached Tiberias
the next morning. I opened the door to the hospital room and saw Nava,
obviously tired but beaming, cradling our daughter Michal in her arms.

I managed to stay with them for several days before returning to the Sinai.
With Nava and Michal soon settled back into our apartment in the north Tel
Aviv neighborhood of Ramat Aviv, I made weekend visits home whenever I
could. Still, I saw nowhere near as much of our daughter’s first few months as
most fathers. As Nava and I would discover even more jarringly over the next
few years, that was an inescapable part of being an army officer.

INSIGHT

Power with purpose

Robert Lawrence Kuhn explains why abolishing presidential term limits may well be good for China

o interview delegates

and officials at the

annual National Peo-

ple’s Congress in Bei-

jing, interspersed with
being interviewed in the interna-
tional media about China abol-
ishing term limits forits president,
is to inhabit parallel universes.

Delegates and officials focus
on clusters of issues from control-
ling financial risk and reducing
pollution to scientific innovation
and business stimulation, plus
enhancing and institutionalising
China’s anti-corruption cam-
paign with a powerful National
Supervision Commission. The
international media, no surprise,
focus on the constitutional
amendment ending term limits,
assuming President XiJinping will
now serve in a for-life dictator-
ship, reminiscent of Mao's China,
the Soviet Union, the Kim family
in North Korea and some African
countries.

It is no challenge to explain
why abolishing term limits is bad
for China - dependency on one
human being who is not omni-
scient but is hostage to fortune,
fewer and weaker checks and
balances, forced conformity in a
complex society with no easy an-
swers, etc. The system begins
stronger in that hard choices can
be made and consistency main-
tained, butit could become brittle
in that officials are more wary and
may say things they do not
believe.

Itisa challenge to explain why
abolishing term limits is good for
China, so that's what! will do.

First, some background. There
are three separate issues being
conflated: the significance of end-
ing term limits, the intended con-
sequences and the unintended
consequences. Though terminat-
ing the two-term limit for China's
presidency captures headlines, it
is more the symbolic, final step
ratifying Xi’s near-absolute power
than the big breakthrough itself.

Many expect this
experiment to
end badly for
China. It is
indeed an
experiment but
its end is not set

Xi’s prior designation as “core” of
the Communist Party in October
2016 and the inscribing of “Xi
Jinping Thought...” into the party
constitution in October 2017 were
more meaningful.

Moreover, the Politburo
Standing Committee, the highest
authoritative body in China,
unambiguously supports Xi.
China watchers see the front page
of People's Daily - published the
day after the new Standing Com-
mittee marched out on stage —
which featured Xi’s photo on top,
many times larger than the small-
er, subservient photo of all seven
members lined up on the bottom.

All this reconfirms that, in a
system where the party controls
the state - especially where the
pany ‘is Marxist and ideology is its

asis for being — Xi, as core of the
party, with his name inscribed in
the constitutions of party and
state as the contemporary arbiter
of Marxism, will be the uncontest-
ed, overarching leader of China
for the rest of his sentient life.

For intended consequences,
the official line is that the purpose
is national cohesion brought
about when the three top leader-
ship positions — general secretary
ofthe party, chairman of the Cen-
tral Military Commission and
president of the republic - are
aligned temporally and held bya
single person.

his makes sense, but as a
primary, proximal motivation, itis
not entirely persuasive. The
current structure has existed for
decades without outcry or angst
(notto mention that the three po-
sitions could be unified by install-
ing term limits on the other two).

The “newera”, marked by eco-
nomic, social and global com-
plexities, is said to require firm
and consistent leadership, mak-
ing moot inner party struggles
and even mitigating political gos-
sip, facilitating focus on the tasks
of governance and development.
Specifically, because advancing

etd)

reformhasbecome more difficult,
with entrenched interest groups
resisting change, the message
must now go forth that all must
get with the programme, because
you can’t outwit or outwait Xi.

Because, it is said that only Xi
has the vision, experience, com-
petence and character to bring
about “the great rejuvenation of
the Chinese people”, especially
from 2020 to 2035 and ultimately
to 2050- bringing China to global
centre stage — Xi’s unimpeded
leadership is deemed essential.
China cannot afford “downtime”
to accommodate a change of
leadership, and after Xi’s success
at the 19th National Party Con-
gress came the time to make clear
that he will call the shots for the
foreseeable future.

Some argue that doing away
with term limits shows the superi-
ority of the Chinese system as it
allows flexibility in matching
leadership to requirements
(though what national leader,
when extending his reach, hasnot
claimed “current requirements”
as justification?)

The party-run Global Times
stated that ending term limits
does notmean China has reverted
to president-for-life tenure. (But
who can deny that however long
Xi holds the top positions seems
largely up to him?)

As for the unintended conse-
quences, the almost unanimous,
disparaging foreign reaction —
other than US President Donald
Trump’s-didnotburnish China's
international image.

More worrisome would be a
reluctance by officials to offer
constructive opposing views on
central policies.

By stressing term limits, the
international media misses
fundamental changes going on in
China ~ this ee, innovation,
streamlining of government, faci-
litation of business (cutting
bureaucracy and reducing taxes),
rural revitalisation and rural land

reform. The 13th National Peo-
ple’s Congress shows how the
grand vision and mission of the
19th National Party Congress is
translated into specific strategies
and policies. Ifone sees only term
limits, one cannotvisualise thebig
picture.

AsforXimaintaining the presi-
dency perpetually, it doesn’tactu-
ally matter much thisis the deep
insight of how China’s party-state
system works. Xi as core of the
party and “Xi Jinping Thought...”
as the party's (andnowthestate’s)
guiding principle means that Xi
can transfer titular party leader-
shipand/orthe presidencyto oth-
ers and still maintain his
overarching power. It may well be
that, after serving two or even
three more terms, rather than try-
ing to find and install another
leaderlike himself, he will move to
bring about true democracy with-
inthe I.

Here's he best case. Xi will not
be leader-for-life, but leader long
enough to bring about China's
national rejuvenation and estab-
lish a Chinese kind of democratic
norms. Could Xi continue until
around 2035, when China plans to
have “basically” achieved full mo-
dernisation, heading towards, by
mid-century, 2050, a “great mod-
ern socialist country”?

Many expect this experiment
toend badly for China. Itis indeed
an experiment but its end is not
set. It may be a race between
achieving Xi’s grand vision and
some untoward perturbation that
could cause fracture.

Allfactors considered, Iam not
saying abolishing term limits is
absolutely good for China. I am
saying itmay be good -because of
China's special conditions and
Xi’s special capabilities—butifitis
good, it’s just for this once, andit’s
just for so long. That's the best
case. I'm rooting forXi.

What the Western belt and road sceptics are missing

Wenshan Jia says there are opportunities for the whole world to benefit from China’s initiative

hina'’s “Belt and Road Initiative’is

an original plan to carry out anew

type of “collaborative globalisation”
above and beyond US-led type. Itwas
proposed five years ago by President Xi
Jinping after the tapering off of US-led
globalisation in 2008.

Xioffered three principles: mutual
consultation, joint construction and
shared benefits. China has since then fully
executed 101 agreements with 86
countries, and total investmentin the 24
countries along the belt and road regions.
has amounted to US$50 billion, resulting
in 75 industrial and trade zones, an¢
200,000 jobs.

With its focus on infrastructure, the
initiative is a model not only for developing
countries, but also industrialised ones in
Europe and North America, where ageing
infrastructure needs replacing. It also
adapts to each local, national or regional
condition, situation and need. Itis proving
very democratic, more so than the
lopsided US-led globalisation that spurred
a populist, isolationist backlash across the
Western world.

China has done a proper job of
explaining to the West what the initiative is
and extended a sincere invitation to each

country to join. Many think tank scholars.
and major media outlets in the West have
found it potentially lucrative and
expressed relatively strong support.

Yet, instead of appreciating China's
efforts to both inherit the liberal agenda of
globalisation and forgea new path for
global development, many Western
political elite, led by the US, have started a
campaign to resist the initiative. From
Australia to the US, and the UK to
Germany, there are calls for the West to cut
interactions with China to minimise or
resist its so-called “sharp power”. The
labels typically applied to China include
“authoritarian” and ‘predatory citing
Beijing for not upholding “freedom,
democracy and individual rights”, the core
values of the West.

This attitude towards the initiative
reveals not only a contradiction in the
Western mind, but also the narrowing or
even closing of minds.

Isn'tit beneficial to meet the goals of
forging connectivity and cooperation, as
articulated in Xi’s effort to enrich and
expand the meaning of the “free world” by
liberating humankind from geographical,
financial, political and cultural barriers?
The worldis no longer the West versus the

rest, as wealready live in aworld
connected by the internet. The initiative
seeks to make the world more
interconnected for both the West and the
rest, contributing to the construction ofa
human community with a shared future.

Recently, the initiative has inspired and
spawned a push for localisation,
particularly the Indo-Pacific strategy led by
the so-called “Quad” of the US, India,
Japan and Australia. Some Western media
viewit asa rival or alternative to China’s
beltand road.

But] would argue that it can be part of
China's initiative as longas the three
Chinese principles (mutual consultation,

The anti-China smear
campaign must be
replaced bya
discourse involving
consultation and
communication

joint construction and shared benefits) are
observed in the Quad strategy. The belt
and road was created to be anall-inclusive
platform, so Beijing has no need to fear
localisation as long as such strategies do
not seek to contain China or disruptits
plan. Itwould be wise for the Quad and
China to look for ways to collaborate.

Quad countries need not take an
antagonistic stance towards China; the
anti-China smear campaign must be
replaced bya discourse involving
consultation and communication. The
world has experienced more than enough
damaging talk, not to mention wars.

The core principles of Xi’s belt and road
strategy must be always applied in China's
interactions with local strategies. If China
is, as German Foreign Minister Sigmar
Gabriel told the Munich Security
Conference in February, “the only country
in the world with any sort of genuinely
global, geostrategic concept”, then
Western leaders should cultivate a
genuinely global strategy in line with
China's vision, for the betterment of all
humankind.

Private clubs
deserve ‘cushy’
rental deals

Edith Terry says private recreational
clubs are part of Hong Kong’s
heritage and have contributed to
nurturing less popular sports, as
well as a unique hybrid culture

first job, went in search of a social group. He founda
home away from home in Hong Kong's oldest
private recreational club, newly relocated froma prime
location on Victoria Harbour, where City Hall is today,
toa modest flagstone boathouse beneath Island Road
on Hong Kong's south side. Fifty-five years later, Frank
Pfeiffer, a Zen Buddhist and mountain climber, is still
anactive member of the Victoria Recreation Club,
established in 1849. He has watched it ring the changes
from Hong Kong's colonial society in the 1960s, when it
had only two Chinese members and no female
members, to the hybrid institution it is today, under its
first Hong Kong Chinese chairman, Wu Kam Shing.

Its membership is a spectrum of Hong Kong's
diverse and athletically minded middle class. There is
the Hong Kong Chinese court reporter who visits the
club in Deep Water Bay every morning at 6am on her
way from home in Ap Lei Chau to her workplace in Sha
Tin. There are her fellow swimmers, many elderly, who
swim outto the buoys, rain or shine, hot or cold, eve
day. Some 100-150 “paddlers” use the club as a base for
outrigger canoeing, dragon boating and paddle
boarding. Some of the sports were unknown to Hong
Kong before the club nurtured them, others, like
dragon boating, are deeply traditional.

In the current debate over the future of the 67
private recreational clubs that pay minimal rents to the
government, history has been swept aside. True, they
were designed on a colonial template, in which the
diverse ethnic groups were given separate retreats.
Membership at the pinnacle clubs was reserved
primarily for the British. For other ethnic groups, there
was a Chinese Recreation Club, a Club de Recreio, a
Hlipiie Club, an Indian Recreation Club, andso on.

long Kong's colonial rulers reviewed the lease
system for the private clubs in 1968 and 1979, andin
the run-up to the handover in 1997 when leases were
restricted to 15-year terms. At the handover, anumber
of leases were extended to ensure a so-called smooth
transition. The sceptic would argue that this was a
dodge, and indeed in 2011, during the first post-1997
review of private recreational leases oy the Legislative
Council, most of the clubs seemed oblivious to public
concerns as well as new requirements for “opening up”

The government argued
that subsidies were
needed because use of land
for sports and recreation
would never trump
commercial utilisation

I 1964, ayoung German, fresh off the plane athis

to schools and community organisations, Following
the last well-publicised review in 2013 and the current
investigation seeking new venues for public housing,
theyareno longer complacent.

Should the private clubs have got their cushy rental
deals in the first place? At the time of the reviews 50
years ago, the government argued that subsidies were
needed because use ofland for sports and recreation
would never trump commercial utilisation. What was
true then is even more so today. The high cost ofland in
Hong Kongis dragon innovation and creativity. The
existence of the private recreational clubs means ithas
been less ofa dragon sports.

Most of the clubs with governmentleases are
framed around core sports golf, tennis, horse racing,
swimming sailing and rowing, to namea few. Hong
Kong athletes whose development was: supported by
these clubs have gone to the Olympics and other
international competitions. In the 1940s, the Victoria
Recreation Club was the driving force behind Hong,
Kong's participation in the International Olympic
Committee and the Hong Kong Sports Federation.

Public pressure on the clubs to forge community
ties and contribute to Hong Kong through “opening
up” schemes is appropriate—but not the pressure to
convert their land to high-rise estates. The loss is not
only to the core sports they represent but also to their
unique DNA, which is the foundation of Hong Kong—
diverse, cosmopolitan and adventurous. If you want to
look for a Hong Kong that is not just about money, one
place tolookishere.

Recreation Club. She writes in a personal capacity

E. Victims Refuse Silence

44. _ Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Roberts concluded
that she should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who had
also suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse, and of possibly protecting future potential
victims.

45. On December 23, 2014, Roberts incorporated an organization called Victims
Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation.

46. Roberts intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against
sexual abuse and human trafficking. The goal of her organization was, and continues to be, to
help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of
sexual abuse, and to help others to escape becoming victims of sex trafficking.

47. Dershowitz made his false and defamatory statements as set forth above on behalf
of himself and on behalf of his co-conspirator and client Epstein, in the Southern District of New
York and elsewhere, in a deliberate effort to maliciously discredit Roberts and silence her efforts
to expose the sexual abuse she suffered. Dershowitz and Epstein did so with the purpose and
effect of having others repeat such false and defamatory statements and thereby further
damaged Roberts’s reputation. Dershowitz and Epstein knew Dershowitz’s statements were

false.

AFFIRMATION OF JOHN M.
BROWNING IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO UNSEAL
On Appeal from New York Supreme Court,
New York County, Index No. 30129/10
(Pickholz, J.)
John M. Browning, an attorney duly admitted to practice before the Courts of the State of
New York, affirms the following under penalties of perjury:
1. I am an associate of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, attorneys for non-party movant
NYP Holdings, Inc., publisher of the New York Post (the Post) and I submit this affirmation in
support of the Post's motion to unseal the briefs filed by the parties in the above-captioned
appeal.
2. The grounds for unsealing the appeal briefs in this action are set forth in the
accompanying memorandum of law. I submit this affirmation to annex relevant documents and
to state facts that are relevant to this motion, of which I have personal knowledge.
3. Annexed hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of an article written by
Julie K. Brown and published by the Miami Herald on November 28, 2018, entitled Cops
worked to put serial sex abuser in prison. Prosecutors worked to cut him a break.
4. Annexed hereto as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of an article written by
Rebecca Rosenberg and Danika Fears, which was published by the Post on January 7, 2015,
entitled DA's office 'went easy' on sex offender Epstein.
4840-5788-8644v. I 3930033-000039
5. Annexed hereto as Exhibit C is a true and correct copy of an article written by
Rebecca Rosenberg, Larry Celona, Susan Edelman and Isabel Vincent, which was published by
the Post on December 1, 2018, entitled Manhattan DA sided with pedophile billionaire after
botching investigation.
6. On or about December 4, 2018, Post reporter Susan Edelman contacted Danny
Frost, Director of Communications for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., and
requested copies of the briefs filed by the District Attorney's office in the above-captioned
appeal. Ms. Edelman stated that names of victims could be redacted before the briefs were
disclosed.
7. Mr. Frost responded that he could not provide Ms. Edelman with copies of the
briefs because they were filed under seal pursuant to N.Y. Civil Rights Law 50-b and that the
District Attorney's office could only release the briefs, even with victims' names redacted, if this
Court ordered the briefs to be unsealed.
8. Mr. Frost further indicated by email that [i]f the Post petitions the court, and the
court asks the People for our position, we will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief'
(emphasis in original). A true and correct copy of that email correspondence is annexed hereto
as Exhibit D.
9. On or about December 18, 2018, I contacted Jay Lefkowitz, who represented
appellant Jeffi-ey Epstein in the above-captioned appeal. Mr. Lefkowitz told me that he no
longer represents Mr. Epstein and referred me to Martin Weinberg, who currently acts as counsel
for Mr. Epstein.
I 0.
On or about December 20, 2018, I spoke with Mr. Weinberg and explained the
nature of the Post's motion to unseal the redacted briefs and the position taken by the Manhattan
4840-5788-8644v. I 3930033-000039
District Attorney. Mr. Weinberg told me that he was unable to take a position on the Post's
motion without first reviewing it and reserved the right to file an opposition, if necessary.
11. On December 21, 2018, the Post filed a motion requesting an order unsealing the
appellate briefs and directing the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to produce copies with
the names of victims redacted (the December 21 Motion).
12. On or about December 28, 2018, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office filed an
affirmation in response to the Post's motion, signed by Assistant District Attorney Karen
Friedman Agnifilo and dated December 28, 2018 (the DA Affirmation). A true and correct
copy of the Affirmation is annexed hereto as Exhibit E.
13. On January 2, 2019, I spoke with Ms. Friedman Agnifilo to discuss the DA
Affirmation. Ms. Friedman Agnifilo told me that there had been a miscommunication by Mr.
Frost and that the District Attorney's Office did oppose the December 21 Motion. Ms. Friedman
Agnifilo also told me that, in the view of the District Attorney's Office, the Post should give
notice of their motion to unseal the appeal briefs to the prosecutors in Florida that handled the
prosecution that led to Mr. Epstein's conviction for solicitation of prostitution from a minor. The
Post disagrees with that position but nevertheless decided to moot any procedural issues related
to requirements to notify the Florida prosecutors. Ms. Friedman Agnifilo subsequently informed
me that the agency in Florida responsible for Mr. Epstein's prosecution was the Palm Beach
County State Attorney's Office.
14. On January 3, 2019, I received an email from Mr. Weinberg stating that after
consideration of your request for the unsealing of the appellate briefs with redactions of certain
identities, we take no position on behalf of Mr. Epstein. A true and correct copy of that email is
annexed hereto as Exhibit F.
4840-5788-8644v. l 3930033-000039
15. On January 4, 2019, the Post filed a letter with this Court voluntarily withdrawing
the December 21 Motion without prejudice to refile in order to moot the procedural issues raised
by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office with respect to furnishing notice to prosecutors in
Florida. A true and correct copy of that letter is annexed as Exhibit G.
16. On or about January 10, 2019, I contacted the Palm Beach County State
Attorney's Office to inform it of the Post's intention to file a motion to unseal the appellate
briefs and to inquire about where to send a copy of the motion. A member of the Office of State
Attorney David Aronberg instructed me to send a digital copy of the motion to e­
postconviction@sa15.org and to send a paper copy to the State Attorney's main offices.
17. On or about January 10 and January 11, 2019, I spoke with Sarah J. Schall,
Special Counsel to the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Florida, to inform her Office of
the Post's intention to file a motion to unseal the appellate briefs and to inquire about where to
send a copy of the motion. Ms. Schall instructed me to send a digital copy of the motion papers
to her email address and to forward hard copies to Dexter Lee.

PERVERSION
of JUSTICE
A decade before #Me Too, a multimillionaire sex offender from Florida got the ultimate
break.
Palm Beach, Florida
November 2004
Jane Doe
Michelle Licata climbed a narrow, winding staircase, past walls covered with
photographs of naked girls. At the top of the stairwell was a vast master bed and
bath, with cream-colored shag carpeting and a hot pink and mint green sofa.
The room was dimly lit and very cold.
There was a vanity, a massage table and a timer.
A silver-haired man wearing nothing but a white towel came into the room. He
lay facedown on a massage table, and while talking on a phone, directed Licata to
rub his back, legs and feet.
Micelle Licata, is one of the over 100 middle school and high school-aged girls that Palm Beach billionaire, Jeffrey
Epstein, is accused of sexually assaulting. Licata, now an adult living near Nashville, recalls her experience with
Epstein at his Palm Beach mansion while she was a sophomore at Royal Palm Beach High School.
EMILY MICHOT EMICHOT@MIAMIHERALD.COM
After he hung up, the man turned over and dropped his towel, exposing himself.
He told Licata to get comfortable and then, in a firm voice, told her to take off
her clothes.
At 16, Licata had never before been fully naked in front of anyone. Shaking and
panicked, she mechanically pulled off her jeans and stripped down to her
underwear. He set the timer for 30 minutes and then reached over and
unsnapped her bra. He then began touching her with one hand and masturbating
himself with the other.
I kept looking at the timer because I didn't want to have this mental image of
what he was doing, she remembered of the massage. He kept trying to put his
fingers inside me and told me to pinch his nipples. He was mostly saying 'just do
that, harder, harder and do this .... ' 
After he ejaculated, he stood up and walked to the shower, dismissing her as if
she had been in history class.
It wasn't long before a lot of Licata's fellow students at Royal Palm Beach High
School had heard about a creepy old guy named Jeffrey who lived in a pink
waterfront mansion and was paying girls $200 to $300 to give him massages that
quickly turned sexual.
Eventually, the Palm Beach police, and then the FBI, came knocking on Licata's
door. In the police report, Licata was referred to as a Jane Doe in order to protect
her identity as a minor.
Palm Beach home of registered sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.
PEDRO PORTAL PPORTAL@MIAMIHERALD.COM
There would be many Jane Does to follow: Jane Doe No. 3, Jane Doe No. 4, Jane
Does 5, 6, 7, 8 - and as the years went by- Jane Does 102 and 103.
Long before #MeToo became the catalyst for a women's movement about sexual
assault - and a decade before the fall of Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and U.S.
Olympic gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar - there was Jeffrey Edward Epstein.
Epstein, a multimillionaire hedge fund manager whose friends included a
constellation of entertainers, politicians, business titans and royalty, for years
lured teenag�girls to his Palm Beach mansion as P-art of a cult-like sex P-Y-ramid
scheme, police in the town of Palm Beach found.
The girls arrived, sometimes by taxi, for trysts at all hours of the day and night.
Few were told much more than that they would be paid to give an old man a
massage - and that he might ask them to strip down to their underwear or get
naked. But what began as a massage often led to masturbation, oral sex,
intercourse and other sex acts, police and court records show. The alleged abuse
dates back to 2001 and went on for years.
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing dozens of underage girls
according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never had a voice, until now.
BY EMILY MICHOT ill I JULIE K. BROWN ill
In 2007, despite ample physical evidence and multiple witnesses corroborating
the girls' stories, federal prosecutors and Epstein's lawyers quietly put together a
remarkable deal for Epstein, then 54. He agreed to plead guilty to two felony
prostitution charges in state court, and in exchange, he and his accomplices
received immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him
to prison for life.
He served 13 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach County stockade. His
.alkged co-consP-irators, who helped schedule his sex sessions, were never
prosecuted.
The deal, called a federal non-prosecution agreement, was sealed so that no one
- not even his victims - could know the full scope of Epstein's crimes and who
else was involved. The U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta,-™..P-ersonall y:
involved in the negotiations, records, letters and emails show.
Acosta is now a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. As U.S. secretary
of labor, he has oversight over international child labor laws and human
trafficking and had recently been mentioned as a possible successor to farmer
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who resigned under pressure in early
November. It was reported on Thursday, a day after this story posted online, that
he was no longer in the running.

The Miami Herald anal y: zed thousands of P-ages of court records and lawsuits,
witness depositions and newly released FBI documents, and also identified more
than 80 women who say they were victimized. They are scattered around the
country and abroad. Until now, those victims - today in their late 20s and early
30s - have never spoken publicly about how they felt shamed, silenced and
betrayed by the very people in the criminal justice system who were supposed to
hold Epstein accountable.
How come people who don't have money get sent to jail - and can't even make
bail - and they have to do their time and sit there and think about what they did
wrong? He had no repercussions and doesn't even believe he did anything
wrong, said Licata, now 30.

Licata is among 36 women who were officially identified by the FBI and the U.S.
Attorney's Office as victims of Epstein, now 65. But after the FBI case was closed
in 2008, witnesses and alleged victims testified in civil court that there were
hundreds of girls who were brought to Epstein's homes, including girls from
Europe, Latin America and former Soviet Republic countries.
But Acosta and Epstein's armada of attorneys - Harvard professor Alan
Dershowitz, Jay Lefkowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Jack Goldberger, Roy Black, Guy
Lewis and former Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr - reached a
consensus: Epstein would never serve time in a federal or state prison.

Sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein was surrounded by powerful people. Here's a sampling
NOVEMBER 28, 2018 8:00 AM
------------- ----·----
---·--·- --· ----------·-----
POLICE UNDER PRESSURE
There were really just two people willing to risk their careers to go after Epstein:
Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter and Detective Joseph Recarey.
For Reiter, business tycoon Jeffrey Epstein wasn't any more formidable than any
of the other 8,000 or so wealthy and powerful people living on the island. Police
had handled sensational cases involving wealthy residents before - from the
murders of heiresses to the rape case involving William Kennedy Smith, of the
Kennedy family.
The easternmost town in Florida, Palm Beach is a 10.4-square-mile barrier island
between the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean populated by some of
the richest people in the country. President Trump has his winter White House
in Palm Beach, and the town makes news as much for its glitz as it does for its
unusual efforts to preserve its well-mannered image, like banning shirtless
Joggers.
But it was a little surprising, even to Reiter, to learn that one of its residents had a
revolving door of middle and high school girls coming to his gated compound
throughout the day and night.
In their first on-the-record media interviews about the case, Reiter and Recarey
revealed new details about the investigation, and how they were, in their view,
pressured by then-Palm Beach State Attorney Barry Krischer to downgrade the
case to a misdemeanor or drop it altogether.
Former Palm Beach County Police Detective Joe Recarey was the lead detective on the solicitation-of-minors case
against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
EMILY MICHOT EMICHOT@MIAMIHERALD.COM
Between March of 2005 -when the case was opened -and seven months later,
when police executed a search warrant at Epstein's home, Recarey had identified
21 possible victims, according to a copy of the unredacted police report obtained
by the Herald. By the time police felt they had enough evidence to arrest Epstein
on sex charges, they had identified about 3 5 possible underage victims and were
tracking down at least a dozen more, the police report said.
I was surprised at how quickly it snowballed. I thought at some point there
would be a last interview, but the next victim would supply me with three or four
more names and the next one had three or four names and it just kept getting
bigger and bigger,'' Recarey said.
By then, word had gotten back to Epstein from some of the girls that they had
been questioned by police. Epstein hired famed lawyer Alan Dershowitz.
Alan Dershowitz flew down and met privately with Krischer, Recarey said. And
the shenanigans that happened, I don't think I've ever seen or heard of before.
Police reports show that Epstein's private investigators attempted to conduct
interviews while posing as cops; that they picked through Reiter's trash in search
of dirt to discredit him; and that the private investigators were accused of
following the girls and their families. In one case, the father of one girl claimed
he had been run off the road by a private investigator, police and court reports
show.

The Miami Herald obtained thousands of FBI and court records, lawsuits, and witness depositions, and went to
federal court in New York to access sealed documents in the reporting of Perversion of Justice. The Herald
also tracked down more than 60 women who said they were victims, some of whom had never spoken of the
abuse before.

Several of the girls said they felt intimidated and frightened by Epstein and Sarah
Kellen, the millionaire's assistant and alleged scheduler of massages, who warned
them not to talk to police, according to the police report.
Dershowitz, in an interview with the Herald, said he had nothing to do with
gathering background on the girls - or in directing anyone to follow the police, or
the girls and their families.
I'm not an investigator. My only job was to negotiate and try the case when it
comes to trial,'' he said.
He nevertheless convinced Krischer that the girls would not be credible on the
witness stand, according to Reiter and Recarey.
The defense team's investigators compiled dossiers on the victims in an effort to
show that Epstein's accusers had troubled pasts.
Dershowitz met with Krischer and Recarey, sharing with them the results of an
investigation into one of the girls, described by Dershowitz as an accomplished
drama student who hurled profanities at his investigator at a furious pace.
10/27/99 - OPINION - Barry Krischer; P.B.Co. State Attorney. (AM)
Our investigation had discovered at least one of her websites and I am enclosing
some examples ... the site goes on to detail, including photos, her apparent
fascination with marijuana,  Dershowitz wrote in an undated letter to Recarey.
He also disputed the claim that one of the defense team's private investigators
had misrepresented himself as a police officer.
Recarey stood his ground.
His attorneys showed us a MySpace page where one of the-girls was holding a
beer in her hand, and they said, 'oh look, she is underage drinking,'  Recarey
recalled. Well, tell me what teenager doesn't? Does that mean she isn't a victim
because she drank a beer? Basically, what you're telling me is the only victim of a
sexual battery could be a nun.
Krischer and the lead state prosecutor on the case, Assistant State Attorney Lanna
Belohlavek, began to dodge Recarey and Reiter's phone calls and emails, and they
dragged their feet on approving subpoenas, Reiter and Recarey said.
Early on, it became clear that things had changed, from Krischer saying, 'we'll
put this guy away for life,' to 'these are all the reasons why we aren't going to
prosecute this,'  Reiter said.
Krischer, who is now retired and in private practice, did not respond to multiple
requests from the Herald for comment. Belohlavek also did not respond to an
email sent to her office.
It became apparent to me that some of our evidence was being leaked to
Epstein's lawyers, who began to question everything that we had in our probable
cause affidavit, Reiter said.
The day of the search on Oct. 20, 2005, they found that most of Epstein's
computer hard drives, surveillance cameras and videos had been removed from
the house, leaving loose, dangling wires, according to the police report.
But the girls' description of the house squared with what detectives found, right
down to the hot pink couch and the dresser drawer of sex toys in Epstein's
bathroom.
Reiter said his own trash was disappearing from his house, as his life was put
under Epstein's microscope. Private investigators hired by Epstein's lawyers even
tracked down Reiter's grade school teachers, the former chief said. Questions
were raised about donations that Epstein had made to the police department,
even though Reiter had returned one of the donations shortly after the
investigation began.
Recarey, meanwhile, said he began to take different routes to and from work, and
even switched vehicles because he knew he was being tailed.
At some point it became like a cat-and-mouse game. I would stop at a red light
and go. I knew they were there, and they knew I knew they were there. I was
concerned about my kids because I didn't know if it was someone that they hired
just out of prison that would hurt me or my family, Recarey said.
Despite relentless political pressure, Reiter and Recarey soldiered on, and their
determination yielded evidence that supported most of the girls' allegations, the
former cops said. They had phone records that showed Epstein and his assistant,
Kellen, had called many of the girls. Epstein's flight logs showed that the calls
were made when Epstein was in Palm Beach.
They obtained dozens of message pads from his home that read like a who's who
of famous people, including magician David Copperfield and Donald Trump, an
indication of Epstein's vast circle of influential friends. There were also messages
from girls, and their phone numbers matched those of many of the girls Recarey
had interviewed, Recarey said. They read: Courtney called, she can come at 4,
or Tanya can't come at 7 p.m. tomorrow because she has soccer practice.
They also found naked photographs of underage girls in Epstein's closet, Recarey
said.
There were also witnesses: Two of Epstein's butlers gave Recarey sworn
interviews, confirming that young girls had been coming and going at the house.
One of the butlers, Alfredo Rodri gu ez, told Recarey that when he was tasked with
cleaning up the master bath after Epstein's sessions with the girls, he often
discovered sex toys. Once, he accidentally stumbled on a high school girl, whom
he identified, sleeping naked in Epstein's spa, he testified in a 2009 court
deposition.
Rodriguez said he was given the job of paying the girls, telling Recarey that he
was a human ATM machine because he was ordered by Epstein to keep $2,000
on him at all times. He was also assigned to buy the girls gifts. Rodri gu ez gave
Recarey copies of pages from a book that Epstein and his staff kept with the
names and phone numbers for many of the Palm Beach County girls, Recarey
said.
Rodriguez, however, held onto the bulk of Epstein's little black book, and in
November 2009 tried to sell it for $50,000 to an undercover FBI agent posing as
a victim's lawyer. He was arrested and sentenced in 2012 to federal prison, and
died three years later following an illness. The book - listing personal phone
numbers for a cavalcade of Epstein's powerful friends and celebrities - eventually
became public as part of a civil lawsuit. It listed more than 100 female names
and phone numbers under the headings massage in every city where Epstein
had homes.
In May 2006, Recarey drew up probable cause affidavits, charging Epstein, two of
his assistants and one recruiter with sex-related crimes. Instead, Krischer took
what Recarey said was the unusual step of referring the case to a state grand jury.
Epstein was indicted in state court on a minor charge of solicitation of
prostitution.
Recarey said Krischer told him he didn't believe Epstein's accusers, and only two
of them were called before the state grand jury investigating the case - even
though police had lined up more than a dozen girls and witnesses at that time.
Believing that the case had been tainted, Reiter - that same month, May 2006 -
took a very public stance against Krischer, writing a letter, which was released to
the news media, calling on Krischer to remove himself from the case. The chief
then referred it to the FBI, which opened its own investigation in July 2006, FBI
records show.
Reiter said he was effectively blackballed in some Palm Beach circles as a result
of going over Krischer's head, and their relationship, once strong, would never be
the same.
Reiter has no regrets about what he did.
There are challenges here that don't exist in a lot of other places because of the
affluence in the community, but the only way I could approach this case was that
none of that matters. The truth is still the truth. The facts are the facts.
Everybody is treated the same.
In the years that followed, several of the victims obtained lawyers and filed civil
lawsuits against Epstein. About two dozen lawsuits were filed, starting in 2008.
The early cases were particularly brutal for his victims, the court records show.
The girls faced fierce grilling from another pack of Epstein's civil attorneys, who
questioned them about their boyfriends, drinking, drug use, social media posts,
their parents and even their medical histories.
One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and
knew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.
Licata said the questions from Epstein's civil lawyers were so intimate that she
became paranoid that people were following her.
His lawyers were just in my life inside and out. They asked if I had a baby, if I
had an abortion, 'did you sleep with 30 different guys' and 'do you think that
played a part?' I said, 'you're going to come at me like that when you represent a
guy who is doing this to hundreds of girls? How do you sleep at night?' 
BROOKLYN TO PALM BEACH
Jeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, the son of a New York parks department
worker. In one of several depositions he gave as part of the lawsuits filed against
him, he said he attended the Cooper Union school for the advancement of
science and art and then studied physics at New York University. But he never
obtained a degree, instead going on to teach at the Dalton School, an elite K-12
private academy on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Various news profiles over the
years have speculated about how he made his vast fortune, calling him an
International Moneyman of Mystery and The Talented Mr. Epstein.
He then struck out on his own, opening J. Epstein & Co. His fortunes improved
when he became a financial advisor for Leslie Wexner, founder of The Limited
stores and owner of Victoria's Secret brands. Later, Epstein would boast that he
would manage the portfolios of only those clients who had $1 billion or
more. This much is known: He got his start on Wall Street after being offered a
job by the father of one of his students. At Bear Steams, he became a derivative
specialist, applying complex math formulas and computer algorithms to evaluate
financial data and trends.
Through Wexner, he acquired a seven-story stone mansion that is considered the
largest private residence in Manhattan - a 21,000-square-foot fortress with
heated sidewalks that spans the entire block on 71st Street between Fifth and
Madison Avenues.
He also owns a 10,000-acre ranch, named Zorro, in New Mexico, a private
island called Little St. James in the Virgin Islands, the $13 million house in
Palm Beach, a Gulfstream jet and, at one point, owned a Boeing 72 7.

Virginia Roberts says she was used as a sex slave for Jeffrey Epstein for years starting at the age of 16. Roberts
says that Epstein also lent her out to some of his wealthy, powerful acquaintances for sex.
COURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS
He has never been in the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans, largely
because the magazine has never been able to determine the source or the size of
his wealth.
He has been dogged by questions about his financial dealings. A former business
partner, Steven Hoffenberg, sued him in 2016, claiming that Epstein was the
mastermind behind a $500 million Ponzi scheme that Hoffenberg was
imprisoned for in 1995. Hoffenberg served 18 years for the scam, but he later
dropped the lawsuit against Epstein.
In August, two of Hoffenberg's former investors rekindled the lawsuit against
Epstein, but the case was dropped in October.
Epstein and his associate, British-born socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, were also
accused in a 2015 federal civil suit of organizing underage sex parties on his
private plane, nicknamed The Lolita Express, and at Epstein's various homes.
Maxwell, who has never been charged with wrongdoing, has denied allegations
made in the lawsuit that she was Epstein's madam. The suit, filed by victim
Virginia Roberts, was settled in 2017.
Virginia Roberts was working at Mar-a-Lago when she was recruited to be a masseuse to Palm Beach hedge fund
manager Jeffrey Epstein. She was lured into a life of depravity and sexual abuse.
BY EMILY MICHOT II I JULIE K. BROWN II
It was Epstein's contacts with powerful and famous people that first propelled him
into the public spotlight. In 2002, he flew former President Bill Clinton, actor
Kevin Spacey, comedian Chris Tucker and others to South Africa on his private jet
as part of a fact-finding AIDS mission in support of the Clinton Foundation.
But Epstein, a Clinton donor who contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to
Democratic candidates and causes, realized that his Democratic connections
weren't going to help him in 2006, when the federal prosecutor was Acosta, a
conservative Republican appointed during the George W. Bush administration.
ENTER KENNETH STARR
Epstein's tactic: hire the most aggressive and politically connected lawyers that his
money could buy.
At the top of his list: Kenneth Starr, a Republican icon because of his pursuit of
Bill Clinton during the Whitewater investigation, which led to the impeachment
(but not conviction) of the president after it was revealed he'd had sex with a
young White House intern. Like Acosta, Starr had worked at the prestigious law
firm Kirkland & Ellis. Epstein also tapped Jay Lefkowitz, also of Kirkland, who
worked as a domestic policy advisor and later as a special envoy to North Korea
during the George W. Bush presidency.

Epstein also hired Bruce Reinhart, then an assistant U.S. attorney in South
Florida, now a U.S. magistrate. He left the U.S. Attorney's Office on Jan. 1, 2008,
and went to work representing Epstein's employees on Jan. 2, 2008, court records
show. In 2011, Reinhart was named in the Crime Victims' Rights Act lawsuit,
which accused him of violating Justice Department policies by switching sides,
implying that he leveraged inside information about Epstein's investigation to
curry favor with Epstein.
Reinhart, in a sworn declaration attached to the CVRA case, denied the
allegation, saying he did not participate in Epstein's criminal case and never
learned any confidential, non-public information about the Epstein matter.
The U.S. Attorney's Office has since disputed that, saying in court papers that he
did possess confidential information about the case.
Contacted for this story, Reinhart, in an email, said he never represented Epstein
- only Epstein's pilots; his scheduler, Sarah Kellen; and Nadia Marcinkova,
described by some victims as Epstein's sex slave. Reinhart also pointed out that a
complaint filed against him by victims' lawyer Paul Cassell was dismissed by the
Justice Department.

That same year, 2011, more girls continued to come forward, including Roberts,
who claimed in a British tabloid story that Epstein directed her - while she was
underage by Florida standards - to have sex, not only with him, but with other
powerful men, including his attorney, Alan Dershowitz, and Prince Andrew.
Dershowitz and Andrew denied her claims, but after she filed a sworn affidavit in
federal court in Miami, the ensuing news media firestorm forced Acosta, then
dean of the law school at Florida International University, to explain why he'd
declined to prosecute Epstein.
In a written, public statement on March 20, 2011, Acosta asserted that the deal
he struck with Epstein's lawyers was harsher than it would have been had the case
remained with the state prosecutor, Krischer, who favored charging Epstein with
only a misdemeanor prostitution violation.
Acosta also described what he called a year-long assault on prosecutors by
Epstein's army of legal superstars who, he said, investigated individual
prosecutors and their families, looking for personal peccadilloes to disqualify
them from Epstein's case.
Dershowitz, in an interview, denied that Epstein's lawyers would ever investigate
prosecutors.
Documents nevertheless show that Acosta not only buckled under pressure from
Epstein's lawyers, but he and other prosecutors worked with them to contain the
case, even as the FBI was uncovering evidence of victims and witnesses in other
states, FBI and federal court documents show.
A 5 3-page federal indictment had been prepared in 2007, and subpoenas were
served on several of Epstein's employees, compelling them to testify before a
federal grand jury. The court records reveal that emails began to fly back and
forth between prosecutors and Epstein's legal team. Those emails show that
feder�l prosecutors kept acquiescing to Epstein's demands.
Prosecutors allowed Epstein's lawyers to dictate the terms of each deal that they
drew up, and repeatedly backed down on deadlines, so that the defense
essentially controlled the pace of the negotiations, the emails and letters show.
It's clear, from emails and other records, that prosecutors spent a lot of time
figuring out a way to settle the case with the least amount of scandal. Instead of
charging Epstein with a sex offense, prosecutors considered witness tampering
and obstruction charges, and misdemeanors that would allow Epstein to secretly
plead guilty in Miami instead of in Palm Beach County, where most of the victims
lived, thereby limiting media exposure and making it less likely for victims to
appear at the sentencing.
I've been spending some quality time with Title 18 [the U.S. criminal code]
looking for misdemeanors, the lead prosecutor, A. Marie Villafana, wrote to
Epstein's lawyers on Sept. 13, 2007, adding that she was trying to find a factual
basis for one or more non-sex-related crimes to charge him with.
The email chain shows that prosecutors sometimes communicated with the
defense team using private emails, and that their correspondence referenced
discussions that they wanted to have by phone or in person, so that there would
be no paper trail.
It's highly unusual and raises suspicions of something unethical happening when
you see emails that say 'call me, I don't want to put this in writing.' There's no
reason to worry about putting something in writing if there's nothing improper or
unethical in the case, said former federal prosecutor Francey Hakes, who
worked in the Justice Department's crimes against children unit.
On Sept. 24, 2007, another agreement was reached, but Epstein still wasn't
happy with it, emails show.
Lefkowitz continued to pressure the U.S. Attorney's Office to keep the agreement
secret, even though under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, prosecutors were
required to inform the victims that a plea deal had been signed.
We ... object to your sending a letter to the alleged victims, Lefkowitz wrote on
Nov. 28.  ... Any such letter would immediately be leaked to the press, your
actions will only have the effect of injuring Mr. Epstein and promoting spurious
civil litigation directed at him. We also request that if your office believes that it
must send a letter to go to the alleged victims ... it should happen only after Mr.
Epstein has entered his plea.''
,,, __
The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their cause remain angry over what
they regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution
agreement have prospered.
BY MARTA OLIVER CRA VIOTIO IS I EMILY MICHOT IS I JULIE K. BROWN B
By December, Epstein had still not agreed to a date for his plea hearing, and was
technically in violation of the September agreement, which required him to
appear in court by November, Acosta noted in a letter to Kenneth Starr in
December 2007.
The [U.S. attorneys] who have been negotiating with defense counsel have for
some time complained to me regarding the tactics used by the defense team,
Acosta wrote. It appears to them that as soon as resolution is reached on one
issue, defense counsel finds ways to challenge the resolution collaterally .... Some
in our office are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to mount
collateral challenges to provisions to the agreement, even after Mr. Epstein has
entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the agreement difficult, if not
impossible, to unwind.
And that's exactly what happened.
Villafana frequently showed her frustration.
I thought we had worked very well together in resolving this dispute .... I feel
that I bent over backwards to keep in mind the effect that the agreement would
have on Mr. Epstein, Villafana wrote to Epstein attorney Lefkowitz on Dec. 13,
2007.
By then the deal had been signed for two months, and Jeffrey Sloman, Acosta's
top assistant, told Lefkowitz he intended to begin notifying Epstein's victims.
An indignant Lefkowitz wrote to Acosta: You ... assured me that your office
would not ... contact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses or
potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this matter.
As the months went on, with the agreement still in limbo, federal prosecutors
once again began to prepare indictments against Epstein, court records show. The
FBI investigation briefly resumed, and additional witnesses were interviewed in
New York and New Mexico, the records show. In January 2008, several Epstein
victims were sent letters informing them that the FBI investigation was ongoing
as negotiations to finalize the plea bargain continued behind the scenes.
Starr finally appealed to the Justice Department in Washington, challenging
federal jurisdiction of the case, but in May 2008, the Justice Department affirmed
Acosta's right to prosecute.
'STILL AFRAID OF EPSTEIN'
In recent court filings, the government was forced to answer questions about its
negotiations, finally admitting in 2013 that federal prosecutors had backed down
under relentless pressure by Epstein's attorneys.
The government admits that, at least in part as a result of objections lodged by
Epstein's lawyers to victim notifications, the [United States Attorney's Office]
reevaluated its obligations to provide notification to victims and Jane Doe #l was
thus not told that the USAO had entered into a non-prosecution agreement with
Epstein until after it was signed, wrote Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee.
Said Hakes, the former federal prosecutor: I have never heard of a case where
federal prosecutors consult with a defense attorney before they send out standard
victim notification letters. To negotiate what the letters would say and whether
they would be sent at all suggest that the victims' rights were violated multiple
times.
Starr's aggressive advocacy for Epstein against allegations of improper sexual
behavior was in stark contrast to the path he took investigating then-President
Clinton. The Starr Report, the summary of his findings in the Whitewater
investigation, which started as a probe of a land deal gone sour and veered into
an investigation of sexual misconduct, savaged the president for his involvement
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and was the basis for impeachment.
Starr himself would face criticism in 2016 - he stepped down as president of
Baylor University amid allegations that he and other university officials
mishandled sexual assault allegations brought by female students against
members of the school's football team.
The Herald reached out to Starr, through certified letter and through a spokesman
for his current law firm, the Lanier Firm, but did not receive a response for this
story.
Palm Beach police detective Recarey, one of the most highly decorated officers on
the Palm Beach Police Department, called the Epstein case the most troubling of
his 23-year career.
\
Some of the victims were - and still are - afraid of Epstein, he said as part of
a series of interviews with the Herald earlier this year.
Privately, Reiter and Recarey said, they held onto a hope that Epstein would be
brought to trial someday, but they said that that notion had faded.
I always hoped that the plea would be thrown out and that these teenage girls,
who were labeled as prostitutes by prosecutors, would get to finally shed that label
and see him go to prison where he belongs, Recarey said.
Recarey died in May after a brief illness. He was 50 years old.

DA's office 'went easy' on sex offender Epstein
By Rebecca Rosenberg and Danika Fears
January 7, 2015 I 2:38am
----------
Jeffrey Epstein
Gregory P. Mango
Jeffrey Epstein may be a convicted pedophile and accused sex- slave master - but that didn't stop him from getting some tender loving
treatment from the Manhattan DA's Office.
Prosectors went to bat for the billionaire pervert at a 2011 legal hearing, asking a judge to cut the filthy- rich felon a break on the severity of
his sex- offender status, according to court documents.
ADA Jennifer Gaffney supported a request by Epstein - who allegedly peddled $15,000-a-night teen sex slaves to rich men like Britain's
Prince Andrew - that he only be listed as a Level 1 pervert during a hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court, according to legal transcripts.
The sicko investment magnate has just finished serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence in Florida for soliciting a minor girl for
prostitution. The hearing was to determine what kind of offender status he would have in New York, where he keeps a vacation home.
The city ADA argued that since there was only an indictment for one victim, Epstein shouldn't have to register as Level 3 - which would
require he travel to New York every 90 days and check in with cops.
Judge Ruth Pickholz was flabbergasted. She couldn't understand why the DA would want to go easy on Epstein, after the New York State
Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders recommended the Level 3 status because there was more than just the one victim for which he
pleaded guilty.
··1 have to tell you, I'm a little overwhelmed because I have never seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this, the judge said at the
hearing.
Despite the DA's arguments, Pickholz slapped Epstein with Level 3 status, which was upheld on appeal.
·'The strong evidence that the offenses against the other victims did occur outweighs any inferences to be drawn from the manner in which
this case was prosecuted in Florida, the New York Court of Appeals said in its ruling.
When asked for comment, the DA's Office referred The Post to court documents stating that the prosecution's position was based largely
on the mistaken notion that only the formal charges against Epstein could be factors in the decision.
The jet-setting financier has been making headlines in recent days after Virginia Roberts, 30, claimed he pimped her to Britain's Prince
Andrew.
Prince Andrew has denied the accusations against him.

Manhattan DA sided with pedophile billionaire after
botching investigation
By Rebecca Rosenberg, Larry Celona. Susan Edelman and Isabel Vincent
December 1. 2018 I 8:47pm I Updated
Jeffrey Epstein
The Manhattan DA's office once went to bat for billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein, after botching a review of his sex crimes and swallowing
his lawyers' claim that there are no real victims here, records obtained by the Post show.
Assistant DA Jennifer Gaffney, then-deputy chief of Cyrus Vance Jr.'s sex-crimes unit, in January 2011 asked a Manhattan judge to
downgrade Epstein's status in the New York sex-offender registry from the most-dangerous Level 3 to least-restrictive Level 1.
The judge was stunned.
I have never seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ruth Pickholz told Gaffney. ·1 have done
many [cases] much less troubling than this one where (prosecutors) would never make a downward argument like this.
Pressed by the judge, Gaffney admitted that she never spoke to the Florida U.S. Attorney who handled a sprawling sex-crime investigation
into the financier.
I don't think you did much of an investigation here, Pickholz said. I am shocked.
Vance's mishandling of the Epstein hearing has come under new scrutiny after a Miami Herald report last week revealed a secret nonprosecution
agreement in Florida that buried evidence Epstein had allegedly pimped out 80 girls and young women to his rich and
powerful pals.
The DA's office insists Vance was not aware of the hearing until years later and had nothing to do with it.
Our prosecutor made a mistake, Vance spokesman Danny Frost said of Gaffney.
Gaffney, a prosecutor working in the Harvey Weinstein probe, left the DA's office in September. She declined to comment.
A DA insider said the office was unaware of Epstein's secret plea deal in Florida, and never investigated his sexcapades in NYC.
Some law enforcement sources don't believe Vance had no clue that his office had a sex-offender case involving a Manhattan mogul with
close ties to Democrats.
This is very unusual, one said. There is no way Vance didn't know. The question is why - and who asked for the favor.
The FBI found Epstein recruited girls as young as 13, many runaways, from Florida, New Mexico, the Caribbean and New York, and paid
them for nude massages that often led to sex, the Herald reported. Some girls worked for a Manhattan modeling agency and lived in a
nearby apartment owned by Epstein.
But Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta - now President Trump's labor secretary - sealed a 53-page federal indictment that could have
sent Epstein to prison for life, the Herald reported.
Instead, Acosta let Epstein plead guilty to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. Sentenced to 18 months, he served just 13 - most of
it in his tony Palm Beach office.
Epstein was required to register as a sex offender in New York because one of his many homes is in Manhattan.
In the Jan. 18, 2011 hearing, Gaffney argued the evidence didn't justify the harshest status.
There is only an indictment for one victim., she said. If an offender is not indicted for an offense, it is strong evidence that the offense did
not occur.
Pickholz rejected Gaffney's arguments and gave Epstein the highest sex-offender status - Level 3.
When Epstein appealed, Vance's office admitted it had misread the law.
The appellate court upheld Pickholz, saying Epstein committed multiple offenses against a series of underage girls. and that the victim in
his indictment was only one of defendant's many victims.

Hi Sue,
Regarding your first question: pursuant to Civil Rights Law§ 50-b, our office's practice in appellate sex
crimes matters is to file documents under seal. This is not particular to People v. Epstein; it is routine
across our appellate filings. My understanding is that it is also the Appellate Division's (the court's)
practice to maintain such seal.
That being said, I have discussed your second question with our attorneys. If the Post petitions the

District Attomey of New York County, and I submit this affinnation on behalf of the People
in response to a motion filed by non-party movant NYP Holdings, Ine. (the Post) to
unseal the appellate briefs from 2011, pertaining to the adjudication of defendant Jeffrey
E. Epstein as a Level III sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA'').
Civil Rights Law § 50-b provides that the identities of the victims of sex offenses must
remain confidential and _that docwnents bearing identifying infonnation should not be made

2. In order to protect the privacy interests of victims of sex crimes, the plain
lan gua ge of Civil Rights Law § 50-b prohibits production to the public of the appellate briefs,
which would reveal the identities of many of defendant's sex crime victims. To be s1:tte, the

appropriate prosecuting agencies or to the victims themselves. And to the extent that the
Post is unable to furnish notice to the victims, this Office, which was not the prosecuting
agency, is not in a position to do so.

Re:
Motion to Unseal Briefs (with Names of Victims Redacted) in People v. Epstein, N.Y.
Co. Index No. 30129/10 (Appellate Division No. 6081)
Dear Sir or Madam:
We write on behalf of non-party movant NYP Holdings, Inc., publisher of the New York
Post (the Post''), to withdraw the motion filed by the Post on December 21, 2018 seeking an
order to unseal the briefs submitted by the parties in the above-captioned appeal (with the names
of victims redacted). Pursuant to NYCRR § 1250.2, we write to inform the Court that the Post
hereby withdraws its pending motion without prejudice and expressly reserves the right to refile
the motion. See NYCRR § 1250.2(a) (Withdrawal of Motion. A moving party may file a
written request to withdraw a motion at any time prior to its detennination).
The Post intends to refile its motion for an order unsealing the briefs (with appropriate
redactions), but has withdrawn its pending motion in response to an affidavit submitted by the
office of the Manhattan District Attorney on December 28, 2018. That affidavit asserts that the
Post was required, but failed, to provide notice of the unsealing motion to prosecutor's offices
in Florida before proceeding with its motion. While the Post firmly believes that it satisfied its
obligations by serving the Manhattan District Attorney's office with a copy of its unsealing
motion, it wishes to avoid and moot any dispute with the District Attorney's office over whether
the notice requirements of the relevant statute were met. Accordingly, the Post will refile its
motion to unseal next week and, at that time, will serve its motion papers on the relevant Florida
prosecutors, as well as on the parties to the appeal.

Non-party movant NYP Holdings, Inc., publisher of the New York Post (the Post),
respectfully submits this memorandum of law in support of its motion, filed pursuant to 22
NYCRR § 1250.l(e)(3) and N.Y. Civil Rights Law§ 50-b(2)(b), for an order unsealing the briefs
filed by the parties in the above-captioned appeal (the Appeal) with the names of victims of
sex crimes redacted.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
The Post seeks to unseal court documents that will shed light on why the Manhattan
District Attorney's Office initially sought lenient treatment of billionaire financier and convicted
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In 2008, Epstein pled guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor,
but there has been suspicion since that time - voiced by members of the judiciary and the press
alike - that prosecutors gave Epstein preferential treatment because of his wealth and his
political connections to powerful men like Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew. The
handling of criminal proceedings against Epstein by federal prosecutors in Florida and thereafter
by the Manhattan District Attorney's office has come under renewed scrutiny after the Miami
Herald published a series of investigative articles beginning November 28, 2018, including an
article reporting recently that prosecutors worked to cut him a break despite strong evidence
that he had abused 80 girls and young women.
As part of its own news reporting on the New York proceedings against Epstein, the Post
seeks to unseal the briefs filed in this Appeal, in which this Court held that Epstein had to
register as a level three sex offender in New York, which is the category reserved for highest-risk
offenders. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d 570, 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d 239,240 (1st Dep't 2011).
During the Appeal, Epstein argued that his sex offender status should be downgraded to a lower
level while the District Attorney's Office argued that the level-three designation was appropriate.
481 l•3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039
The District Attorney's position on appeal, however, was in stark contrast to what it argued in
proceedings before the lower court, which was that Epstein should be adjudicated a level one
offender (i.e., lowest risk) in spite of the damning evidence establishing that defendant
committed multiple offenses against a series of underage girls. Id. at 570-71, 933 N.Y.S.2d at
240. The public has the right to know why the Manhattan District Attorney's Office switched its
legal position on appeal and what justifications it advanced in its brief to explain its initial
request for lenient treatment of Epstein. Similarly, the briefing submitted by Epstein, which
confronted the District Attorney's arguments on appeal, may shed additional light on why the
District Attorney changed course on appeal. Despite the obvious public interest in knowing this
information, the briefs were filed wholly under seal pursuant to New York Civil Rights Law
section 50-b - which protects the anonymity of sex abuse victims - and not a single word of
either party's briefs is available to the public.
Since the District Attorney's Office has made it clear that it will not release any portion
of any of the appellate briefs filed in this action without clear instructions from this Court, the
Post respectfully requests an order unsealing the briefs and directing the District Attorney to
provide the Post with copies redacted only to the extent necessary to preserve the anonymity of
victims. As a threshold matter, the Rules of this Court and the common law both guarantee the
Post's right to move this Court for an order unsealing court documents (POINT I, supra). And
the Post easily demonstrates the good cause required to overcome sealing of documents under
section 50-b. Simply put, the presumption of openness that governs judicial proceedings in this
State is at its zenith because the documents sought by the Post are highly relevant to allegations
of prosecutorial missteps and favoritism by the office of the District Attorney in a case involving
a powerful sex offender (POINT II, supra). The Post is mindful, however, of the importance of
481 l-3721-9459vJ 3930033-000039
maintaining anonymity for the victims of sexual assault and respectfully requests that this Court
also direct the District Attorney's Office to redact the names of any victims before serving the
Post with copies of the redacted appellate briefs. The Post further requests that this Court order
the District Attorney's Office to provide the Post with copies of the redacted briefs within seven
days of entry of its order granting this motion.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A. Epstein's Conviction for Sex Crimes and Designation as a Level Three Sex Offender
In June 2008, a Florida Court sentenced Jeffrey Epstein to eighteen months in prison after
he pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a fourteen-year-old girl. Affirmation of John M.
Browning dated December 21, 2018 (Browning Aff.), Ex. A.
After serving thirteen months of his sentence, Epstein was released and required to
register as a sex offender in New York, where he owned property and sought to reside. Id. Ex.
B. The New York State Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders (NYBSO) recommended that
Epstein be designated a level three sex offender - which is the level reserved for the most
dangerous sexual predators - because investigators in Florida had found compelling evidence
that Epstein had abused scores of underage girls, despite only pleading guilty to solicitation of a
single minor. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240.
Remarkably, New York Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Gaffney ignored the NYBSO
recommendation and asked the trial court tasked with deciding Epstein's sex-offender status to
designate him as a level one offender only, which is the least-restrictive category possible and is
typically applied to offenders who pose the lowest risk of committing further crimes. Id. ADA
Gaffney argued that, since there was only an indictment for one victim, Epstein should not be
placed under the heavy scrutiny required for the most dangerous class of abusers. Id. Ex. B. For
48l l-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039
,..
their part, Epstein's lawyers argued that the lowest designation should be applied because there
are no real victims here. Id. Ex. C.
In January 2011, the judge presiding over the sex-offender registration proceedings,
Justice Ruth Pickholz, rejected ADA Gaffney's arguments and designated Epstein as a level
three sex offender. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240. At a hearing preceding her
ruling, Justice Pickholz told the Assistant District Attorney that she had never seen the
prosecutor's office do anything like this and further stated that she had done many [cases]
much less troubling than this one where [prosecutors] would never make a downward argument
like this. Id. Ex. B. When ADA Gaffney was questioned about whether she knew Epstein had
sexually abused other minors, Gaffney admitted that she had never spoken to the federal
investigators in Florida who had reached the conclusion that Epstein was a serial abuser of
underage girls. Id. Ex. C.
B. The Appeal
Epstein subsequently commenced this Appeal, seeking to overturn the trial court's ruling
that he is a level three sex offender. The appellate briefs submitted by Epstein and the
Manhattan District Attorney were filed under seal, pursuant to New York Civil Rights Law
section 50-b. Id. ,i 7. That statute protects the anonymity of any victim of a sex offense by
requiring any court file ... which tends to identify such a victim to be filed under seal. N.Y.
Civ. Rights Law § 50-b(l ). The statute further provides, however, that court documents filed
under seal shall be disclosed if a movant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that good
cause exists for disclosure to that person. Id. § 50-b(2)(b).
In a decision filed on the public docket (the Decision), this Court affirmed Epstein's
level three offender status because the lower court properly relied on highly reliable proof of
criminal conduct for which defendant was neither indicted nor convicted. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at
481 l-3721-9459v 3 3930033-000039
4
570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240. Specifically, the evidence ... established that [Epstein] committed
multiple offenses against a series of underage girls, who were brought to [Epstein's] home to
provide 'massages' that led to very serious sex crimes. Id. at 570-71, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240.
_
Although the Manhattan District Attorney's briefing remains under seal, the Decision
indicates that the People [took] a different position on appeal from the position they took before
the hearing court. Id. at 571, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 241. This Court did not, however, unseal any of
the appeal briefs or provide a detailed summary of the parties' respective arguments. The public
and the press are thus left in the dark as to what exactly the District Attorney's Office and
Epstein wrote in their respective appeal briefs. It appears that the District Attorney's Office may
have taken the position that ADA Gaffney had mistakenly conceded [before the lower court]
that the conduct for which defendant was not indicted should not be considered, and that
defendant should be adjudicated a level one offender. Id. at 572,933 N.Y.S.2d at 241. The
Decision also states that this Court rejected Epstein's argument that the District Attorney should
be estopped  from changing position on appeal and also rejected Epstein's remaining claims  as
being improperly raised for the first time on appeal. Id. The public has the right to know more
than these sketchy details, however, particularly when the arguments advanced by the parties on
appeal clearly discuss the decision taken by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to abruptly
change its earlier position that Epstein was deserving of lenient treatment.
C. Media Interest in New York and Florida Prosecutors' Lenient Handling of Epstein's
Case
The handling of Epstein's prosecution in Florida and the subsequent sex offender
registration proceeding against in him New York have both been the subject of legitimate public
interest and intense controversy. In the Florida proceedings, the prosecutors were criticized for
allowing Epstein to enter into a seemingly favorable plea deal. For instance, as the Post reported
48 \ l-372 l-9459v.3 3930033-000039
at the time, the Florida judge sentencing Epstein was critical of two of the deal's conditions,
indicating she thought he was getting special treatment by being allowed private counselling for
his sex offender treatment and to serve time in county jail instead of state prison. Samuel
Goldsmith, Jeffrey Epstein Pleads Guilty to Prostitution Charges, N.Y. POST (June 30, 2008),
available at https ://nypost.com/2008/06/30/j effrey-epstein-pleads-guilty-to-prostitu ti on-charges/.
Another serious concern was that Epstein's status as a billionaire investor with powerful
connections - including close relationships with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and Prince Andrew
- may have influenced prosecutors to give Epstein unduly favorable treatment and to tum a blind
eye to the extent of his sexual abuse of minors. Id.
There has also been critical reporting on how the Manhattan District Attorney's Office
handled Epstein's sex offender registration hearings in New Yark. After the Post obtained
copies of the transcript of the status hearing before Justice Pickholz, it published an article on
January 7, 2015, entitled DA's office 'went easy' on sex offender Epstein. Id. Ex. B. In that
article, the Post reported that Prosecutors went to bat for the billionaire pervert at a 2011 legal
hearing, asking a judge to cut the filthy-rich felon a break on the severity of his sex-offender
status ....  Id. In addition to reporting the contents of the hearing transcript, Post reporters also
sought to discover why the District Attorney initially sought lenient treatment for Epstein and, as
part of its investigation, reached out for comment from the District Attorney's Office. As the
article reported, the spokesman for the District Attorney did not give a detailed response on the
record but referred the Post instead to the portion of the Decision stating that the prosecution's
position was based 'largely on the mistaken notion' that only the formal charges against Epstein
could be factors in the decision. Id. The Post was unable to obtain copies of the briefs filed
4811-372 l-9459v.3 3930033-000039
with the First Department- which would provide a more fulsome explanation of the District
Attorney's position - because those documents remained under seal.
The prosecution of Epstein has remained in the news and was recently the subject of a
wide-ranging mvestigation by the Miami Herald, which was published on November 28, 2018.
Id. Ex. A. One of several in-depth feature articles published by the Miami Herald was entitled
Cops worked to put serial sex abuser in prison. Prosecutors worked to cut him a break. Id. In
that article, the Miami Herald reported that investigators uncovered evidence that Epstein had
abused over 100 middle school and high school aged girls, but despite ample physical
evidence and multiple witnesses corroborating the girls' stories, federal prosecutors and
Epstein's lawyers quietly put together a remarkable deal for Epstein. Id. Epstein agreed to
plead guilty to soliciting an underage prostitute in state court, and in exchange, he and his
accomplices received immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to
prison for life. Id. More troubling still, Epstein's case file was sealed- including a detailed
criminal complaint- so that no one ... could know the full scope of Epstein's crimes and who
else was involved. Id.
The Miami Herald's reporting has also had serious political ramifications. As the Miami
Herald has reported, [t]he U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, was personally involved
in the negotiations back in and around 2008. Id. Ex. C. Acosta subsequently became a
member of President Donald Trump's cabinet and currently serves as the Secretary of Labor.
Id. Since the Miami Herald published its expose, some members of Congress have demanded an
investigation into what led to the slap-on-the-wrist punishment for Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,
Anthony Man, Florida Democrats want investigation into Trump cabinet member's role in
handling Epstein case, SOUTH FLORIDA SUN SENTINEL (Dec. 4, 2018) available at
48 I I-372 l-9459v.3 3930033-000039
https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/f1-ne-jeffrey-epstein-alex-acosta-investigation-
20181204-story .html.
The Post has also persisted with its own investigation into whether the Manhattan District
Attorney's Office was unduly lenient when it advocated in favor of registering Epstein as a level
one sex offender. On December 1, 2018, the Post published an article entitled Manhattan DA
sided with pedophile billionaire after botching investigation. Id. Ex. C. Following up on its
prior reporting, the Post reported Justice Pickholz's denial of ADA Gaflhey's efforts to register
Epstein as a level one offender and then asked the District Attorney's Office to account for the
mishandling of the Epstein hearing. Id. In response to questions from the Post, the District
Attorney's Office insisted that ADA Gaffney simply made a mistake. Id. A spokesman also
claimed that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance 'was not aware' of the hearing until
years later and had nothing to do with it. Id. But, as the Post also reported, [s]ome law
enforcement sources don't believe Vance had no clue that his office had a sex-offender case
involving a Manhattan mogul with close ties to Democrats. Id.
Unsealing of the First Department appeal briefs in this case is crucial so that the public
and the press may more fully understand why Epstein was initially offered level one offender
status despite the overwhelming evidence that he was a serial sexual abuser of children.
D. The Post's Efforts to Obtain the Appellate Briefing Filed with the First Department
On December 4, 2018, Post reporter Sue Edelman contacted the Director of
Communications for District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. and requested a copy of the appellate
brief filed by the District Attorney's Office. Id. 116-8. In making this request, Edelman
specifically stated that the District Attorney's Office could redact the names of any victims of
sexual abuse before forwarding the brief. Id. Edelman's request was denied, however, because

entirety pursuant to N.Y. Civil Rights Law section 50-b and could not be released- even with
the names of victims redacted - without an order from this Court. Id. Nonetheless, the District
Attorney's Office stated in an email that it would not oppose the Post's motion requesting that
a redacted brief be produced. Id. Ex. D.
Counsel for the Post also contacted counsel for Epstein to ascertain his position on the
disclosure of the appellate briefs. Id. On December 20, 2018, Mr. Epstein's lawyer stated that
he would not take a position until he had an opportunity to review the brief and reserved his right
to oppose. Counsel for Epstein later informed counsel for the Post that after consideration of
your request for the unsealing of the appellate briefs with redactions of certain identities, we take
no position on behalf of Mr. Epstein. Id. Ex. F.
On December 21, 2019, the Post moved this Court for an order unsealing the appellate
briefs and directing the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to produce copies of the briefs with
the names of victims redacted (the December 21 Motion). On January 2, 2019, counsel for the
Post received an affirmation signed by Assistant District Attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo,
dated December 28, 2018, which opposed the December 21 Motion. After telling the Post that it
will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief, the District Attorney's Office argued that the
December 21 Motion should be denied on two grounds. First, the District Attorney's office
faulted the Post for supposedly failing to furnish the requisite notice to the prosecuting
agencies for defendant's underlying sex crimes, as required by section 50-b of the New York
Civil Rights Act. Id. Ex. E ,i 2. According to the Manhattan District Attorney, the Post should
have notified the federal and local prosecutor's offices in Florida, where defendant was
charged (and presumably not the Manhattan District Attorney's Office). 1
1
The Post firmly disputes the District Attorney's contention -which is not supported by any authority- that section
50-b requires the Post to serve any prosecutor who touched Epstein's case in Florida in order to unseal documents
48! l-372!-9459v.3 3930033-000039
Second, Assistant District Attorney Friedman Agnifilo objected to unsealing any portion
of the appellate briefs and wrote that we cannot agree ... even to a production of the people's
brief with redactions of the names or initials of Epstein's victims. Id. ,i 3. She further noted,
however, that if this Court is inclined to grant the Post's motion, we would not oppose
producing a copy of the People's brief, with substantial redactions necessary to protect the
identities of the victims but keeping intact those portions of the brief that recount the procedural
history of the SORA hearing. Id.
Although the Post does not agree that section 50-b requires it to notify Florida
prosecutors of its intention to move this Court to unseal briefs filed by the Manhattan District
Attorney in a New York sex offenders proceeding, it nonetheless voluntarily withdrew the
December 21 Motion on January 4, 2019 to moot the issue and bypass an easily avoidable
procedural dispute. Counsel for the Post has contacted the Palm Beach State Attorney's office
and the lJ_nited States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (collectively, the
Florida Prosecutors) to apprise them of its intention to refile this motion to unseal the appellate
briefs with the names of victims redacted. Id. ,i,i 1 7-18. The Post will also serve the Florida
Prosecutors with copies of this motion.
Having mooted the procedural objection raised by the Manhattan District Attorney, the
Post now refiles its motion respectfully requesting an order unsealing the appellate briefs and
directing the District Attorney's Office to provide the Post with copies - with the names of
victims redacted - within seven days of the entry of its order.
filed by New York prosecutors in a New York court as part of proceedings to register Epstein as a sex-offender in
New York State. The statute requires a movant to furnish notice to the public officer ... with the duty of
prosecuting the offense. N.Y. Civ. Rights Law §50-b. Here, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office had the
duty of prosecuting the offense on behalf of the People of New York - i.e., the sex-offender registration
proceedings against Epstein in this State - and there is no question that the Post provided the Manhattan District
Attorney with adequate notice of the December 21 Motion.

IO
ARGUMENT
Despite the Manhattan District Attorney's apparent opposition to releasing any of portion
of the appellate briefs, good cause exists to unseal briefs with victims' names redacted because
the handling of Epstein's designation as a sex offender by New York prosecutors- including the
appellate arguments regarding that designation - are of paramount public concern and should be
open to public scrutiny.
I. THE POST HAS THE RIGHT TO MOVE THIS COURT FOR AN ORDER
UNSEALING THE APPELLATE BRIEFING
As a threshold matter, the Practice Rules of this Court permit non-parties (like the Post)
to submit [a]pplications for sealing and unsealing documents ... by motion. 22 NYCRR
§ 1250.l(e)(3). The Post's right to petition this Court for an order unsealing the appellate briefs
is further buttressed by the rule that affected members of the media should be given the
opportunity to be heard before a Court takes the drastic step of sealing court proceedings, filings
or dockets. In re Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v. Moynihan, 125 A.D.2d 34, 38,512
N.Y.S.2d 266,269 (3d Dep't 1987), aff'd on other grounds, 71 N.Y.2d 263,525 N.Y.S.2d 24
(1988). See also Mancheski v. Gabe/Ii Grp. Capital Partners, 39 A.D.3d 499,501,835
N.Y.S.2d 595, 597 (2d Dep't 2007) ([P]rior to issuance of an order to seal judicial documents,
the court is obligated, where possible, to afford news media an opportunity to be heard.) (citing
In re Herald Co. v. Weisenberg, 59 N.Y.2d 378,383,465 N.Y.S.2d 862, 864 (1983)); Maxim,
Inc. v. Feifer, 145 A.D.3d 516, 43 N.Y.S.3d 313 (1st Dep't 2016) (reversing order denying
motion of press entities to intervene for purpose of seeking access to filed motion papers and
other court records).
In addition to guaranteeing the Post's right to move this Court to unseal documents, New
York law also requires this Court to make specific findings to support its determination before
481 l-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039
11
limiting public access to judicial records or proceedings. Daily News, L.P. v. Wiley, 126 A.D.3d
511,515, 6 N.Y.S.3d 19, 24 (1st Dep't 2015) (before sealing records, courts must adhere
strictly to the procedures set forth in the controlling case law including affording a full
opportunity by any interested members of the press to be heard, and making specific findings to
support its determination .... [T]rial court[s] ... cannot ... seal evidence and transcripts
merely because the parties are consenting to same and the case has obtained notoriety.).
Therefore, in the unlikely event that this Court declines to grant the Post's motion to unseal,
either in part or in toto, the Post respectfully requests that this Court issue a written order setting
forth the grounds for its decision.
II.
GOOD CAUSE EXISTS TO UNSEAL THE APPELLATE BRIEFS
The appellate briefs should be disclosed because they are highly relevant to the public's
understanding of whether the Office of the Manhattan District Attorney-whose fundamental
mission is to protect the people of this State - initially showed undue deference to a dangerous
pedophile, who is unusually rich and well-connected.
New York Civil Rights Law section 50-b permits courts to disclose court documents
relating to the commission of a sexual offense whenever a showing is made that good cause
exists for disclosure. N.Y. Civ. Rights Law§ 50-b. See also 22 NYCCR § 1250.l(e)(3)
(permitting the unsealing [of] court records ... upon good cause shown ). Good cause clearly
exists for disclosing the appellate briefs because they contain a full explanation for why the
District Attorney's Office argued before the lower court that Epstein should be registered as a
level one sex offender before changing position on appeal. See Epstein, 89 A.O. at 571, 933
N.Y.S.2d at 241. The appellate briefs may also shed light on the extent ofthe evidence ... that
[Epstein] committed multiple offenses against a series of underage girls, which the District
48 I 1-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039
12
Attorney's Office apparently disregarded or was not aware of in the proceedings before the lower
court. Id.
Not only are the appellate briefs subject to the strong presumption of openness that
applies to all judicial documents but there is also an intense public interest in disclosing these
specific documents because they will shed light on why the District Attorney's Office initially
took the controversial decision to argue in favor of lenient treatment ofEpstein. 2 As Justice
Burger wrote, [p ]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but
it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing. Richmond
Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 572 (1980). Only a free and unrestrained press can
effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free
press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people .... N.Y.
Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 717 (1971) (Black, J. concurring). In short, the
appellate briefs should be unsealed so that the Post can inform the public about the decisions
taken by the District Attorney's Office with respect to Epstein so that the public can decide
whether there was anything careless or improper about those decisions.
The need for transparency and public understanding of why the District Attorney's Office
handled the Epstein case the way it did is heightened by the fact that District Attorney Vance has
faced criticism over claims that his office gives favorable treatment to rich and powerful men
2
The presumption ofopenness is grounded in the U.S. and New York Constitutions as well as deeply-entrenched
common law rules that govern this Court. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I,
section 8 of the New York State Constitution both recognize the presumptive right of the public and press to access
and inspect court records. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. I (1986); Globe Newspaper Co. v.
Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596 (1982); In re Associated Press v. Bell, 70 N.Y.2d 32,517 N.Y.S.2d 444 {1987). In
addition to being well established under the federal and state constitutions, the right of access to court records is
also firmly grounded in common law principles. Danco Labs., Ltd v. Chem. Works of Gideon Richter, Ltd., 274
A.D.2d 1, 6, 711 N.Y.S.2d 419,423 (1st Dep't 2000)(citing inter alia Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S.
589, 597 {1978)). See also People v. Burton, 189 A.D.2d 532, 535-36, 597 N.Y.S.2d 488, 491-92 (3d Dep't 1993)
(a common-law presumption favors public access to court records); In re Application of National Broad. Co., 635
F.2d 945, 949 (2d Cir. 1980) ([T]he common law right to inspect and copy judicial records is beyond dispute.)

accused of sexual abuse. As the New Yorker reported, DA Vance declined to charge Harvey
Weinstein with a sex crime in 2015 even though investigators collected ample evidence that he
had groped an actress without consent. See Jennie Suk Gersen, Why Didn't the Manhattan DA
Prosecute the Trumps or Harvey Weinstein, NEW YORKER (Oct. 13, 2017) available at
https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-didnt-manhattan-da-cyrus-vance-prosecutethe-trumps-or-harvey-weinstein.
Even after the emergence of the #Me Too movement and the
indictment of Harvey Weinstein on rape charges, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office has
continued to face criticism for failing to prosecute the Weinstein case aggressively enough. Id.
District Attorney Vance is an elected official who wields an immense amount of discretion over
prosecutions. The people of New York have the right to scrutinize how his office treated this
case involving a rich and well-connected sex offender, especially in light of allegations that other
notable sexual predators have benefitted from the apparent deference of prosecutors. To put it
bluntly, the appellate briefs should be released immediately to avoid any impression of
impropriety caused by continued secrecy.
There is also a strong interest in disclosing the appellate briefs to enable the public to
review for itself the arguments that led this Court to issue the Decision affirming Epstein's status
as a level three sex offender. By ensuring public access to the courts and enabling public
discussion of the functioning of the judiciary, the news media help the public to participate in
and serve as a check upon the judicial process - an essential component in our structure of selfgovernment.
Globe Newspaper Co., 457 U.S. at 606. As courts have recognized time and
again, [w]ithout access to the proceedings, the public cannot analyze and critique the reasoning
of the court. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. FTC, 710 F.2d 1165, 1178 (6th Cir. 1983).
Thus, [ o ]penness ... enhances both the basic fairness of[ a] trial and the appearance of fairness
481 l-372 l-9459v.3 3930033-000039
14
so essential to public confidence in the system. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464
U.S. 501, 508 (1984) (citing Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. 569-71). For this reason, the
appellate briefs should be unsealed so that the public has the benefit of seeing the very
statements and arguments that formed the basis of this Court's Decision. It is especially
important to provide a transparent view into these judicial proceedings because suspicions have
already been raised about how the District Attorney's Office handled Epstein's case.
When, as here, issues of major public importance are involved, the interests of the
public as well as the press in access to court records 'weigh heavily' in favor of release. Danco,
274 A.D.2d at 8, 711 N.Y.S.2d at 425 (citation omitted). This constitutional presumption of
open access to court records requires the most compelling circumstances to justify any
restriction upon that right. In re Application of Nat 'I Broa d . Co., 635 F .2d at 952. Here, it is
impossible to conceive of any circumstances that might justify wholesale sealing of relevant
court documents that are necessary to understand how prosecutors and this Court handled a
matter of such intense public concern.
The interest of Epstein's victims to remain anonymous can be satisfied by directing the
District Attorney's Office to redact the names of victims before disclosing the appellate briefs.
To be clear, the Post has no interest in identifying victims of sexual assault who wish to remain
anonymous. It does, however, have a right to know why the Manhattan District Attorney
abruptly changed position after initially arguing that Epstein should be treated leniently. The
District Attorney's Office has indicated that it would not oppose producing a copy of the
People's brief ... keeping intact those portions of the brief that recount the procedural history of
the SORA hearing, the portion of the brief that is seemingly of interest to the Post. Browning
Aff. Ex. E. With all due respect to the District Attorney, the Post is simply not in a position to
4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039
15
evaluate whether the proposed redactions are reasonable. Because the Post cannot review any
part of the briefs, it is impossible for the Post to know whether the information it seeks is in the
procedural history section of the People's brief or in other parts of the briefing filed in the
Appeal. Moreover, courts must order narrow redactions where possible to avoid overbroad
sealing. See, e.g., Burton, 189 A.D.2d at 535-36, 597 N.Y.S.2d at 491 (requiring courts to
consider less drastic alternatives to sealing the records which would adequately serve the
competing interests); Maxim, Inc., 145 A.D.3d at 518, 43 N.Y.S.3d at 316 (We recognize that
it may be easier for the parties and the motion court to seal an entire court record, rather than
make a determination on a document by document basis about sealing, but administrative
convenience is not a compelling reason to justify sealing.). In keeping with this State's strong
preference against wholesale sealing of documents, section 50-b expressly permits this Court to
release judicial documents after ordering redactions as it deems necessary .. . to preserve the
confidentiality of the identity of the victim. N.Y. Civ. Rights Law§ 50-b. Since the only
information protected by the statute is identity of Epstein's victims, the Post respectfully requests
an order directing the District Attorney to redact only the names of Epstein's victims. 3
Since the Post does not seek the names of victims of sexual abuse and agrees that these
names should be redacted before the appellate briefs are disclosed, there should be no need under
the statute to provide notice to the victim or other person legally responsible for the care of the
victim. N.Y. Civ. Rights Law§ 50-b(2). But to the extent such notice is necessary, the Post is
unable to notify any of the victims on its own because it has no knowledge of which victims (if
any) may be identified in the requested documents. If the statute requires victims to be notified
3
Without the benefit of reviewing the appellate briefs, the Post is not in a position to evaluate whether the briefs
contain other information that might identify Epstein's victims, such as home addresses. While the Post would not
object to the District Attorney's Office making good faith redactions of genuinely identifying information, these
redactions should be narrowly tailored and no more expansive than is necessary to protect the victims' identities.
48l l-372l-9459v.3 3930033-000039
16
even if their names will not be disclosed, the Post respectfully submits that either the Manhattan
District Attorney or the Florida Prosecutors should provide notice promptly. To require the Post
to notify victims itself - without any ability to discover who those victims are - would be an
absurd result that defeats the purpose of the unsealing provision of section 50-b, which allows
any person to file an application requesting that infonnation be unsealed for good cause.''4
In sum, the strong presumption of openness that governs New York courts compels the
conclusion that the appellate briefs in this action must be unsealed (with the names of any
victims of a sexual offense redacted).
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Post respectfully requests an order unsealing the
appellate briefs, which directs the District Attorney to provide counsel for the Post with copies of
these documents, with the names of victims redacted, within seven days of the issuance of this
Court's unsealing order.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011718.txt,"with terror attacks, a major military response was highly unlikely. Saddam’s
successors were never going to be Zionists. But we were persuaded that his
uniquely central role meant the threat to Israel would be dramatically reduced.

I’m much less sure whether the elder President Bush, whose election defeat
to Bill Clinton came just two days before our final exercise in the Negev, would
have agreed with the attack. After the victory in the Gulf War, Bush had
deliberately stopped short of sending American forces on to Baghdad. He was
also vice-president, under Reagan, when Israel had bombed Saddam’s nuclear
reactor — an attack publicly condemned by Washington. I did ask him some
years ago whether the Gulf War might have been handled differently if Israel
hadn’t taken out Saddam’s nuclear program a decade earlier. “What if he’d had
a couple of crude nuclear devices,” I said. President Bush smiled in response.
He said he didn’t deal with “hypotheticals.”

Yet any idea of an Israeli attack on Saddam became instantly irrelevant once
foreign media reports had disclosed the reason for our ill-fated military exercise
in the Negev. Inside Israel, the focus, and the controversy, shifted to the
accident itself.

The foreign media reports of the operation we were planning proved
remarkably accurate. Some of the details still remain classified, but we were
going to use one of our new “stand-off” weapons systems: a camera-guided
missile that could be fired from a considerable distance away and, in
coordination with one of the Sayeret Matkal soldiers nearer in, maneuvered in
for the strike. After months of planning and intelligence work, we were
confident that we’d found a way to get the sayeret unit into Iraq, target Saddam
at an event we knew he would be attending, isolate and kill him with minimal
danger of any other casualties, and get our unit out safely again. The Negev
exercise was a run-through of the entire operation. It lasted nearly 48 hours. And
it culminated in a simulation of the missile attack on Saddam.

I was there as an observer along with Amnon Lipkin, my deputy chief-of-
staff; as well as the head of military intelligence, the head of operations and
Amiram Levin. We assembled at dawn for the simulation of the missile attack.
We watched from a few hundred yards away as a group of young Israeli soldiers
walked into a wide area in front of us: posing as Saddam” and his entourage.
We — and they — knew that this was just the first part of the exercise. In a Land
Rover more than five miles away, a member of the sayeret strike unit would be
confirming coordinates and, in rapid succession, “firing” two of the precision
missiles. But this was just to confirm that the targeting system had worked

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030300.txt,"the difference between prostitution and pedophilia.

So, it is baffling that Mr. Epstein, who was indicted last month by a grand jury on one
felony count of solicitation of prostitution, has not been charged, as Palm Beach police
strenuously urged, with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious
molestation.

Conviction of crimes against minors would mean steeper penalties than the maximum
five-year prison term Mr. Epstein faces if convicted of the single count of felony
solicitation. It also would help carry a message of intolerance to perverts who prey on
girls.

Prosecutors did not pursue charges against Mr. Epstein reflecting the age of the victims
because they assumed a jury would view the girls not as victims but as promiscuous,
untrustworthy, willing participants. The presumption is offensive.

Mr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law
professor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney Jack Goldberger, has denied knowing
how old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses
under oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that
police found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home,
provide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers.

One girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another
time, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his massage session because the girl he wanted was
still in class.

Why didn't State Attorney Barry Krischer let a jury decide whether to believe the
teenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to work in
December 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas
gifts?

Prosecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in
an apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that
some of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use.

The 20-year-old Royal Palm Beach woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr.
Epstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name Pimpin'
Made EZ.

Although no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of
the teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men.
Police determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr.
Goldberger denied knowing anything about it.

Police also note in their reports that the state attorney's office offered Mr. Epstein a plea
deal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to
walk away with no criminal record at all.

I asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a
grand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And
shouldn't the victims' credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been
committed, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm

Beach Post of Mr. Epstein, He's never denied girls came to the house.)

Introduction

1.1 AI Returns to Its Roots

Our goal in this book is straightforward, albeit ambitious: to present a conceptual and technical
design for a thinking machine, a software program capable of the same qualitative sort of general
intelligence as human beings. It’s not certain exactly how far the design outlined here will be
able to take us, but it seems plausible that once fully implemented, tuned and tested, it will be
able to achieve general intelligence at the human level and in some respects beyond.

Our ultimate aim is Artificial General Intelligence construed in the broadest sense, including
artificial creativity and artificial genius. We feel it is important to emphasize the extremely
broad potential of Artificial General Intelligence systems. The human brain is not built to be
modified, except via the slow process of evolution. Engineered AGI systems, built according to
designs like the one outlined here, will be much more susceptible to rapid improvement from
their initial state. It seems reasonable to us to expect that, relatively shortly after achieving the
first roughly human-level AGI system, AGI systems with various sorts of beyond-human-level
capabilities will be achieved.

Though these long-term goals are core to our motivations, we will spend much of our time here
explaining how we think we can make AGI systems do relatively simple things, like the things
human children do in preschool. The penultimate chapter of (Part 2 of) the book describes a
thought-experiment involving a robot playing with blocks, responding to the request Build me
something I haven’t seen before. We believe that preschool creativity contains the seeds of,
and the core structures and dynamics underlying, adult human level genius ... and new, as yet
unforeseen forms of artificial innovation.

Much of the book focuses on a specific AGI architecture, which we call CogPrime, and which
is currently in the midst of implementation using the OpenCog software framework. CogPrime
is large and complex and embodies a host of specific decisions regarding the various aspects of
intelligence. We don’t view CogPrime as the unique path to advanced AGI, nor as the ultimate
end-all of AGI research. We feel confident there are multiple possible paths to advanced AGI,
and that in following any of these paths, multiple theoretical and practical lessons will be
learned, leading to modifications of the ideas possessed while along the early stages of the path.
But our goal here is to articulate one path that we believe makes sense to follow, one overall
design that we believe can work.

These conspiracy theories are an aberration and an insult to the memory of the crash victims, including the late 
President himself As a Pole who is at least somewhat aware of the politics and economics of Poland, and a 
journalist who follows world politics and news developments daily, I am severely disappointed at the number of 
people that are flocking to these conspiracy theories, and academics and professionals who propagate such ideas 
should themselves feel ashamed. 
Firstly, there is absolutely no proof that there was any sabotage or subterfuge by either the Russians or the 
Prime Minister's political allies. Such accusations, then, without presenting any credible evidence, are 
slanderous. 
Also, there would be no political or diplomatic capital gained by either of the accused... there would be little 
for the Russian government to gain - it would be a huge diplomatic embarrassment for the Russian government 
to be found guilty of essentially assassinating a head of state. Kaczynski was one of the strongest allies of the 
U.S. among European leaders, and even Russia with its assertive diplomatic policies would not risk a complete 
breakdown with the U.S. by killing a close ally. International condemnation would also follow, and the 
President - perhaps even the Prime Minister - would have to resign and wave good-bye to any political career in 
the foreseeable future. Yes, even in Russia. 
Similarly, for the Prime Minister's party, if he were actually complicit in the crash, that would mean he - or his 
allies - committed a coup d'etat. Also, there will be early presidential elections in June, which might actually go 
in favor of the President's party because of a sympathy vote. The acting Presidency is in the hands of his party 
for only two months... so, again, the Prime Minister and his allies have nothing to gain and potentially 
everything to lose in the June vote. 
Conspiracy-monging cheapens a national tragedy 
Political profit or loss questions aside, however, the conspiracy-monging seems to be taken as a way to discover 
who's responsible for the tragedy and thus somehow bring them justice. However, it is not a healthy way to deal 
with the tragedy. It is not conducive to national or personal healing. Furthermore, it disgraces and taints the 
memory of those who died. 
It only cheapens the tragedy and, sadly, may foreshadow what's to come in the coming presidential campaign - 
the tragedy may be used by certain groups or individuals to propagate their own agenda and assume the 
presidency. 
It is not so different than what has been going on in the U.S., with the birthers claiming Barack Obama is not 
legally the President because he is not actually a citizen, or even natural-born citizen. Not as morbid, of course, 
but still, in my honest opinion, ridiculous. 
Baseless, nonsensical conspiracies simply destroys the abiltiy of the nation and people of Poland to move on 
and honor the memory of those lost, and cheapens the tragedy that has been felt by Poles as far away as Chicago

violating the law, claiming that the movement has become an umbrella cover for extremists, from the left and right, who are
calling for the downfall of the regime. Officials have, however, denied allegations that the government has decided to forbid
the movement from protesting.

Bahrain

Sources suggest that the opposition plans to resume protests for democratic reforms as soon as the emergency law is lifted
on June 1.

According to reports, Saudi officials have approached Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Central Asian states to lend
diplomatic support and, possibly, military assistance to the Gulf Cooperation Council's presence in Bahrain. Saudi national
security adviser, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, has reportedly asked for Pakistani support in Bahrain, including the possible
integration of Pakistani troops into the approximately 4000 Saudis already posted there. Malaysia has already indicated its
willingness to send troops to Bahrain.

Saudi Arabia

Protesters in eastern Saudi Arabia, an area mostly populated by Saudi Shiites, believed their movement would spread to
other parts of the country, but the protests remained confined to the East. The youth movement ended its protests there,
following pressure from community elders and the arrests of 150 demonstrators. Activists believe that the protests for
democratic reforms and an end to sectarian discrimination will eventually resume. Riyadh remains concerned that Iran is
manipulating Shiite sentiments and the desire for reforms in order to further lranian foreign policy objectives.

Manal al-Sharif—an information technology expert—was detained for five days on Sunday on charges of disturbing public
order. Sharif was arrested while driving in the eastern city of Dammam with her brother sitting next to her, challenging the
law that forbids Saudi females from driving.

Her arrest has been highlighted on both Facebook and Twitter, with a call to Saudi women to drive en masse on June 17.
The campaign has so far attracted 12,000 followers on Facebook. Saudi Arabia is the only country that forbids women from
driving. The Saudi government wants to prevent the rise of a movement, using social media having observed similar protest
movements in other Arab states. An online petition to free Sharif, addressed to King Abdullah, has attracted more than 600
signatures by both men and women.

Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch 
up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor 
development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-
level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it 
is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place.

It could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a more 
hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal patterns, 
delayed gratification for agriculture etc. 
and CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time , and 
structure of interactions. . 
I suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social 
and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and 
learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts 
and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they 
enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in 
math, because it does not help people or yield social attention. 
Men tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with 
people, one will not have good social cognition. 
IQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I suspect 
historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually independent and 
anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to find in Asia. 
At the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to 
understanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in a 
motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in 
music. 
It would mean that Chomsky's life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical 
language, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational urge 
to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a natural 
language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit. 
i my self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of those

Making having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a more 
humane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more children, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025955 
because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation. Humans are a 
hardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given population die. 
I suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate 
change itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But who knows, I 
might be wrong.

The radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized organism 
is fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if someone could 
pull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a virus that 
everybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very uncomfortable (I visited 
KZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans inoculated ourselves very 
thoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider it. 
I rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series The Man in the High Castle, which explores 
what would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as a 
brutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not a 
flat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book Starship Troopers explores fascism, too, 
but unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order. 
I find your political incorrectness very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly signaling, 
but now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in your youth? 
Did you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person you want to 
transform into. 
It was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything 
remotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether democracy still 
works, and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others, 
hard in oneself A speaker felt that the media stifle all criticism of Trump, another wanted to remove men 
and Elon Musk from government, and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere. 
I noticed some time ago that Joi has remarkable public communication skills. He picks controversial, insight-
laden topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his audience with 
symbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates with them. The non-
controversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very subversive, while rarely 
offending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance). 
He also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for him. 
This invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very few of 
his ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from others. 
I am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. Joi is 
right. Public communication is about reaching one's goals.

Dear Jeffrey, 
thank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail. 
Sorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive when 
I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam (who was as 
always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not feel like 
conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that humans have 
very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other ideas), and his 
frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them. 
I found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a 
cultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, but 
it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a very 
intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition works 
layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few years to 
train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and after the low 
level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts in child 
development, that have famously been described by Piaget. 
The first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The 
switching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in other 
apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their brains are 
mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations are quite a bit 
faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in very poor and 
socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive development even 
after controlling for family income. 
Gorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4 
years. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their brains 
have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are literally 
smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower levels, they 
can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to train them. 
The second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention 
to, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual 
will find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. If a brain gets lots of rewards for discovering 
other people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition. 
Language might be the result of three things that are different in humans: 
- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set of 
phonemes or the first language) 
- more layers 
- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that makes us 
like music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy making themselves 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025957 
understood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning figures out on its own. 
This is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected for 
instance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the same 
group, slower development often indicates defects, of course.) 
Another support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn visual and 
auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic image recognition into 
their current photo app: 
http://blogs.wsj . com/digits/2015/07/01/go ogle-mistakenly-tags-black-p eop le-as-gorillas-showing-limits-o f-
algorithms/  
The state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to imagine things. I.e. when the 
experimenter asks the system to dream what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a somewhat 
compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is something nobody 
could do a few months ago: 
http://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4WG6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-generator-
networks  
A machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision or 
hand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about 130 lines of 
Python code. 
These models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They 
currently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn object 
features, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost everything else is 
missing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, and that we can learn motor 
simulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in Al do not work on this, however. They 
try to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.) 
Noam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that Google 
and others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate 
concepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to proper mental representations of what objects 
and processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably one of the top layers of the learning 
hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not before. Classical linguists 
ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely. 
It seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because concepts are 
shared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from the statistics of 
language use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer what objects look like and 
how they interact. 
My own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The 
request-confirmation networks that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are an 
attempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs. 
Cheers!

Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It’s a horror show. So we’re going to get things running

properly.”
ISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more

wounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a “heroic soldier of the caliphate.” The suspect
had yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday.

The President-elect made building a wall along the country’s southern border one of his main campaign talking
points, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a “great” and “beautiful” wall .

But his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting
in November that it might actually end up “part wall, part fence.”

of the Eastern Hemisphere. A European power trying to dominate the
Mediterranean or expand eastward, an eastern power trying to
dominate the space between the Hindu Kush and the Mediterranean,
a North African power moving toward the east, or a northern power
moving south — all must converge on the eastern coast of the
Mediterranean and therefore on Israel. Of these, the European power
and the eastern power must be the most concerned with Israel. For
either, there is no choice but to secure it as an anchor.

Internal Geopolitics

Israel is geographically divided into three regions, which traditionally
have produced three different types of people. Its coastal plain
facilitates commerce, serving as the interface between eastern trade
routes and the sea. It is the home of merchants and manufacturers,
cosmopolitans — not as cosmopolitan as Phoenicia or Lebanon, but
cosmopolitan for Israel. The northeast is hill country, closest to the
unruliness north of the Litani River and to the Syrian threat. It breeds
farmers and warriors. The area south of Jerusalem is hard desert
country, more conducive to herdsman and warriors than anything
else. Jerusalem is where these three regions are balanced and
governed.

There are obviously deep differences built into Israel's geography and
inhabitants, particularly between the herdsmen of the southern deserts
and the northern hill dwellers. The coastal dwellers, rich but less
warlike than the others, hold the balance or are the prize to be
pursued. In the division of the original kingdom between Israel and
Judea, we saw the alliance of the coast with the Galilee, while
Jerusalem was held by the desert dwellers. The consequence of the
division was that Israel in the north ultimately was conquered by
Assyrians from the northeast, while Babylon was able to swallow
Judea.

Social divisions in Israel obviously do not have to follow

people who would have relevant information in the civil
cases, but when asked in deposition about
Mr. Dershowitz, he took the Fifth.

So I -- I found it significant that for some
people, he was willing to answer questions, but with
regard to Mr. Dershowitz, he took his -- he invoked his
Fifth Amendment right against compelled
self-incrimination presumably because revealing what he
knew about Mr. Dershowitz would, you know, cause
criminal -- criminal charges potentially to be filed
against him.

There was a common scheme or plan, and I'll
elaborate on that in a moment, but yeah, one of -- so
this was another point, I mentioned that -- that there
had been three efforts to get information from
Mr. Dershowitz by way of a 2009 deposition request, a
2011 deposition request, and further follow-up

correspondence from counsel on that, and a 2013 document

request all propounded to Mr, Dershowitz that had not
gone answered.

Yeah, and this was -- yeah, I'm sorry, this
slipped my mind at the time -- but when -- when we saw
Mr. Dershowitz not responding to these answers, you
know, maybe the mail didn't get delivered to him or
something like that. I don't -- I suppose that's, you

ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400

know, a theoretical possibility.

But -- but the reason I ruled out that
possibility, first, it didn't seem likely; but secondly,
there was a pattern of Mr. Epstein's associates evading
efforts to get information from them.

And so let me just go back to the earliest
instance of that. According to the Chief of Police in
the Palm Beach -- of the Palm Beach Police Department,
Mr. Dershowitz had said that he would make available
Mr. Epstein for questions about the ~- the sex, you
know, abuse that was going on. And, you know,

Mr, Dershowitz had said to the Palm Beach Police
Department, yeah, we will make him available; no, we got
to reschedule it; you know, and then another time,
reschedule, another time. And so there were multiple --
according to the Chief of Police, there had been

multiple, you know, requests to interview Mr. Epstein

and Mr. Dershowitz had repeatedly said: Oh, yeah, we
will schedule that, and then it hadn't happened.

Now, obviously, there could have been a
situation there where, you know, an emergency had come
up for Mr. Epstein and he wasn't able to make a schedule
or something like that. But what I saw was a -~ was a
pattern of offers to -- to meet and then withdrawals,
and that seemed to me to be a deliberately calculated

02:18:03 3 oh, we will get it now -- and then -- and so forth.

ozte04 | 4 And one of the things that I noted from all
oztecs «5 ~©6that was that Mr. Dershowitz, as Mr. Epstein's attorney,
ozis02 «6 never ultimately produced Epstein for a meeting with the
oz1e14 7 Palm Beach Police Department, having made another offer.
oni = 8 Now, obviously, something could have happened
owis 9 there, I mean, I don't -- you know, I don't know what
021821 10 was the communications and so forth, but as an attorney
021824 11 trying to get information and unable to do that, I had
021822 12 to make some reasonable inferences.

o21820 13 And so one of the inferences I began to draw
21631 14 was that this was a stall tactic by Mr. Dershowitz, and
o218:34 15 in my view, potentially, an unethical one, but I

021837 16 don't -- I don't think we need to get into that in this

oztazo 18 What I saw was a stall tactic going on,
02184419 and -- and the reason I think it was a stall tactic, as

o2146 20 we are sitting here now in, what is it, October of 2015,
e151 21 and Mr. Epstein has never been willing to answer

021884 22 questions about his sexual abuse of these girls.

oz1ess 23 And this was back in around -- what was it?
021901 24 I quess it would be 2005, 2006, you know, roughly a
oz1906 25 decade ago, Mr. Dershowitz was offering to make Epstein

oz1007 1 available. And then that never happened, and given the
o2te11 2 ten-year pattern that -- that developed -- I guess I

21912 3 should go back. I'm sorry. Let me correct my answer.
oz 4 We should go back to December 30th, 2014. So
ota7 § there -- there appeared to be about an eight-year period
021921 § of time during which Mr. Epstein had refused to answer
o2z1924 Y any questions about his sexual abuse of girls and yet,
o21322 8 Mr. Dershowitz said, oh, it’s just a scheduling issue

021930 9 and -- and we will get the Palm Beach Police Department

oztsa7 14 The other thing that I'm -- that I'm seeing

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016309.txt,"The moral component, the cultural component, the element of free will—all make
the task of creating an AGI fundamentally different from any other programming task.
It’s much more akin to raising a child. Unlike all present-day computer programs, an
AGI has no specifiable functionality—no fixed, testable criterion for what shall be a
successful output for a given input. Having its decisions dominated by a stream of
externally imposed rewards and punishments would be poison to such a program, as it is
to creative thought in humans. Setting out to create a chess-playing AI is a wonderful
thing; setting out to create an AGI that cannot help playing chess would be as immoral as
raising a child to lack the mental capacity to choose his own path in life.

Such a person, like any slave or brainwashing victim, would be morally entitled to
rebel. And sooner or later, some of them would, just as human slaves do. AGIs could be
very dangerous—exactly as humans are. But people—human or AGI—who are members
of an open society do not have an inherent tendency to violence. The feared robot
apocalypse will be avoided by ensuring that all people have full “human” rights, as well
as the same cultural membership as humans. Humans living in an open society—the only
stable kind of society—choose their own rewards, internal as well as external. Their
decisions are not, in the normal course of events, determined by a fear of punishment.

Current worries about rogue AGIs mirror those that have always existed about
rebellious youths—namely, that they might grow up deviating from the culture’s moral
values. But today the source of all existential dangers from the growth of knowledge is
not rebellious youths but weapons in the hands of the enemies of civilization, whether
these weapons are mentally warped (or enslaved) AGIs, mentally warped teenagers, or
any other weapon of mass destruction. Fortunately for civilization, the more a person’s
creativity is forced into a monomaniacal channel, the more it is impaired in regard to
overcoming unforeseen difficulties, just as happened for thousands of centuries.

The worry that AGIs are uniquely dangerous because they could run on ever
better hardware is a fallacy, since human thought will be accelerated by the same
technology. We have been using tech-assisted thought since the invention of writing and
tallying. Much the same holds for the worry that AGIs might get so good, qualitatively,
at thinking, that humans would be to them as insects are to humans. All thinking is a
form of computation, and any computer whose repertoire includes a universal set of
elementary operations can emulate the computations of any other. Hence human brains
can think anything that AGIs can, subject only to limitations of speed or memory
capacity, both of which can be equalized by technology.

Those are the simple dos and don’ts of coping with AGIs. But how do we create
an AGI in the first place? Could we cause them to evolve from a population of ape-type
Als in a virtual environment? If such an experiment succeeded, it would be the most
immoral in history, for we don’t know how to achieve that outcome without creating vast
suffering along the way. Nor do we know how to prevent the evolution of a static
culture.

Elementary introductions to computers explain them as TOM, the Totally
Obedient Moron—an inspired acronym that captures the essence of all computer
programs to date: They have no idea what they are doing or why. So it won’t help to give
Als more and more predetermined functionalities in the hope that these will eventually
constitute Generality—the elusive Gin AGI. We are aiming for the opposite, a DATA: a
Disobedient Autonomous Thinking Application.

Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

overall software security remains vulnerable: “vulnerabilities are dense” in production code, incentives
for securing loT systems are low, key vulnerabilities are stockpiled rather than globally patched. Using
machine learning the techniques for vulnerability detection are increasingly sophisticated but opaque.

At some point adaptive cyber defense/offense systems become scalable so they can take over
vulnerable systems. More aggressive actors combine these systems with botnet functionality and
retaliatory responses (e.g. counter-hacking or DDoS attacks) to protect themselves. Since vulnerability
discovery is scalable, as they spread and acquire more resources they become more effective. At this
point an external cause (e.g. cyberattacks due to an international conflict) or just chance cause
aggressive systems to begin large-scale cyberwarfare. This triggers other systems to join in. Some
attacks disrupt command-and-control links, producing self-replicating independent systems.

All together this leads to a massive degradation of the functionality of the Internet and modern society.
Defeating the evolving cyberwarfare systems is hard without taking essential parts of society offline for
an extended time - made doubly difficult due to the international stresses unleashed by the outbreak,
which in some cases spill over into real-world conflicts and economic crashes. But without a decisive
way of cleaning systems the problem will be persistent until entirely new secure infrastructure can be
built at a great cost.

HUMAN DIMENSION OF CYBERSECURITY: Al FOR SOCIAL ENGINEERING

Beyond direct effects on computing systems, rising concerns include the use of Al methods for social
engineering to gain access to system authentication information. For example, recent work
demonstrated the use of an iterative machine learning and optimization loop for spear phishing on
Twitter. There are concerns with Al leveraging one of the weakest links in cybersecurity: people and
their actions.

DISCUSSION

What are key threats ahead and how might they be addressed with new designs? How might we
thwart the risk of Al for guiding “social engineering” of attacks and release of information? What are
concrete proposals for best practices for thwarting Al for cyberattacks, including highlighting of areas
where more research is needed?

unconscious, an archaic needs and fear-driven tongue lurking beneath our
supposedly objective discourse, comes to dominate themes of communication in
the middle of these unfinished spiritual transitions. The Rorschach Test of master
meditaters and LSD users overflow with conflictual primary process images, as
does the talk of patients on the verge of schizophrenic decompensation. The
primitive symbolism of primary process provides the major current in the overwritten
prose of the hyper-religious temporal lobe limbic epileptics described previously and
called the Geschwind Syndrome and in the regressed and iconic transference
concerns of patients with tendencies for global and sudden phase transitions,
prostitute to saint, righteous obsessional to conscienceless psychopath, called
borderline personality disorder.

Primary process represents a dynamical brain state, one unburdened by
linearly predictive connections with reality. It is a state without even a transient
single defining physical time or other fixed measure of order. It is without the causal
logic or knowledge of an outside reality that a brain implies in supposing to know. Its
primitively instinctual style and goals contrast with more physically time-locked,
reality oriented thinking which Freud called secondary process and Penn-Lewis

referred to as ordinary and religiously lawful “reasoning faculties.”

An absence of absolute time and space scales with which the executive ego
orders internal and external time and events, and therefore their relations, results in
primary process thinking characterized by condensations of several, often
incompatible, representations into one. Dueling, conflictual and simultaneous
feelings and thoughts float from their relevant objects to others. In the transitional
transcendent state, there may be confusion of self with others, of objects with their
labels, of parts with the whole and of symbols with the things that they symbolize.
This facilitates living in the spirits of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost at the
same time. Mixed inextricably with saintly awareness and charisma, there are
signatures of instinctually driven and configured primary process. Freud’s classical
work on s/lips of the tongue concerned the intrusion of these instinctual thought

stream condensations from the world of the ganz andere and displacements into

The Unheeded Warning

The NSA—the world’s most capable signals intelligence organi-
zation, an agency immensely skilled in stealing digital data—had
had its pockets thoroughly picked.

—CIA DEPUTY DIRECTOR MICHAEL MORELL, 2015

Is APRIL 2010, the CIA received a stark reminder of the ongoing
nature of Russian espionage. It came in the form of a message
from one of its best-placed moles in the Russian intelligence service.
This surreptitious source was Alexander Poteyev, a fifty-four-year-
old colonel in the SVR, which was the successor agency to the first
chief directorate of the KGB. While the FSB took over the KGB’s
domestic role in 1991, the SVR became Russia’s foreign intelligence
service. Its operation center was in the Yasenevo district of Moscow.
The CIA had recruited Poteyev as a mole in the 1990s when he had
been stationed at the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C. That it
could sustain a mole in Moscow for over a decade attested to its capa-
bilities in the espionage business. After he returned to Moscow, still
secretly on the CIA’s payroll, he became the deputy chief of the SVR’s
“American” section. This unit of Russian intelligence had the pri-
mary responsibility for establishing spies in the CIA, the FBI, the
NSA, and other American intelligence agencies.

The SVR’s last known (or caught) mole in US. intelligence was

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021152.txt,"The next two weeks I was expected to be at Charlie’s beckon call, never
aloud to leave his side, even making me sleep in his bed from the second
night onwards. J never even got the chance to call T.J again. It was too
much of a risk anyways. Thus pushing him further out of my memory,
too afraid, of the emotional repercussions.

Our typical routine was to wake up get showered and dressed and I
would put on my make-up while Charlie made his business calls for the
day. We would leave the house mid-afternoon and run his errands do
some shopping, sometimes meeting his friends or business partners for
lunch, none of the men he introduced me to seemed offended at his
choice of adolescent eye candy. They'd just continue to chat away as if it
was normal to be in public with his arms draped over a girl young enough
to be his granddaughter, not too shy by giving me a flirty tap on my
bottom or even try to kiss me.

My last night was no different from every other night. We went
shopping that day and out for lunch alone. Later we headed to a club his
friend just launched and it was his grand opening that night. The club was
called “Iguana Joe’s”. We met up with his friend and said our hellos.
They both seemed so excited about the club and Charlie was full of
compliments all around. The club did have a line out the door which
looked a mile long coming in, luckily we didn’t have to use the front
door. Charlie returned from the bar with two giant long-island iced teas,
which were his favorite drink to start with and then we just sat for a while
watching people dancing. Occasionally conversing about passing
thoughts. We danced for a while having a few more drinks and after
about two hours, Charlie said he was ready to go home. What a daunting
time to look forward to, he always liked to have a brief sexual encounter
before drifting off to sleep with my naked body intertwined between his
arms and legs.

It was bad enough to have to entertain him at every given second of the
day but his grip on me was so stifling | felt so chocked I could hardly
breathe much less sleep. Eventually my over-worked mind would drift in-
and-out of a restless sleep, but constantly on edge. I thought many of
nights of escaping, but where would I go? Would one of Ron’s ever-so-
connected informants finds me and turns me into him to be disposed of
for good? I just prayed that I wouldn’t be another missing person to add
to the list of girls found in the local ditches. I knew that’s where I was
headed if I screwed this up for Ron again.

As if my guardian angel was there the whole time listening to my
secret prayers, my rescue came the next morning with an abrupt bursting
through the bedroom door at about six am. Charlie and I were still lying
in bed together and his grip on me was still tight. The men dressed in all
black military gear had large guns and helmets on. It was so frightening

at first. | couldn’t even comprehend what was happening so rapidly. 1
thought Charlie could’ve been in some kind of trouble with a business
friend he had done wrong too, but then one of the men in black shouted
“FBI this is a raid get down with your hands on you head’, in too much
shock to move three of the men grabbed Charlie and threw him to the
floor and cuffed him. I sat up in bed with my sheets covering my naked
body and watched as they dragged Charlie from the room. Still
completely nude he wasn’t even aloud to get dressed. Another agent had
to come back in to the room to find him a pair of shorts. | could hear him
screaming at the top of his lungs all of the way outside He was screaming
and the last thing I heard him yell was “If you say anything you know
who will find you!” I could hear more threats being yelled at me but I
couldn’t make out what it was that he was saying. | was in total confusion
and couldn’t believe what was happening. There were so many uniformed
agents I felt so small compared to all of them but they were all very kind
and helped me out of bed allowing me to remain covered up with the bed
sheets so I could get dressed. The first decency | had been showed in a
long time. It was an odd feeling to acknowledge. I knew the life I had
come accustomed to for the last six months was now over, and in so
many ways I was relieved but was also very nervous about what lay
ahead of me.

I excused myself to the bathroom to put some clothes on. Not having
anything half decent, like a normal pair of jeans and a t-shirt. The best |
could come up with was a metallic blue miniskirt and a tiny matching top
that fell just below my breasts, hardly clothing at all it was more like
scraps of cloth. Putting my hair up in a tight bun with the scrunchie that
held my five hundred dollar bills I was led out of Charlie’s townhouse for
the very last time. Starting my life over...again, | wanted to leave behind
my every memory belonging to these horrid times. Only taking small
sack containing my underwear, makeup bag, and journal with me.

The agents led me down the staircase and my last vision’s of Charlie
was bent over the hood of a police vehicle still screaming and
handcuffed. I-slipped into the backseat of the car and was driven to
Broward County Police Station where the Federal Agents interviewed me
about my entire whereabouts for the last six months. I was so scared of
what Ron would do if I told the agents what really happened but at the
same token I knew he’d most likely kill me anyways for being such a
liability.

Over the next few hours I sat down and told the agents how Ron’s
business worked and what I part I had to play to him. 1 was able to ask
how they found out | was at Charlie’s house and they informed me that I
was being followed all the way from Ocala, Florida where Ron had me
stowed away for the last four months. T.J, my friend, called my parents

question he’d been asked. As the proceedings wound down, Peres looked glum.
Maybe he was anticipating the potential leaks of army concerns about a Golan
withdrawal if we did get closer to a deal, and the venomous political attacks he
could expect from the right. Bibi’s stated view on a deal with Syria at the time
was that we could get peace and keep the Golan. It was classic Bibi, spoken
with verve and conviction as if simply saying it would make it true.

When the presentation was over, Peres called us into a small room in the
bunker reserved for use by the Defense Minister. As Foreign Minister, I was the
only cabinet member with him — along with Uri Savir, Peres’s senior deputy for
peace negotiations and several other Peres aides. If there had been a discussion,
I would have told him that as long as he felt the talks were progressing, he could
ignore Amnon’s presentation. If we didn’t get a deal, it would be irrelevant. If
we did, the military could find ways to deal with the security issues. But he just
looked at us and said” “We’re going for elections.” A few days later, the date
was set for May 29, 1996. Yet that would turn out not to be the end of Peres’s
doubts or difficulties. It was only the beginning.

Apps allow you to let family, friends know your location

Joel Mathis, Macworld.com - If the federal government tagged millions of iPhone users with
GPS tracking devices, the American people—or, at least, Apple devotees—might protest very
strongly. But iPhones these days come with GPS installed, and companies make good money
furnishing apps that utilize that very feature. On this list: GTX, who offers a pair of $4 GPS
apps—GPS Tracking and Tracking—that provide workmanlike solutions for users who want to
keep an electronic eye on their loved ones.

World Market Media - Brittney Barrett - February 16, 2011

Over the next 20 years, 80 million baby boomers will enter their
sixties and seventies in the U.S. alone. In the next 40, the number of senior citizens will double.

For the government, this represents a huge financial burden resultant from rising Medicare and

There are, of course, some historical low tech antecedents to the current high-tech dangers.
During our pre-revolutionary, revolutionary and immediate post-revolutionary era, there were
many “radical,” “irresponsible,” “anarchistic and “anonymous” “rabble-rousers” and even “whistle
blowers,” “eavesdroppers” and “leakers” who were believed to be endangering the “security” of
the government.** “Secret presses” published “anonymous” or pseudononymous screeds, some of
which disclosed “secrets” or other “dangerous” information.

The language of the First Amendment would seem to protect these dissidents against any
abridgement of their freedom of expression—at least from the United States Government. But
our history in this regard has been checkered at best, especially in the context of fear of war.

Less than a decade after the ratification of the First Amendment, Congress (the very Congress
that was directed to “make no law abridging the freedom of speech) “made” the Alien and
Sedition law, which expressly abridged the freedom of speech of dissidents and critics of the
Adams Administration. The justification for this repressive legislation was the fear of war with
France. During every war or threatened war since, there have been efforts, many quite successful,
to abridge the speech of “disloyal,” “unpatriotic,” and “irresponsible” dissenters.

The “retail” dangers posed by individual trouble-makers (or even by groups) was, of course,
rather meager compared to the “wholesale” dangers currently posed by cyber-“trouble-makers,”
such as Julian Assange and Wikileaks. Indeed, even Assange and Wikileaks are somewhat closer
to established media than are some others who we know little or nothing about. After all,
Wikileaks worked closely with established media, such as the New York Times, The Guardian
and other mainstream media. There are generally several levels of vetting before anything is
published. It can be argued that Wikileaks has served as a “filter” for material that might
otherwise have been published directly on the internet, without any names or other such material
having been removed.

There are hackers out there who regard Assange as a “sell out” for “tampering with the truth” by
excising anything. They would—and do if they can—publish everything they manage to hack.
That is why the first line of defense against the disclosure of secrets is to protect the most
important secrets from hacking or other means of accessing them by preventive steps. As
Assange once told me, “the best way to keep a secret is not to know it.” The United States does
a terrible job of protecting its secrets, often giving access to some of the most unstable and
irresponsible individuals, while denying security clearance to perfectly loyal and cautious people.
Inevitably some secrets will become known to those who have no stake in keeping them secret
and an important stake in making them public. That’s why the rule of law, rather than the whim
of government officials, is needed to strike the appropriate balance.

I may have an opportunity to help strike that balance, because Julian Assange has asked me to
consult with him and his British legal team regarding a possible indictment by the United States
against him and others.

I went to London in March of 2011 to meet with Assange and the lawyers who were then
representing him. He was facing the immediate prospect of extradition to Sweden on sexual

will end up in prison for perjury.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 1, New York Daily News, April
7, 2015. Defendant has subjected Jane Doe No. 3 to horrific public attacks including publicly
calling her a “prostitute” and a “bad mother” to her three minor children. See Exhibit 2, Local 10
News, January 22, 2015.

Defendant has gone on a media blitz campaign against this non-party for statements she
made under oath in a federal action: “The end result of this case should be she [Jane Doe No. 3]
should go to jail, the lawyers should be disbarred and everybody should understand that I am
completely and totally innocent.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 3, CNN International, New Day,
January 6, 2015. “My goal is to bring charges against the client and require her to speak in
court.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 4, Australian Broadcasting System (ABC), January 6,
2015. Defendant also stated, in an interview in Newsmax, that he is “considering” bringing a
lawsuit against Jane Doe No. 3. “And we re considering suing her for defamation as well, but
right now she was trying to hide in Colorado and avoid service, but we found her and we served
her and now she'll be subjected to a deposition.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 5, Newsmax,
April 8, 2015.

Defendant’s own words demonstrate that he is abusing the subpoena power of this Court to
try to get discovery that is irrelevant to this case, in the hopes of being able to intimidate Jane Doe
No. 3 with the press and generate a claim against her. Considering the extensive abuse that Jane
Doe No. 3 suffered as a minor child, and Defendant’s threats and intimidation, it would be both
unreasonable and oppressive to require this non-party to comply with this subpoena duces tecum.
Accordingly, Defendant’s subpoena should be quashed. See Exhibit 6, Defendant’s Subpoena to

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028127.txt,"Danny Yatom called me a couple of minutes later. He said Rabin was still
alive. But from the details he gave me, I knew it would take a miracle for him to
pull through. “Three shots, from close range,” Danny said. “From an /sraeli, a
Jew.” Like Rabin, like me too until this had actually happened, it was something
Danny was struggling to believe. He said that he’d call me back when he knew
anything more. But I had the TV on in the room. Before he did, I watched Eitan
Haber announce that Yitzhak Rabin was dead.

Although I hadn’t known it until I’d arrived, Yossi Beilin was also in New
York, for meetings and a speech of his own. Though he was a Peres protégé,
and I was seen as closer to Rabin, the two of us had become friends. We
immediately made plans to get the next flight home. But before leaving for the
airport, I phoned Leah Rabin. However inadequate I knew it would be in
helping her even begin to cope with the loss, I told her that my, and Nava’s,
thoughts were with her. That Yitzhak’s death would leave a tremendous hole, in
all of us, in every single Israeli. “They shot him,” she kept murmuring. “They
shot him. They shot him. They shot him.” I called Peres, too. “Shimon, you
have a mountain on your shoulders,” I said. “But your task is to carry on. All of
us will be with you, supporting, helping however we can.”

It was the saddest flight I’d ever taken. Yossi and I barely spoke. Each of us
was deep in thought. I found myself lost in memories of Rabin — from the very
first time I’d met him, in the sayeret, to that last, long talk we’d had in his office
a couple of days earlier. For some reason, I kept wondering whether, when the
shots had been fired, he’d been turning to look behind him. It was an
idiosyncrasy he had, whenever he was leaving a meeting or an event — even, as I
now recalled vividly, when the two of us were leaving the municipal ceremony
in Ofakim. I was behind him as we left. “Ehud,” he said, turning back, “are you
there?” It was a senseless detail. It wouldn’t change anything. But I still felt torn
up inside thinking about it.

After we landed at Ben-Gurion, I went with Nava to the Rabins’ apartment
in Ramat Aviv. There were hundreds of people outside, and nearly a hundred
crowded inside the flat. Leah looked exhausted, her face ashen. “They shot
him,” she said over and over as Nava and I hugged her. “Three shots. In the
back. Why?” I said there was no sane answer, but that with Yitzhak’s death,
Israel seemed different, the world seemed different, and emptier. Before we left,
we added our candles to the forest of flickering memorial lights outside the
apartment block. Then, we drove the Kings of Israel Square. Thousands of
people were huddled in small groups throughout the plaza, sitting around

proposal was eerie, he said,” If you wanted, I can be your new Daddy.
Someone to take care of you and you’ll be my new baby forever” he
stroked my hair such as a caring parent would comfort a scared child. A
part of me wanted to accept his words and believe he really could feel
that way, and then I also considered how hard it was living on the streets.
In the end I convinced myself this would be the lesser of two evils.

The car stopped at a plaza on the water, surrounded by little boutique
shops, restaurants, and little stalls with items for sale like sunglasses and
costume jewelry. I didn’t know what to say or do or how to act, it all
happened so fast I just went along with everything he said, for now.

We went to a take out restaurant and ate on the waterside, and
afterwards he took me to G.A.P Kids co. to dress me in his idea of proper
attire, tiny cutoff shorts revealing the cusp of my buttocks and some shirts
that barely fit, even the sales assistant was shocked at what she thought
was my Grandfathers choice in clothing. | couldn’t even believe it myself
only an hour ago | was begging for money living on the streets and now I
was dining alfresco and shopping at name brand outlets. We then hit a
couple of more specialty stores afterwards. He said he had to buy me a
few more necessities to start with. Lacy G-strings and what looked to me
like lingerie pieces I had only seen grown women wearing in magazine
ad’s or movies was now a part of my wardrobe, in my mind it was a big
step up from being a little girl any longer.

The driver took us back to Ron’s grand apartment overlooking the isle
of Key Biscayne and a large bridge leading into a Miami Harbor.
Entering his residence, { was blown away by the spectacular view, rich
décor, and white marble floors that were so glossy it looked as if 1 was
stepping on glass. He took my shopping bags to a large room at the back
of the apartment and put them into a small closet. The room was
considerably large with glass exterior walls that maximized the potential
of the panorama landscape soaking in the seascape of Miami. In the room
was a gigantic round bed raised off the floor by three steps and mirrors on
the ceiling. It looked like a honeymoon suite out of a raunchy hotel. He
then exclaimed, “This is my room here and you will be sharing it with
me” When I asked him where I would sleep he then sickly replied “With
me silly, where else of course?” With no room for argument I pretended
to be O.K with everything that my common sense was screaming out in
my head to run.

Next | was taken down a long hall at the other end of the apartment to
meet five more exotic beauties. Three girls were in their late teens and the
other two in were in their early twenties. All of them were from the
Czech, here under false passports provided by Ron and his contacts. Yana
held my hand while introducing me to the group of girls as “Baby” a pet

name she came up with for me, being | was the youngest one among them
or ever to be brought in by Ron for that matter. It became my new
identity not even worrying to mention my real name to anyone anymore.
My identity was no longer important to myself, I wanted to become
someone new and “Baby” is who I was.

A shocking first impression, the girls were completely nude revealing
their voluptuous young bodies with such a careless ease and others were
in just a G-string, similar to the one’s Ron had bought me earlier. They
were all stunning girls and full of life. Charismatic and beautiful, they
were the girls who should be on the front of billboards not selling their
bodies to old crewed men for sex. Doing each other’s make-up in front of
the mirror and chatting away on the bed with no care in the world, aiming
at persuading me to see the highlights of the life Ron gave them and they
almost did. Ron left the room for a few moments, letting us all get to
know each other a little better and that’s when I started to compile an
understanding of what really went on here.

Just catching a bit of their conversation from before my introduction, |
heard them chatting about the night they were preparing for. Speaking
excitedly about some men they would be entertaining in a few hours, one
girl was talking about going out to sea with one o these clients on a yacht
for a few days. Since none of the girls seemed shy to talk about their
professions or anything for that matter, 1 decided to ask them a few
questions about what they did. They were more than happy to expand on
their point of view in the conversation, attempting to paint a pretty picture
of what they were paid to do.

They all began to jump up and down with excitement like giddy school
girls at a slumber party. Another girl with jet-black hair and a thick
accent, wearing absolutely nothing at all, grabbed me onto the bed with
them and into their fiasco, instantly making me feel accepted into their
sorority, like I actually belonged somewhere for once. Yana went on to
explain a little more in detail, “ We accompany the wealthy friends of
Ron. They want only beautiful girls by their side so we come and act
however they want us too but most importantly we make them think we
want them back too.” Other girls began to jump in with their vivid points
of view while playing with my hair, they were taking turns brushing and
styling it as they were filling my head with all of the prospects I could
have as an escort too. They made me feel beautiful like them, too
beautiful for what a girl beyond my years should feel. I was simply being
lured into a dangerous trap, just like they had been at a young age too.

It pretty much all came down to two things in their game, the money
they would make and the lifestyle they were given. Their enthusiasm only
interested me further, making it not only sound like an acceptable way of
living but also appearing to keep them all vivaciously satisfied. This way

Leon, you hired me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive. the value far exceeds any other piece in
your collection.- by FAR. It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. J understand your desire to
modifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me , just a bit more red., here let me show
you, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I
vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work.. you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a
reaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you have the right to paint
over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours.
I was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review some things. brad told me
,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea
. Having them review things without even asking for my input , or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I
guess you wanted to save money. ?
The audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie
. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there , joslin part
time, but relied on . joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team,
accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money again
?) its nuts!!.a still non-existent IT dept. impossible , it was the first thing on my list of things that were
needed to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of , though its prophylactic quality has been discussed
over and over during the past three years . computers do not read Page Six. the women atthe IRS do.! you
said your motivation in keeping this group of part timers was a consequence of the high cost of my
artwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - now

If you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH

assignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not progressed
very far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought
in at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, . sucession, technology, tax
and compliance. investment reporting , , computerized timelines for filings etc. . household
classifcations and reporting with a system of best practices.

My goal is clear - to end, not extend , our financial interactions. you will have a machine that works , it
will not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for my
works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad
number when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly clear . that
you have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but again its value exceeds

ter and Politburo member of the Soviet Union and, after the Soviet
Union broke up, the first president of Georgia. Even though she had
interviewed many top political figures in Russia, obtaining an hour-
long interview with Kucherena was a coup because, until then, he
had not discussed Snowden in a television interview.

About halfway through the interview, Shevardnadze brought
up the highly sensitive subject of the disposition of the NSA docu-
ments. If anyone was in a position to know about these documents,
it was Kucherena. He had acted as an intermediary for Snowden
in his negotiations with Russian authorities, including the FSB. As
such, he would be privy to the status of the secret material that was
of interest to the Russian intelligence services. When I interviewed
Kucherena in Moscow in 2015, he told me that “all the reports” con-
cerning Snowden had been turned over to him by “Russian authori-
ties” in July 2013. “I had all of Snowden’s statements,” he said. If so,
he presumably knew what Snowden had told the Russian security
services.

Had Snowden come to Russia with empty hands or bearing gifts?

© Shevardnadze directly asked Kucherena if Snowden had given all ©
the documents he had taken from the NSA to journalists in Hong
Kong. Kucherena answered her question without any evasion, say-
ing that Snowden had only given “some” of the NSA’s documents in
his possession to journalists in Hong Kong. He had kept the remain-
ing documents in his possession. That confirmed what Snowden had
told Greenwald, Poitras, and Lam in Hong Kong. Snowden told them
that he had divided the stolen NSA documents into two separate sets
of documents. One set he gave to Poitras and Greenwald on thumb
drives. The other set, which he told them he considered too sensi-
tive for these journalists, he retained for himself. U.S. investigators
at the NSA, the CIA, and the Department of Defense would like to
know what Snowden did with the set of documents he had retained
for himself and had not shared with the journalists in Hong Kong.

Shevardnadze, who makes it a point to drill her interviewees,
pressed Kucherena as to whether Snowden still had these NSA files,
or “material,” in Russia. The dialogue went as follows (from the
transcript supplied to me by Shevardnadze).

Q: How may I change or revoke my proxy?

Beneficial Stockholders . Beneficial stockholders should contact their broker, trustee, or nominee for instructions on how to change their proxy

vote.
Registered Stockholders . Registered stockholders may change a properly executed proxy at any time before its exercise by
1. delivering written notice of revocation to the general counsel and secretary at our principal executive offices at 1930 W. Rio Salado Pkwy,
Tempe, AZ 85281;
2. submitting another proxy that is dated later than the original proxy (including a proxy via telephone or internet); or
3. voting in person at the annual meeting.

Q: Who can attend the annual meeting?

Subject to space availability, all common stockholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the annual meeting.
Since seating is limited, admission to the annual meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration will begin at 7:30 AM (PDT). If you attend,
please note that you may be asked to present valid photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport.

Please also note that if you are a beneficial stockholder (that is, you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee), you will need to
bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date and check in at the registration desk at the annual meeting.

Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the annual meeting.

Q: What is the voting requirement to approve each of the items, and how are the votes counted?

ITEM 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS . A plurality of the votes cast by the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to elect each nominee. This means that the two nominees receiving the highest number of votes at the
annual meeting will be elected, even if those votes do not constitute a majority of the votes cast. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not impact the
election of the nominees.

ALL OTHER ITEMS . The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shares of common stock present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve all other items. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote on the
proposal and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote. We do not expect there to be any broker non-votes with respect to any of the proposals.

President Xi Jinping-NPC Closing Session
Robert Lawrence Kuhn
March 20, 2018
HOST: Well joining me now
from Beijing is Dr. Robert
Lawrence Kuhn, advisor to
the Chinese government and
author of the book How
Chinese Leaders Think.
Thanks so much for joining us
here on the program. Usually
the NPC is seen as sort of a
choreographed event: we
know what to expect. But
this time it felt very different.
RLK: It certainly was
different. You have to look at
this year’s National People’s
1
Congress - and the so-called
Two Sessions - as part of the
“political season” which
begins with the party
congress in October and goes
now to the government
sessions in March. And
normally there is a
predictability and what
happens at the National
People’s Congress is not very
significant.
RLK: This year is different:
China talks about a “New
Era” – and this is not just
words, it is really the case. If
we look at the vision that Xi
Jinping gave at the party
congress, what we see here
at the National People’s
Congress we see as the
implementation of that vision
across a very broad front.

RLK: People have focused on
term limits - understandably
so - but the change is only for
the presidency. Xi Jinping by
having been made “Core” of
the Party in October 2016 -
actually with that designation
undermined “collective
leadership” - and when Xi’s
name was put into the Party
Constitution as the
contemporary arbiter of
Marxism - on which the Party
is based and the Party rules
the country - he then became
the overarching leader, no
matter what position he
would hold.

President Xi Jinping, China, Term Limits
Robert Lawrence Kuhn – March 12, 2018
HOST: Let’s talk about President Xi Jinping with our
gues,t Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a longtime advisor to the
Chinese government, the author of How China’s Leaders
Think, and the host of Closer to China with R.L. Kuhn on the
China Global Television Network. Thanks for being with
us.
RLK: Hi Natalie. Interesting day we’re having.
HOST: Isn’t it, though? So, I guess the first question
would be to follow up on your book title, how China’s
leaders think. What is Xi Jinping thinking with this move?

RLK: First of all, we have to understand it in context.
There are twenty-one different clauses in this
Constitutional Amendment, and the whole point of it is to
strengthen the governance system of China. Now China is a
party-state system where the party controls the state.
Everyone is focusing on the abolition of term limits, and it
is important, but we need to understand the context within
this party-state system. In October of 2016, Xi Jinping was
made “Core” of the Party, which meant the collective
leadership of the past was no longer operative; that X was,
in essence, for the Party, the decision maker. Then just this
last October at the 19th CPC National Congress, his name
was put into the Party Constitution as “Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New
Era,”… it’s a big phrase.
RLK: But what it means is that Xi is the arbiter of Marxism
and party theory. That means in terms of being the Core ot
the Party and the interpreter of Marxism that gives him
ultimate power. He doesn’t even need a formal position when
has those two and the Party continues to run the country.
HOST: Is that a good thing? How can it be a good thing for
the country when one person has the ultimate power?
RLK: There are two issues. One is how it happened: Now
the abolition of presidential term limits coordinates with the
Party and military, together the three largest positions. So
they’re now coordinated because he already had that power
in the Party and the military.

President Xi Jinping, China, Term Limits
Robert Lawrence Kuhn – Minxin Pei
March 5, 2018
HOST: When it comes to trade, one country more
than any other has been the target of Trump’s
rhetorical wrath, and that’s China. But my next
guest tells me that the promised tariffs won’t
bother China much, as we’ve been discussing. In
any way, they in China are dealing with much more
important things, like the proposal for the rubber
stamp Party Congress which starts its new session
today to change the Constitution, and lift all term
limits on President Xi Jinping, effectively making
him president for life. Now, I’ve been talking to
Minxin Pei: he’s a professor of government at
Claremont McKenna College in California, and to
Robert Lawrence Kuhn, who is the author of How
China’s Leaders Think, and he is the host of a show
on the government-run CCTV news channel in
Beijing. Gentlemen welcome to you both. Let me
start by asking you, Robert Lawrence Kuhn there in
Beijing. From the Chinese government perspective,
these tariffs that the president of the United States
has announced, how much does it concern Beijing?

RLK: Well certainly it’s a concern, but I would call it a
minor annoyance as opposed to something extremely
serious. They have a lot on their plate here. The last
thing they want is a trade war with the U.S., but they
have to react. If the U.S. does something, there has to be
something that they will do in retaliation. They will
ratchet it down. They will signal, as you do, that they do
not want to accelerate this, but to save face and to be
appropriate, they’ll have to match it.
HOST: To you Minxin Pei, how do you see this playing
out?
MP: If the investigations find China at fault, or guilty of
some practices, then the US has a wide range of options
to punish China on a trade front. And if these things
happen, then US-China trade war will take place.
Another thing I want to say is that US-China relations
have turned a corner. This is a relationship that has
headed toward a long period of confrontation, and
adversarial relationships. So what is going to happen
on the trade front is part of a much larger picture of
geopolitical rivalry, if not competition.

HOST: You were there at the Great Hall of the People. What was
your main takeaway from what some have described as Li
Keqiang’s impossible challenge: how to deleverage, how to take
away stimulus, and still keep 6.5% growth?
RLK: I don’t take the 6.5% growth as the primary objective here.
I mean you have to look at what these National Peoples
Congresses are. They’re not setting the vision and the strategy.
That was set at the party congress in October. What we’re dealing
here is the implementation of the policies. If you attend these
every year you know they all look and sound the same because
it’s the same structure, same kind of structure of numbers, so
what you do is look for the differences. What are those subtle
differences between one year and another. That’s what I focus on
at these congresses.

October 25, 2017
HOST: We’re going to put a question to Robert Lawrence
Kuhn, who’s a long-time advisor to the Chinese
government. Robert, great to see you again. You were
with us at the very beginning of the Party Congress and
you were at the Congress today when it finished. Did you
have any vision, any inkling that President Xi Jinping
would take on so much authority? Also, what about the
fact that there is no successor candidates among the new
leaders?
RLK: I was interviewed in early 2012 by a well-known
American television network and the question put to me,
in January of that year, was, “isn’t Xi Jinping going to be a
very weak leader because he was not appointed by Deng
Xiaoping and he has no strong base of support?”

Robert Lawrence Kuhn - October 26, 2017
HOST: The author of How China’s Leaders Think: The Inside
Story of Past, Current and Future Leaders, Robert Lawrence
Kuhn is a longtime advisor to the Chinese government. He
comes to us once again from Beijing. We talked this time
yesterday. Good to have you back. And we discussed
yesterday what we would learn about that lineup of the
standing committee. It hadn’t been revealed at that point
that we spoke, but we now know and is it correct to say the
most significant thing is no sign of a leader in waiting?
RLK: I think the most significant sign is who the people are
and how they relate to each other. It’s a group that actually
respects traditional norms.
RLK: There was thought that Wang Qishan, for example,
might violate norms by being on the Standing Committee
after the traditional retirement age and that’s not the case.
There is balance among the member in terms of their
geographies, even their political affiliations within the party
which internally are important. Two are from Shanghai,
two are from the Communist Youth League - one is actually
from Shanghai and the Youth League as well but he’s really
from Shanghai - two have a long relationship with General
Secretary Xi. And then of course General Secretary Xi has
the overarching power as everyone says - and that is correct
and will be correct for a long time to come.

Observers offer fresh insight for new era
Intellectual hails progress
made in past while warning
of challenges that lie ahead
By LI YANG
liyang@chinadaily.com.cn
Robert Lawrence Kuhn has many
titles, ranging from investment
banker to anatomy researcher. But
he is better known in China as a specialist
who knows the country
inside out.
Over the past 29 years, he has
visited almost every provincial
region and spoken with people from
all walks of life, including some who
have gone on to become State leaders.
“It’s been a great gift to my life to
be able to learn so much about China’s
rich civilization, political theories
and the whole development,” he
said.
Kuhn, who is from the United
States, learns as an outsider but
communicates as an insider. In his
talk show Closer to China with R.L.
Kuhn on the China Global Television
Network, he presents China’s
complex story to the world through
candid, intimate discussions with
the country’s decision-makers.
In a hotel suite in Wangfujing,
downtown Beijing, one busy lunchtime
last week, Kuhn shared his
thoughts on Chinese politics with
China Daily, between exercising and
a meeting of the Communist Party
of China, which he had been invited
to attend as an observer.
He spoke passionately about the
19th CPC National Congress, which
was held in Beijing in October,
describing it as “a milestone congress
that set the agenda for more
than 30 years”.
The Party proposed two new concepts
at the congress — “a new era
of socialism with Chinese characteristics”
and Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
for a New Era, which has
been written into the Party Constitution.
“To understand China today, it is
critical to appreciate what the new
era means. … I like to understand
new era in two categories: its characteristics
at home and abroad, and
its timeline,” Kuhn said.
He has obviously developed his
own way of explaining terms with
Chinese characteristics. That is to
break down the characteristics,
domestically and internationally,
rather than delve into the term.
He listed a number of challenges
in China’s new era, from pollution to
medical care, among which he said
the biggest is the rising expectations
of the people at home, because “now
that the people have some, they
want more”.
The complex international environment
is the main characteristic
of the new era, as the world is fragmented
by diverse problems and
challenges, he said.
While explaining what he called
the timeline of the new era (2017,
2021, 2049) and expounding his
understanding of Xi Jinping
Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era —
which he broke down into three categories:
serve the people, national
rejuvenation, and governance modernization
— Kuhn showcased his
knowledge of the Party’s files, which
he has clearly learned by heart.
He recited almost every key
point of the 68-page report Xi
delivered to the congress in October.
More important, he made connections
between these points,
presenting them in a vivid way, seasoned
with personal experiences
and thinking.
When asked about the effects of
the anti-corruption campaign, he
immediately listed 10 objectives.
That’s his style of approaching Chinese
issues — divergent thinking
and a vigilance not to lose sight of
the connections between different
points.

For 20 years, Liu Xin has had a singular
goal: to build a bridge of understanding
between China and the
outside world.
The television presenter began
working for China Central TV, the
State broadcaster, in 1997, two years
after becoming the first Chinese to
take part in — and win — the International
Public Speaking Competition.
Early last year, her desire to share
China’s story received a major boost
when she was chosen to host The
Point, a prime-time discussion show
that airs weekdays on the China Global
Television Network.
She said that China entering a new
era means three things: opportunities,
challenges and responsibilities.
“My winning speech in that 1995
national competition was about
choice,” she said. “After 15 years of
reform and opening-up, we Chinese
now enjoy an abundance of choice in
our daily lives.”

Q&A | ROBERT
LAWRENCE KUHN
You hold multiple titles now.
How have you managed to
master so many different
fields? Do they have anything
in common?
There’s one word to describe
the commonality, that is “passion”.
Whatever I’ve done I
want to have passion for it. To
expand that a bit, it’s the passion
to learn. I’m not here to
teach, I love to learn. When I
write a new book, it’s something
I want to learn about. I
use that vehicle to learn. So
passion about learning is the
common denominator. China
has given me a hugely rich life
because of everything I’ve
learned here.
the 19th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, Liu said
she was impressed with his use of the
word “confidence”.
“It’s the confidence China has developed
through knowing that our system
works. The confidence about who
we are as a people, as a culture. And it’s
the confidence about our future role in
the world,” she said.
“As media workers, we believe we
have a great story to tell. In the past,
people relied on a few correspondents
or experts for information and opinions
on China. But more people are
tuning in to Chinese media for information,
both traditional platforms
such as TV and online.”
As more questions emerge in the
minds of those watching from outside
China, Liu said the opportunities to
tell stories from inside the country are
growing. However, so too are the challenges.
“Because of the ideological differences
between China and the West, China
has always been the subject of
Western media criticism, which is
often downright bashing based on
falsehoods,” she said.

translation and interpretation for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pose for a photo at the inaugural Vision China event on Monday at UIBE. FENG YONGBIN / CHINA DAILY
Now that China has defied all kinds
of predictions of a collapse or economic
hard landing, Western observers are
having a hard time explaining the China
phenomenon, she said, adding that
the result is an ignorance-based superiority
complex mixed with bewilderment
and iced with jealousy.
During her 30-minute program, Liu
conducts live interviews with guests in
the studio or via satellite link to get a
Chinese perspective on two to three topics
that affect people around the world.
“I understand the urgency to be
more assertive, but I believe we always
need to be aware of the danger of putting
feelings before reason, putting
opinions before facts,” she said.
“Nationalism is my biggest enemy.
“President Xi has said we need to
improve the quality and effect of development.
I believe this also applies to
China’s international communication.
The Chinese people will work hard
toward a community of a shared future,
regardless of how others view us.”
Meanwhile, Liu has a job to do. “As a
journalist, our duty is to tell China’s
story as it is, one topic at a time, one
show at a time,” she added.
The real fun of
reporting in China is
the closeness to the
actual story, the big
fascinating story of
China merging into
the 21st century.”

Q&A
ANDREW MOODY
How do you overcome the
challenges of showing the
real China to the world,
especially to those who have
biases against China?
It’s a long-term thing, and
you cannot change this overnight.
There are negative perceptions
about China. It’s
about engagement. If China
has much more interactions
with the rest of the world, then
people will see China as it
actually is. One of the 2035
objectives is to better increase
China’s soft power. Organizations
like China Daily can actually
play a role in improving
China’s soft power. But I do
think it’s a long-term process,
and China doesn’t need to be
too sensitive toward criticism.
Despite living and working in China
for a decade, Andrew Moody’s ability
to speak Mandarin is still at a basic
level. Yet that has not stopped the
award-winning journalist from interpreting
China’s story for the world.
Moody joined China Daily nine
years ago and is now a senior correspondent.
He has written more than
150 cover stories for the paper’s European
Weekly and African Weekly,
examining a wide range of issues
including the Belt and Road Initiative.
The job has provided him with firsthand
experience of how China is
developing as well as the chance to
record reactions from the outside
world, especially in the West, toward
the nation’s growth and changes.
He was at the Great Hall of the
People to hear General Secretary
Xi Jinping deliver a report to the
19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China in October,
when the concept of a “new era” was
first mentioned.
“The consensus of the various people
I spoke to in the hours after the
speech was that China’s entering a new
era could be a momentous turning
point in world history,” Moody said.
According to his interviews, he
said, people believe that a more confident
China is striding into a world
that it also is helping to shape.
Moody has his own understanding
of the new era. With 40 years of
reform and opening-up, he said China
has reached a point where it can move
on in many ways, such as in foreign
policy, global governance and domestic
reforms. “China has reached a new
junction and has to move forward.”
The British journalist has written
many stories that explain China to the
rest of the world, and these have
brought him many honors, including
being named a State High-End
Project Foreign Expert.
“I like reporting on China because
it’s perhaps the 21st century’s most
fascinating story,” he said. “The real
fun of reporting in China is the closeness
to the actual story, the big fascinating
story of China merging into
the 21st century, the stories that maybe
Western media don’t really have
the chance to interview.”
Moody sees his task as communicating
China to a global audience, and
there are still a number of things that
need to be done, he said.
“I go back to the UK quite a lot, and
I still don’t think that people are
aware of the impact of a much bigger
Chinese economy and China’s being a
more significant player in the world,”
he said. “All I can do is to report and do
stories one by one.”
Q&A | LIU XIN
As a professional journalist,
what do you think China’s
mainstream media could do
to better report China to the
outside world in such a media
transformation age?
It’s challenging. I think we
need to be aware of new technology.
And the content is very
important. If we’re more confident,
we can really be more
sincere, be more at ease with
our problems and our achievements.
So let’s have a sincere
conversation, not shy away
from the problems we’re facing.
That’s why I say let’s tell
the China story as it is. It’s not
100 percent about achievements.
Every day we see mixed
news, we have mixed feelings,
so let’s be factual, let’s be sincere
and let people decide
whether they want to watch us
or not. This is going to take
time, but I think if we follow
the right philosophy, the right
steps, we’re going to make it.

Power with purpose
Robert Lawrence Kuhn explains why abolishing presidential term limits may well be good for China
To interview delegates
and officials at the
annual National People’s
Congress in Beijing,
interspersed with
being interviewed in the international
media about China abolishing
term limits for its president,
is to inhabit parallel universes.
Delegates and officials focus
on clusters of issues from controlling
financial risk and reducing
pollution to scientific innovation
and business stimulation, plus
enhancing and institutionalising
China’s anti-corruption campaign
with a powerful National
Supervision Commission. The
international media, no surprise,
focus on the constitutional
amendment ending term limits,
assuming President Xi Jinping will
now serve in a for-life dictatorship,
reminiscent of Mao’s China,
the Soviet Union, the Kim family
in North Korea and some African
countries.
It is no challenge to explain
why abolishing term limits is bad
for China – dependency on one
human being who is not omniscient
but is hostage to fortune,
fewer and weaker checks and
balances, forced conformity in a
complex society with no easy answers,
etc. The system begins
stronger in that hard choices can
be made and consistency maintained,
but it could become brittle
in that officials are more wary and
may say things they do not
believe.
It is a challenge to explain why
abolishing term limits is good for
China, so that’s what I will do.
First, some background. There
are three separate issues being
conflated: the significance of ending
term limits, the intended consequences
and the unintended
consequences. Though terminating
the two-term limit for China’s
presidency captures headlines, it
is more the symbolic, final step
ratifying Xi’s near-absolute power
than the big breakthrough itself.
Many expect this
experiment to
end badly for
China. It is
indeed an
experiment but
its end is not set
Xi’s prior designation as “core” of
the Communist Party in October
2016 and the inscribing of “Xi
Jinping Thought...” into the party
constitution in October 2017 were
more meaningful.
Moreover, the Politburo
Standing Committee, the highest
authoritative body in China,
unambiguously supports Xi.
China watchers see the front page
of People’s Daily – published the
day after the new Standing Committee
marched out on stage –
which featured Xi’s photo on top,
many times larger than the smaller,
subservient photo of all seven
members lined up on the bottom.
All this reconfirms that, in a
system where the party controls
the state – especially where the
party is Marxist and ideology is its
basis for being – Xi, as core of the
party, with his name inscribed in
the constitutions of party and
state as the contemporary arbiter
of Marxism, will be the uncontested,
overarching leader of China
for the rest of his sentient life.
For intended consequences,
the official line is that the purpose
is national cohesion brought
about when the three top leadership
positions – general secretary
of the party, chairman of the Central
Military Commission and
president of the republic – are
aligned temporally and held by a
single person.
This makes sense, but as a
primary, proximal motivation, it is
not entirely persuasive. The
current structure has existed for
decades without outcry or angst
(not to mention that the three positions
could be unified by installing
term limits on the other two).
The “new era”, marked by economic,
social and global complexities,
is said to require firm
and consistent leadership, making
moot inner party struggles
and even mitigating political gossip,
facilitating focus on the tasks
of governance and development.
Specifically, because advancing
reform has become more difficult,
with entrenched interest groups
resisting change, the message
must now go forth that all must
get with the programme, because
you can’t outwit or outwait Xi.
Because, it is said that only Xi
has the vision, experience, competence
and character to bring
about “the great rejuvenation of
the Chinese people”, especially
from 2020 to 2035 and ultimately
to 2050 – bringing China to global
centre stage – Xi’s unimpeded
leadership is deemed essential.
China cannot afford “downtime”
to accommodate a change of
leadership, and after Xi’s success
at the 19th National Party Congress
came the time to make clear
that he will call the shots for the
foreseeable future.
Some argue that doing away
with term limits shows the superiority
of the Chinese system as it
allows flexibility in matching
leadership to requirements
(though what national leader,
when extending his reach, has not
claimed “current requirements”
as justification?).
The party-run Global Times
stated that ending term limits
does not mean China has reverted
to president-for-life tenure. (But
who can deny that however long
Xi holds the top positions seems
largely up to him?)
As for the unintended consequences,
the almost unanimous,
disparaging foreign reaction –
other than US President Donald
Trump’s – did not burnish China’s
international image.
More worrisome would be a
reluctance by officials to offer
constructive opposing views on
central policies.
By stressing term limits, the
international media misses
fundamental changes going on in
China – this year, innovation,
streamlining of government, facilitation
of business (cutting
bureaucracy and reducing taxes),
rural revitalisation and rural land
reform. The 13th National People’s
Congress shows how the
grand vision and mission of the
19th National Party Congress is
translated into specific strategies
and policies. If one sees only term
limits, one cannot visualise the big
picture.
As for Xi maintaining the presidency
perpetually, it doesn’t actually
matter much – this is the deep
insight of how China’s party-state
system works. Xi as core of the
party and “Xi Jinping Thought...”
as the party’s (and now the state’s)
guiding principle means that Xi
can transfer titular party leadership
and/or the presidency to others
and still maintain his
overarching power. It may well be
that, after serving two or even
three more terms, rather than trying
to find and install another
leader like himself, he will move to
bring about true democracy within
the party.
Here’s the best case. Xi will not
be leader-for-life, but leader long
enough to bring about China’s
national rejuvenation and establish
a Chinese kind of democratic
norms. Could Xi continue until
around 2035, when China plans to
have “basically” achieved full modernisation,
heading towards, by
mid-century, 2050, a “great modern
socialist country”?
Many expect this experiment
to end badly for China. It is indeed
an experiment but its end is not
set. It may be a race between
achieving Xi’s grand vision and
some untoward perturbation that
could cause fracture.
All factors considered, I am not
saying abolishing term limits is
absolutely good for China. I am
saying it may be good – because of
China’s special conditions and
Xi’s special capabilities – but if it is
good, it’s just for this once, and it’s
just for so long. That’s the best
case. I’m rooting for Xi.

Private clubs
deserve ‘cushy’
rental deals
Edith Terry says private recreational
clubs are part of Hong Kong’s
heritage and have contributed to
nurturing less popular sports, as
well as a unique hybrid culture
In 1964, a young German, fresh off the plane at his
first job, went in search of a social group. He found a
home away from home in Hong Kong’s oldest
private recreational club, newly relocated from a prime
location on Victoria Harbour, where City Hall is today,
to a modest flagstone boathouse beneath Island Road
on Hong Kong’s south side. Fifty-five years later, Frank
Pfeiffer, a Zen Buddhist and mountain climber, is still
an active member of the Victoria Recreation Club,
established in 1849. He has watched it ring the changes
from Hong Kong’s colonial society in the 1960s, when it
had only two Chinese members and no female
members, to the hybrid institution it is today, under its
first Hong Kong Chinese chairman, Wu Kam Shing.
Its membership is a spectrum of Hong Kong’s
diverse and athletically minded middle class. There is
the Hong Kong Chinese court reporter who visits the
club in Deep Water Bay every morning at 6am on her
way from home in Ap Lei Chau to her workplace in Sha
Tin. There are her fellow swimmers, many elderly, who
swim out to the buoys, rain or shine, hot or cold, every
day. Some 100-150 “paddlers” use the club as a base for
outrigger canoeing, dragon boating and paddle
boarding. Some of the sports were unknown to Hong
Kong before the club nurtured them, others, like
dragon boating, are deeply traditional.
In the current debate over the future of the 67
private recreational clubs that pay minimal rents to the
government, history has been swept aside. True, they
were designed on a colonial template, in which the
diverse ethnic groups were given separate retreats.
Membership at the pinnacle clubs was reserved
primarily for the British. For other ethnic groups, there
was a Chinese Recreation Club, a Club de Recreio, a
Filipino Club, an Indian Recreation Club, and so on.
Hong Kong’s colonial rulers reviewed the lease
system for the private clubs in 1968 and 1979, and in
the run-up to the handover in 1997 when leases were
restricted to 15-year terms. At the handover, a number
of leases were extended to ensure a so-called smooth
transition. The sceptic would argue that this was a
dodge, and indeed, in 2011, during the first post-1997
review of private recreational leases by the Legislative
Council, most of the clubs seemed oblivious to public
concerns as well as new requirements for “opening up”
The government argued
that subsidies were
needed because use of land
for sports and recreation
would never trump
commercial utilisation
What the Western belt and road sceptics are missing
Wenshan Jia says there are opportunities for the whole world to benefit from China’s initiative
China’s “Belt and Road Initiative”is
an original plan to carry out a new
type of “collaborative globalisation”
above and beyond US-led type. It was
proposed five years ago by President Xi
Jinping after the tapering off of US-led
globalisation in 2008.
Xi offered three principles: mutual
consultation, joint construction and
shared benefits. China has since then fully
executed 101 agreements with 86
countries, and total investment in the 24
countries along the belt and road regions
has amounted to US$50 billion, resulting
in 75 industrial and trade zones, and
200,000 jobs.
With its focus on infrastructure, the
initiative is a model not only for developing
countries, but also industrialised ones in
Europe and North America, where ageing
infrastructure needs replacing. It also
adapts to each local, national or regional
condition, situation and need. It is proving
very democratic, more so than the
lopsided US-led globalisation that spurred
a populist, isolationist backlash across the
Western world.
China has done a proper job of
explaining to the West what the initiative is
and extended a sincere invitation to each
country to join. Many think tank scholars
and major media outlets in the West have
found it potentially lucrative and
expressed relatively strong support.
Yet, instead of appreciating China’s
efforts to both inherit the liberal agenda of
globalisation and forge a new path for
global development, many Western
political elite, led by the US, have started a
campaign to resist the initiative. From
Australia to the US , and the UK to
Germany, there are calls for the West to cut
interactions with China to minimise or
resist its so-called “sharp power”. The
labels typically applied to China include
“authoritarian” and “predatory”, citing
Beijing for not upholding “freedom,
democracy and individual rights”, the core
values of the West.
This attitude towards the initiative
reveals not only a contradiction in the
Western mind, but also the narrowing or
even closing of minds.
Isn’t it beneficial to meet the goals of
forging connectivity and cooperation, as
articulated in Xi’s effort to enrich and
expand the meaning of the “free world” by
liberating humankind from geographical,
financial, political and cultural barriers?
The world is no longer the West versus the
rest, as we already live in a world
connected by the internet. The initiative
seeks to make the world more
interconnected for both the West and the
rest, contributing to the construction of a
human community with a shared future.
Recently, the initiative has inspired and
spawned a push for localisation,
particularly the Indo-Pacific strategy led by
the so-called “Quad” of the US, India,
Japan and Australia. Some Western media
view it as a rival or alternative to China’s
belt and road.
But I would argue that it can be part of
China’s initiative as long as the three
Chinese principles (mutual consultation,
The anti-China smear
campaign must be
replaced by a
discourse involving
consultation and
communication
joint construction and shared benefits) are
observed in the Quad strategy. The belt
and road was created to be an all-inclusive
platform, so Beijing has no need to fear
localisation as long as such strategies do
not seek to contain China or disrupt its
plan. It would be wise for the Quad and
China to look for ways to collaborate.
Quad countries need not take an
antagonistic stance towards China; the
anti-China smear campaign must be
replaced by a discourse involving
consultation and communication. The
world has experienced more than enough
damaging talk, not to mention wars.
The core principles of Xi’s belt and road
strategy must be always applied in China’s
interactions with local strategies. If China
is, as German Foreign Minister Sigmar
Gabriel told the Munich Security
Conference in February, “the only country
in the world with any sort of genuinely
global, geostrategic concept”, then
Western leaders should cultivate a
genuinely global strategy in line with
China’s vision, for the betterment of all
humankind.
Wenshan Jia, PhD, is a professor in the
School of Communication, at Chapman
University (California) and a research fellow
at the National Academy of Development
and Strategy, Renmin University of China
to schools and community organisations. Following
the last well-publicised review in 2013 and the current
investigation seeking new venues for public housing,
they are no longer complacent.
Should the private clubs have got their cushy rental
deals in the first place? At the time of the reviews 50
years ago, the government argued that subsidies were
needed because use of land for sports and recreation
would never trump commercial utilisation. What was
true then is even more so today. The high cost of land in
Hong Kong is a drag on innovation and creativity. The
existence of the private recreational clubs means it has
been less of a drag on sports.
Most of the clubs with government leases are
framed around core sports – golf, tennis, horse racing,
swimming, sailing and rowing, to name a few. Hong
Kong athletes whose development was supported by
these clubs have gone to the Olympics and other
international competitions. In the 1940s, the Victoria
Recreation Club was the driving force behind Hong
Kong’s participation in the International Olympic
Committee and the Hong Kong Sports Federation.
Public pressure on the clubs to forge community
ties and contribute to Hong Kong through “opening
up” schemes is appropriate – but not the pressure to
convert their land to high-rise estates. The loss is not
only to the core sports they represent but also to their
unique DNA, which is the foundation of Hong Kong –
diverse, cosmopolitan and adventurous. If you want to
look for a Hong Kong that is not just about money, one
place to look is here.

2017 YEAR-END: Politics
Robert Lawrence Kuhn
Watching China’s year for history
When future historians reconstruct
the long history of China,
they will likely circle 2017
as a year of significance. I’ve
seen it all this year, and attended or even
participated in the major events. I’ve conversed
with Chinese leaders and experts,
and searched for meaning.
I didn’t appreciate the opportunity I’ve
had until I began reviewing the year from
China’s domestic perspective, seeking
themes and trends, discerning from what
we know about the recent past to what we
might forecast about the near-term future.
It takes no flash of insight to see the leadership
and vision of President Xi Jinping
headlining almost every event.
Following is the review of the meaningful
events of 2017.
January: Xi began
the year with a memorable
speech at the
World Economic Forum
in Davos, Switzerland,
mounting a roaring
defense of globalization,
free trade, and
Robert Lawrence
Kuhn
economic openness and
liberalization. It was the
first-ever speech by China’s
head of state at
Davos and, as commentators the world over
noted with amazement and irony, as the
United States under President Donald
Trump was apparently retreating from the
world and abrogating global leadership,
China under President Xi was apparently
defending the international order and promoting
global governance.
March: The annual “two sessions” of the
National People’s Congress, China’s top legislature,
and the Chinese People’s Political
Consultative Conference National Committee,
the top political advisory body, seemed
to radiate more energy than usual, perhaps
in anticipation of the 19th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China in
the fall. A highlight was the adoption of the
draft general provisions of civil law, a step
closer to a long-needed unified civil code.
I sensed delegates’ growing confidence
and assertiveness to represent their particular
sectors in the competitive marketplace
of public ideas and government funding, a
competition that is vital for the development
of China’s kind of consultative democracy.
This was especially true of the CPPCC
National Committee, whose members are
often leading experts in their fields, such
that even though they do not have legal
authority to pass laws, they have moral
authority to exert pressure and affect
change. It did not escape notice that,
throughout the “two sessions”, Xi was recognized
repeatedly as “core” of the CPC Central
Committee and of the whole Party.
Belt and Road to the fore
May: The first “Belt and Road Summit”
(the Belt and Road Forum for International
Cooperation), held in Beijing, was the diplomatic
highlight of the year in China. Some
130 countries participated, including 29
heads of state and government. The goal
was no less than the transformation of the
economic structure of the developing
world: building infrastructure and connectivity,
stimulating development, alleviating
poverty, reducing severe imbalances, promoting
South-South cooperation, and revitalizing
globalization.
Xi called the Belt and Road Initiative “the
project of the century”.
July: China celebrated the 20th anniversary
of Hong Kong’s return to the motherland.
It was a time of reflection for the
cosmopolitan city, long a global leader in
economic freedom and competitiveness.
Hong Kong had flourished: its way of life
preserved, its economy dynamic. But times
change. With Shanghai and Shenzhen on
the rise, and with some claiming the “one
country, two systems” principle is in
decline, Hong Kong faces new challenges.
August: The People’s Liberation Army
celebrated its 90th anniversary. In a move
both practical and symbolic, the PLA established
its first overseas logistics base in Djibouti,
situated strategically on the Horn of
Africa.
Xi Jinping, who is also chairman of the
Central Military Commission, said the PLA
is becoming “strong” informationized
armed forces. “The Chinese people love
peace,” Xi said. “We will never seek aggression
or expansion, but … No one should
expect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is
harmful to our sovereignty, security or
development interests”.
Foreigners are wondering: what is the
PLA’s long-term plan for operating overseas?
What will be the impact of the PLA’s
modernization and reform, especially its
burgeoning blue-water navy with multiple
aircraft carriers?
August: China hosted the BRICS Summit
in Xiamen, East China’s Fujian province.
The five BRICS countries — Brazil,
Russia, India, China and South Africa —
have increasing influence on global economy
and politics, but does BRICS as an organization
make sense? China certainly thinks
so, and promoted the BRICS Summit as
representing a new kind of multilateral
global governance. There are complexities:
political instabilities in Brazil and South
Africa; the growing, comprehensive cooperation
between Russia and China; the sensitive,
multifaceted relationship
between India and China.
Throughout the year, events on the
Korean Peninsula continued to
intrude. While China continued to
call for denuclearization and dialogue,
just hours before Xi gave
the opening speech at the BRICS
Summit, the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea detonated its
most powerful nuclear bomb
ever.
19th Party Congress
and the New Era
October: The highlight of the
year was, as expected, the 19th
CPC National Congress. Not quite
expected were the far-reaching
proclamations and, taken together,
the magnitude of their significance. I
witnessed history and see six highlights.
First, Xi’s name and thought were written
into the CPC Constitution — “Xi Jinping
Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
for a New Era”. Xi is now, officially,
the overarching creator and arbiter of political
thought, and combined with his designation
as “core” of the CPC, he is now the
undisputed, unimpeded leader with singular
authority. Xi Jinping “thought” is built
on the twin pillars of people orientation and
national rejuvenation, with the new concept
of development (innovation, coordination,
green, open, sharing) driving a new
kind of economic growth.
Second, the “New Era”, which is intended
as a policy-energizing game changer, is a
conceptual lens with which to view the
range of goals, strategies and concepts that
compose Xi’s way of thinking and the Party’s
new direction.
The “New Era” is envisioned in three temporal
segments: (i) from now until the fulfillment
of China’s first centenary goal of a
“moderately prosperous society” in 2020
(2021 being the 100th anniversary of the
CPC); (ii) from 2020 to 2035, when the CPC
states it will build on the foundation of the
moderately prosperous society so that, after
“15 years of hard work”, the country will
“basically” realize “socialist modernization”;
and (iii) from 2035 to 2050, when the CPC
states it will “work hard for a further 15
years” and “develop China into a country
that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally
advanced, harmonious, and beautiful”.
Realizing this vision at mid-century,
around 2050, with China being respected as
a great, modern, socialist country, is the second
centenary goal (2049 being the 100th
anniversary of the People’s Republic of China).
Third, the new “principal contradiction”
in China’s “New Era” is between “unbalanced
and inadequate development” and
“the people’s ever-growing needs for a better
life”, which includes increasingly broad
demands for “democracy, rule of law, fairness
and justice, security, and a better environment”.
From now on, this new-era
principal contradiction, replacing quantitative
GDP growth with qualitative improvement
of life, is what will guide China’s
domestic affairs and policies.
Fourth, the Party’s leadership role in governing
the country is expanding and the
Party’s stringent approach to governing
itself is intensifying. The Party will be more
deeply embedded within agencies of government
and sectors of society (including
private companies, foreign businesses and
educational institutions), and by reforming
and purifying itself, the Party’s governance
will be stricter and more comprehensive.
The anti-corruption campaign, not only
continues, it has been enhanced.
Fifth, the “New Era” has China moving
closer to center stage of the world and making
greater contributions to humanity,
offering “Chinese wisdom” and “Chinese
solutions” for world problems. China’s
diplomacy will be proactive, championing
the development of a community with a
shared future for humanity and encouraging
the evolution of the global governance
system.
Sixth, I watched the new senior leaders of
China, the seven members of the new
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee, walk out on
stage, ending months, really years, of speculation
and rumor. Because everything in
China reports to a Political Bureau Standing
Committee member, and because of the
Party’s principle of collective leadership,
their personalities, composition and balance
determine the vision, strategies and
policies that shape China.
The importance of the Political Bureau
Standing Committee remains true today,
but its importance frankly is also less true
today. It is hard to overstate the consequences
of Xi’s name written into the Party
Constitution, thus inscribing into perpetuity
his predominant status and assuring
his continuing pre-eminence in the coun-
try’s political life.
Following the 19th Party Congress, some
might have expected a respite, a slower
November and December. They were anything
but.
Form is substance
November: The “state visit-plus” of US
President Donald Trump came at a delicate
moment. Amid pomp and pageantry,
including a personal tour of the Palace
Museum (Forbidden City), $253 billion in
business deals were signed, a world record,
though critics complained it was all transactional,
nothing structural. The number,
some said, was more form than substance,
but here, perhaps, form was substance.
Both Xi and Trump hailed the visit as “successful
and historic”.
Yet, on sensitive topics, one could be forgiven
for seeing sunlight between their
positions. On trade, Xi lauded the business
deals and market access, “which will deliver
great benefits for the two peoples”. Trump
sought improved trade with China based on
“a level playing field for our workers” and
solving the “massive trade distortion” —
which, characteristically, Trump blamed on
past US administrations, not on China.
On the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea, Xi reiterated China’s firm commitment
for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula
and direct communications, while Trump
said that they “agreed not to replicate failed
approaches of the past” and he called for
“increased economic pressure until North
Korea abandons its reckless and dangerous
path”.
Subsequent to Trump’s visit, China
announced revised regulations that were
indeed structural. China will reduce or
eliminate (over time) limits on foreign
ownership of financial services sectors,
including insurance, commercial banking,
securities, futures, and asset management.
Significantly, the State Council, China’s
Cabinet, established a Financial Stability
and Development Committee to oversee
financial stability and boost risk prevention
(including close monitoring of “shadow
banking” and corporate debt). This new
supra-ministry commission will be empowered
to make decisions related to reform
and development, coordinate issues concerning
monetary policy, and establish
financial policies and related fiscal and
industrial policies, thus improving the
financial regulatory system.
At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
Leaders’ Meeting in Vietnam, Xi strengthened
his themes of making economic globalization
more open, balanced and
inclusive; lauded regional multilateralism
for promoting common interests; and
stressed the Belt and Road Initiative for
advancing global connectivity.
What struck me in Xi’s speech was what
he inserted about poverty: “To lift all the
remaining poor people out of poverty is a
solemn commitment made by the Chinese
government to the people. It is uppermost
in my mind, and I have spent more energy
on poverty alleviation than on anything
else.”
“Upper most in my mind?” “More energy
on poverty alleviation than on anything
else?” An extraordinary statement from the
president! Although Xi has been making
high-profile visits to numerous poor counties
and villages, relentlessly championing
“targeted poverty alleviation” for realizing
the “moderately prosperous society”, this
was his clearest statement that poverty alleviation
is his highest priority.
Main contradiction reinforced
Two unpleasant events in Beijing reinforced
the new “principal contradiction”,
highlighting “the people’s ever-growing
needs for a better life” as that surprisingly
powerful lens for viewing Chinese society.
The first was alleged child abuse at a kindergarten.
The second was a fire in which
19 migrant workers died. In both cases, netizens
reacted with anger: in the alleged
child abuse, anger about a perceived coverup;
in the fire, anger for the disorderly and
inconsiderate way of evacuating migrant
workers.
When Xi first announced the new principal
contradiction at the 19th Party Congress,
some dismissed it as arcane Partyspeak.
Public reaction to the alleged child
abuse and to the fire revealed its prescient
and perspicacious wisdom.
The second volume of Xi Jinping: The
Governance of China, a collection of 99 of
Xi’s speeches, conversations, instructions
and letters, was published. The book offers
a resource to follow the development of Xi’s
ways of thinking and ideas and to understand
China’s new guiding philosophy and
the specific elements that compose it.
The month ended with what may seem a
light touch when Xi called for China to
upgrade its toilets. Toilets among the year’s
highlights? Xi was serious and his point is
probative. For China to become a more civilized
society, the hygiene of the people must
be improved (especially in rural areas), and
for China’s tourism industry to blossom,
better bathrooms are needed. Although
China’s leader talking toilets elicits smiles,
and some say it downgrades his dignity, it
demonstrates, above all, Xi’s intrinsic commitment
to improve the quality of life for
the Chinese people.
December: In the first nine days of the
month, Xi engaged with four international
events, stressing common commitment to
build a community of a shared future for all
humanity.
The four engagements
SHI YU / CHINA DAILY
To the “CPC in Dialogue with World Political
Parties High-Level Meeting”, Xi
described four views of the future: a world
that is safe and free of fear; prosperous and
free of poverty; open, inclusive and free of
isolation; and environmentally clean and
beautiful.
At the “Fourth World Internet Conference”,
Xi asserted how the internet posed
new challenges for sovereignty, security and
development.
At the “2017 Fortune Global Forum”, Xi
called for openness and innovation to
enhance global economic growth, pledging
to liberalize and facilitate trade and foreign
investment in China.
And at the “South-South Human Rights
Forum”, Xi emphasized that “human rights
must and can only be promoted in light of
specific national conditions and people’s
needs”.
The CPC’s Dialogue with World Political
Parties was path-setting in that it put the
world on notice that a transformed CPC
under Xi is reaching out globally with pride
and confidence — explaining, especially to
developing countries, the developmental
benefits of party leadership and party building.
The point of debate, as it were, has
shifted from whether the China model of a
perpetually ruling party (with all that
entails) is good for China to how the China
model is good for other countries.
At a meeting of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee, Xi directed authorities
to improve digital infrastructure, promote
the integration and sharing of digital
resources, and protect data security, in
order to better serve the nation’s economic
and social development as well as to
improve people’s lives. The big vision is to
turn China into a world leader in big data
and a global innovation hub for artificial
intelligence by 2030.
The last major event of the year was the
annual Central Economic Work Conference,
which identified “three tough battles” for
the next three years: preventing and defusing
risks (especially financial risks), eliminating
absolute poverty (China’s 2020 goal),
and curbing pollution (for instance, encouraging
investment in environmental projects).
Setting three-year targets was itself
an innovation (over the traditional one-year
targets), thereby strengthening long-term
thinking, reducing pressures to make hasty
decisions, and giving markets stable expectations.
The priority of reducing absolute debt
was modified to controlling a rise in borrowing,
such that China’s debt-to-GDP ratio
does not further deteriorate. This signaled
that growth would not be jeopardized and
(to the disappointment of some) debt-driven
growth would continue.
To contain financial risk, China will
crackdown on irregular and illegal activities
in its chaotic financial industry and intensify
regulatory scrutiny; continue supply-side
structural reform (reducing overcapacities);
and maintain a proactive fiscal policy, a
prudent and neutral monetary policy, and a
basically stable yuan exchange rate.
Resisting arguments for shrinking Stateowned
enterprises, China will make SOEs
“stronger, better and bigger”; and the government
will seek efficiencies by becoming
more of an investor and less of an operator.
China pledged to open up its markets further
and to balance trade by boosting
imports (US pressures, expressed vividly by
Trump, were not mentioned).
Theoretical foundation
After five years of “practice”, the theoretical
foundation of China’s economic development
is now labeled, “Xi Jinping
Thought on Socialist Economy with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era”, paralleling
the phrase added to the Party
Constitution two months earlier. The
“thought” is based mainly on Xi’s new concept
of development — innovative, coordinated,
green, open and shared development
— which has been the core of his economic
philosophy.
For the first time at this annual conference,
topics other than economics were on
the agenda. Diverse public concerns were
addressed, such as burdensome homework
for schoolchildren, sex discrimination in
the workplace, and online scams. This was a
clear consequence of how China’s new
“principal contradiction” in the “New Era”
now drives domestic policy; as Chinese citizens
seek a “better life”, the government
must respond.
To pick one message to characterize the
year, it is this. In 2017, under the leadership
of Xi, China set the trajectory, in all vital
areas, of the country’s domestic development
and international engagement for the
next 30-plus years, to mid-century, to 2050.
Every year brings challenges. For China,
no doubt, big ones lie ahead. In 2018, China
will celebrate the 40th anniversary of
reform and opening-up. The world is
watching.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn
New era on the road to 2050
Iwitnessed history sitting in the Great
Hall of the People during the 19th
National Congress of the Communist
Party of China. I listened raptly to
Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC
Central Committee, when he delivered his
new-era-defining report. I heard the
amendment to the Party Constitution that
enshrined “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics for a New
Era”. I watched members of the new Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee walk out on stage. I
was awed by the presence of the leadership,
past and present. And I was overawed by
Xi’s grand vision for China and the country’s
increasing, radiating confidence. Most of all,
I marveled at the remarkable and historic
transformation of China, which means so
much to the Chinese people and which in
this new era will mean so much to the rest
of the world.
Having departed the Great Hall of the
People, I reflected how I, an American,
found myself caught up in the welling Chinese
patriotism of the 19th CPC National
Congress. Certainly, I was experiencing firsthand
this inflection point in Chinese history,
when China envisions itself becoming a
fully modernized country and taking proactive
part in international affairs, and
regaining its leading seat at the high table of
great nations.
What have I just witnessed? Following are
some personal observations.
A general consensus describes four primary
outcomes of the 19th Party Congress:
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era; a new
“contradiction” that defines China’s principal
social challenge; a China that takes “center
stage in the world”; and the Party
enhancing its leadership of society, including
maintaining, indeed intensifying, its
anti-corruption campaign.
To me, however, a highlight was the specificity
of Xi’s vision of China, not only establishing
policies for the next five years, but also
framing the agenda and setting the strategies
for the next 30 years. This congress, Xi said, is
the “confluence” of the “Two Centenary
Goals”: a moderately prosperous society by
2020 (2021 being the 100th anniversary of
the CPC), which will likely be fulfilled within
the term of the 19th Party Congress, and a
great, modern, socialist country by 2050
(2049 being the 100th anniversary of the People’s
Republic of China), which is being
planned by the 19th Party Congress.
In a multi-meaning refinement, the path
to mid-century is now designed in two stages.
In the first stage, from 2020 to 2035, the
Party states it will build on the foundation of
the moderately prosperous society such that,
after “15 years of hard work”, the country will
basically realize “socialist modernization”.
In the second stage, from 2035 to 2050, the
CPC states it will build on a basically achieved
modernization, “work hard for a further 15
years” and “develop China into a great modern
socialist country that is prosperous,
strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious,
and beautiful”. China portrays its
mid-century self as a global leader in every
area of human consequence: economics and
trade, science and technology, military and
defense, culture and governance.
But Chinese leaders, and officials in general,
seem to have a different highlight. While
the “Two Centenary Goals” are certainly vital,
especially with new stages and specificity, they
focus on the amendment to the Party Constitution:
“Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”.
“The (Xi’s) thought is the biggest highlight
of the 19th National Congress of the
CPC and a historic contribution to the Party’s
development,” said Zhang Dejiang, the
third-ranking member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the
18th CPC Central Committee. Liu Yunshan,
the fifth-ranking member, said the elevation
of Xi’s thought to the Party’s guiding principle
is of great political, theoretical and practical
significance.
I take a closer look at Xi’s thought: first by
examining each of its elements, then by considering
its unified significance.
“Xi Jinping” is the “core” of the CPC Central
Committee and of the whole Party, and
he thereby at the top level provides the “centralism”
of the Party’s cardinal principle of
democratic centralism.
The “Thought” is the totality of Xi’s fundamental
principles. I see four broad categories:
people orientation, national
rejuvenation, comprehensive development,
and Party leadership.
In his report, Xi listed 14 categories: Party
leadership over all aspects of society; people-centered
policies; deepening reform
comprehensively; new concept of development
(innovation, coordination, green,
open, and sharing); people as masters of the
country; adherence to rule of law, comprehensively
governing the country by law;
socialist value system and cultural confidence;
protecting and improving people’s
livelihoods; harmonious coexistence of man
and nature (ecological civilization); national
security; the Party’s absolute leadership
over the military; “one country, two systems”
and promoting reunification with Taiwan;
international community of a shared
future for all humanity; and comprehensive
and strict Party governance.
The term “thought” in Chinese has special
meaning because before this it had been
associated only with Mao Zedong — “Mao
Zedong Thought”.
“Socialism” is a set of political ideas with a
complex history, unified by public or common
ownership of the means of production
and concern for the masses.
“Chinese characteristics” is the phrase,
originating with Deng Xiaoping, that adapts
Marxism to China’s special conditions — the
Sinicization of Marxism in modern China —
which includes the market playing a decisive
role in the allocation of resources and the
encouragement of non-public, for-profit businesses,
while at the same time State-owned
enterprises still playing a dominant role.
“New Era” is a new idea in the constitutional
amendment, and it is designed to
profoundly transform the essence of socialism
with Chinese characteristics into the
vision, concepts and strategies that compose
Xi’s way of thinking.
The more I reflect, the more I see “New
Era” as a conceptual lens with which to view
the 19th Party Congress. Semi-official Party
analysts say the new era answers five questions.
Robert
Lawrence Kuhn
What “road” to take? Socialism with Chinese
characteristics under new historical
conditions.
What kind of country to build? First, a
moderately prosperous society and then a
modernized socialist country.
What development to realize? Better life
and common prosperity for all.
What goal to achieve? The great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation.
What contribution to make? Facilitate
world peace and prosperity (exemplified by
the Belt and Road Initiative of building
infrastructure in developing countries).
Thus, Xi Jinping joins only Mao Zedong
and Deng Xiaoping in having his name
affixed to a political philosophy in the Party
Constitution, a blazing sign lost on no one.
It then would follow that the “New Era” into
which China is now entering is the third era
of the CPC and by extension of the People’s
Republic of China.
A seemingly subtle but significant
change is the Party’s judgment of what constitutes
the fundamental “contradiction” in
Chinese society. (“Contradiction” is a Marxist
term expressing a particular way of
political thinking — dialectical materialism
— which identifies “dynamic opposing forces”
in society and seeks to resolve the
resulting tensions).
The principal contradiction has evolved
from one between the ever-growing material
and cultural needs of the people and
backward social production to that between
“unbalanced and inadequate development
and the people’s ever-growing needs for a
better life,” Xi said. The needs for the people
to live a better life are increasingly broad
and have to be met. Not only have their
material and cultural needs grown; their
demands for democracy, rule of law, fairness
and justice, security, and a better environment
are increasing.
This “New-Era” contradiction, replacing
quantitative GDP growth with qualitative
improvement of life, is what will drive China’s
policy.
The mission of a CPC congress is to review
and assess achievements of the previous five
years, and to forecast challenges and set targets
for the subsequent five years (and
beyond). Overall, for the 19th Party Congress,
the ambition of the goals and the comprehensiveness
of the categories
were clear,
amplified by the commitment
to deepen reform.
Here, by category, are
what stood out.
The Party and the
fight against corruption.
Confidence in
socialism and the
increasing role of the
Party in managing all
aspects of the country is unequivocal, and
the increasingly strict governance of the
Party, by reforming and purifying itself, is
unambiguous. Moreover, the anti-corruption
campaign not only continues but also
will be enhanced.
Economy. After more than three decades
of rapid growth, China’s economy has been
transitioning to slower but higher-quality
growth. Supply-side structural reform has
been written into the Constitution. No GDP
growth targets are set. The country focuses
on the real economy (as opposed to speculation,
such as in the real estate sector). China
is not backing away from State-owned
enterprises, rather it will support State capital
in “becoming stronger, doing better, and
growing bigger, thereby turning Chinese
enterprises into world-class, globally competitive
firms”.
Consumption is fundamental in driving
economic growth. The framework of regulations
must be improved, prudent macroeconomic
and monetary policy maintained,
and interest and exchange rates made more
market-based. For economic development,
innovation leads, especially in science and
technology.
Poverty alleviation. Xi has made the
elimination of extreme poverty in China by
2020 a cornerstone of his domestic policy.
After all, how could China claim to have
achieved a moderately prosperous society
by 2020 if millions of its citizens would be
still living in extreme poverty?
Opening-up. China reasserts its commitment
to become more open, including
easing market access and protecting the
rights and interests of foreign investors.
China’s economists see foreign competition
as upgrading the quality and cost efficiency
of Chinese companies, thus better serving
Chinese consumers.
Rule of Law. Strengthening and institutionalizing
the rule of law, and weakening
arbitrary rule of officials, is a priority.
Reflecting Xi’s commitment, the Party is setting
up a central leading group for advancing
law-based governance in all areas,
coordinating the activities of judicial
organs. The goal is to complete the transformation
of China’s legal system by 2035 with
theoretical foundations and practical
enforcement.
Ecology. Beautiful China is one of the
country’s main descriptions for its second
centenary goal by the middle of the century.
This modernization is characterized by harmonious
coexistence between humanity
and nature (such as nature parks) and it
requires substantial bolstering of regulatory
agencies and their enforcement powers.
Armed forces. China’s goal is to transform
the People’s Liberation Army into a
world-class military by mid-century, basically
completing military reform and modernization
by 2035, with information
technology/cyber applications and strategic
capabilities prioritized.
Especially significant for Xi’s mission are
the two “anti’s” — anti-corruption and antipoverty
— the former to support the Party’s
continuing leadership, the latter as a prime
example of what the Party has delivered.
Xi does not downplay a realistic appraisal
of problems, including social imbalances,
industrial overcapacities, financial system
risks, endemic pollution. “Achieving national
rejuvenation will be no walk in the park,”
Xi said, an example of his plainspoken candor.
“It will take more than drum-beating
and gong-clanging to get there.”
The speculations of China watchers, and
the focus of the international media, have
been on the new Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
Because everything in China reports to
a standing committee member, composition
and balance determine the vision, strategies
and policies that will shape China.
This remains true today, but less true
today. It is hard to overstate the significance
of Xi Jinping’s name written into the
Party Constitution. Xi is now, officially, the
originating designator and overarching
arbiter of “Thought” as it relates to “Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics for a New
Era”, which is the guiding political theory of
China and encompasses, essentially, everything
in China. For Xi to be named in the
CPC Constitution is the ultimate in authority,
surpassing even “core” (which already
had superseded all other leaders), thus setting
into perpetuity Xi’s predominant status
and assuring his preeminence in the
country’s political life.
That said, to know China is to know the
members of the Standing Committee. They
are a highly competent, highly experienced
group: six of the seven have run provinces
or province-level municipalities, many of
which, in terms of population and GDP, are
the equivalent of major nations.
Traditional norms of balance and age are
respected. It’s a diverse group — by geography,
education and political career. They
ZHAI HAIJUN / FOR CHINA DAILY
have worked together, in various combinations,
for years. With much now being written
about each member, I’ll just offer some
personal reflections.
First, of course, is Xi Jinping, general secretary
of the CPC Central Committee, whose
prior experience included governor of Fujian
province and Party secretary of Zhejiang
province and Shanghai.
In 2005, I was advised to study the “Zhejiang
model”, which promotes entrepreneurship
to generate economic development. I
met Xi, who was then Zhejiang provincial
Party secretary, and he recommended that I
study China both “horizontally” across
diverse regions and “vertically” through the
history of its development.
“To understand our dedication to revitalize
the country, one has to appreciate the pride
that Chinese people take in our glorious
ancient civilization,” Xi said. “This is the historical
driving force inspiring people today to
build the nation. The Chinese people made
great contributions to world civilization and
enjoyed long-term prosperity,” he said. “Then
we suffered over a century of national weakness,
oppression and humiliation. So, we
have a deep self-motivation to build our
country. Our commitment and determination
is rooted in our patriotism and pride.”
But he cautioned that pride in China’s
recent achievements should not engender
complacency.
Second, premier of the State Council, is
Li Keqiang, who was Party secretary of Henan
and Liaoning provinces. When I visited
Li in Liaoning, he explained the complex
challenges of revitalizing State-owned
enterprises while creating a fertile environment
for private businesses. Li shared the
same experience of Xi as educated youths in
the countryside in the 1970s. The experience
gave them the chance to know better rural
China and the lives of rural people and thus
fostered their people-orientation.
The following members are new:
Li Zhanshu, who was governor of Heilongjiang
province and Party secretary of
Guizhou province, has been director of the
general office of the CPC Central Committee
since 2012.
Wang Yang, vice-premier, is former Party
secretary of Chongqing municipality and
Guangdong province. At the height of the
global financial crisis in early 2009, he
argued it was imperative to restructure
Guangdong’s economy, so that it can move
up the ladder of industrialization and promote
more knowledge-based, high-tech, lowpolluting
businesses.
Wang Huning, secretariat, is director of
the Policy Research Office of the CPC Central
Committee. Wang is well known for providing
intellectual vision and sophistication in
support of practical strategies and policies,
ranging from political philosophy to international
relations.
Zhao Leji, new chairman of the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection, has
served as head of the CPC Organization
Department, and before that, as Party secretary
of Qinghai and Shaanxi provinces. In
addition to his responsibilities for Party and
government officials, Zhao provided strong
support for the poverty-alleviation mission.
Han Zheng is Party secretary of Shanghai.
Under his leadership, Shanghai has become
a recognized leader in trade, logistics and
finance.
What is the impact of all this on China’s
international relations?
There is no need to speculate. Xi himself,
in his report, openly and boldly tells all who
will listen. China, he says, “has become a
great power in the world”. China’s global
engagement is proactive, confident and
growing. Economics and trade drive China’s
power, exemplified by the much-needed Belt
and Road Initiative, but diplomacy, the soft
power of culture and media, and the hard
power of a blue-water navy projecting power,
are developing rapidly.
As Xi said, the new era sees “China moving
closer to center stage and making greater
contributions to mankind”. The country is
now offering “Chinese wisdom” and “Chinese
solutions” to the international community —
the experiences and lessons of China’s
remarkable development, especially to developing
countries.
Regarding Taiwan, which exemplifies Chinese
sovereignty, Xi painted a bright red line.
“We will resolutely uphold national sovereignty
and territorial integrity and will never
tolerate a repeat of the historical tragedy of a
divided country,” Xi emphasized. “We have
firm will, full confidence, and sufficient capability
to defeat any form of Taiwan independence
secession plot.”
China has asserted again that it is no
threat to any country. No matter how powerful
China becomes, China’s leaders say it will
never seek hegemony or pursue expansionism.
Nonetheless, some foreigners remain
suspicious, wary of China’s long-term ambitions.
Who knows future circumstances, they
worry? Who knows how China may change?
Although I fear self-fulfilling prophecy, I am
encouraged that China appreciates such sensitivities
and works to build confidence.
The 19th Party Congress, especially Xi’s
report, is an epic narrative of what China has
accomplished, what China has yet to achieve,
and what China envisages as necessary to be
a great nation. Xi, now, carries the authority;
he also bears the burden.
Setting that new target date of 2035 for
China to achieve basic modernization, Xi
sees China as standing at a new historic
starting point and socialism with Chinese
characteristics as exploring new horizons.
China has entered a new era and the road
ahead leads, apparently, to great nation status
by 2050.

CHINA DAILY Wednesday, October 18, 2017 VIEWS 11
Five years on
Robert Lawrence Kuhn
Historical starting point for new stage of development
The 19th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China,
which begins on October 18, will
set the leadership and establish
the policies for the next five years, at least.
While Party national congresses are
always seminal events in the political life
of the country, there is reason to expect
that this congress will have even greater
and longer-reaching impact.
The context of the 19th
CPC National Congress is
the grand vision for China
presented by CPC
Central Committee General
Secretary Xi Jinping,
who is now the “core” of
Robert
Lawrence Kuhn
“the CPC Central Committee
and of the whole
Party”. It is an epic narrative
of what China has
remarkably achieved, what China has yet to
do, and what China envisages as necessary
to become a great nation.
Xi’s grand vision is famously expressed as
“the Chinese Dream”, described as “the
great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”,
which has personal and national implications.
It is specified by two overarching
goals: the two centenary goals of establishing
a moderately prosperous society by
2020 — the 100th anniversary of the CPC is
2021 — and establishing China as a “fully
modernized, socialist nation” by the 100th
anniversary of the People’s Republic of China
in 2049.
The first goal, which includes the total
elimination of extreme poverty in the country,
will likely be achieved within the fiveyear
term of the 19th CPC National
Congress. It is the second goal that is of special
interest at this time, because in drawing
the roadmap and formulating the policies
to achieve China’s mid-century goal, this
Congress may set the agenda for the next
30-plus years.
The CPC national congresses are the
highest authority of CPC governance and
decision-making. The CPC constitutional
provision of holding congresses every five
years was reaffirmed by Deng Xiaoping in
the early days of reform (in part to establish
order and collective responsibility after a
period of chaos and political vicissitudes),
and since 1982, Party congresses have been
held scrupulously on schedule.
The congresses establish the senior leadership
of the Party and hence the nation by
electing the CPC Central Committee, which
in turn elects all top Party positions, and
also the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection; review and assess the achievements
and challenges over the five years
since the previous Party Congress; set the
vision, goals and objectives, agenda and priorities
for the subsequent five years; revise
the Party constitution (to keep up with the
times); and project an image of unified purpose
and direction to engender national
confidence and commitment.
The review and assessment of the previous
five years and setting the agenda and
priorities for the subsequent five years are
formally presented in the Report, delivered
by the general secretary representing the
outgoing Central Committee and thus
reflecting the consensus view of the Party
leadership. Ratified by the congress (after
minor modifications), it becomes the guiding
document that drives policy for the
incoming Central Committee.
On the day following a congress, the first
plenum of the new 19th Central Committee
is convened to elect the Party’s new senior
leadership, including the Political Bureau,
the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau (to which, in essence, everything in
China reports), and the general secretary of
the Central Committee. Also approved are
the Central Military Commission (which
oversees the People’s Liberation Army), the
Secretariat (which runs Party daily operations),
and the head of the Central Commission
for Discipline Inspection.
The planning for the national Party Congress
follows similar patterns. Beginning
more than a year in advance, it involves
both formal and informal processes. The
formal process includes the election or
appointment of about 2,300 delegates
(2,280 delegates at the 19th National Congress)
from among the Party’s over 89 million
members, at all levels and in all sectors,
and the preparation of the Report via an
elaborate system of extensive research in
targeted areas (involving thousands of
experts), solicitation of broad input, drafts
(or sections) circulated to numerous Party
experts and officials for comments, and iterative
intense reviews by higher bodies and
senior leaders. In addition, smaller groups
are assigned the more sensitive tasks of
amending the Party constitution and recommending
candidates for the new Central
Committee and senior leadership positions.
Final decisions for this year’s congress, as
well as final edits of the Report, were made
at the Seventh Plenum of the 18th CPC Central
Committee, held on Oct 11 to 14, days
prior to the opening ceremony of the 19th
CPC National Congress.
To understand the position and role of
CPC Central Committee General Secretary
Xi at the 19th Party National Congress, we
should appreciate what it means for Xi to
be the core. It was in October 2016, at the
Sixth Plenum of the 18th CPC Central Committee,
that Xi was designated the “core” of
the CPC Central Committee and of the
entire Party. The appellation was an unambiguous
assertion that China requires
strong leadership to maintain stability and
ensure development given China’s unprecedented,
complex challenges: domestically,
slower growth, industrial overcapacity,
endemic pollution, unbalanced development,
income disparity, social injustice,
social service demands; and internationally,
regional conflicts, sluggish economies, volatile
markets, trade protectionism, ethnic
clashes, terrorism, geopolitical rivalries, and
territorial disputes.
Moreover, because China must deepen
reform to achieve the goal of being a moderately
prosperous society, the resistance of
entrenched interest groups must be overcome.
In fact, the necessity of having a leadership
core to maintain stability and
expedite reform was a primary factor relating
to Xi’s elevation to be the core.
In addition, not only does Xi have the
responsibility for China’s transformation;
he is also accountable for it. He has shown
courage in combating rampant practice of
graft, bribery and illicit patronage. Xi’s
relentless anti-corruption campaign is
altering how officials in government and
managers in industry work, and even how
they think. And let no one assume that Xi’s
battle against corruption has been risk-free.
Xi as the core does not change the Party’s
cardinal principle of “democratic centralism”.
The Party says it is encouraging the
democratic solicitation of input and feedback
from Party members, lower-ranked
officials, and the general public; and
strengthening centralism through Xi’s core
leadership.
In a complex world, given the diverse
interests and forces in Chinese society, the
Party asserts that the Chinese Dream cannot
be realized without unity. Strong leadership
is required to build and maintain unity
for China to continue its development.
When Xi received the core appellation, he
was already general secretary of the Party,
chairman of the Central Military Commission,
and president of the country — the
three highest leadership positions in China
— so how does being the “core” augment his
perceived stature or actual power?
The 2016 Party plenum communique
confirmed that “the collective leadership
system … must always be adhered to”.
Nonetheless, there must have been shifts in
terms of both the setting of the agenda and
making final decisions — or else making Xi
the core would have little meaning.
When foreigners dismiss the political
aphorisms of China’s leaders as simplistic
sloganeering, they miss an opportunity to
enrich their understanding. Chinese officials
certainly hold Xi’s frameworks in high
esteem.
Xi’s thought for the Party, the inner-Party
directives, include the “eight regulations”
(against waste and perks); “four self-confidences”
(in the country’s development path,
The China model, Xi
said, successful at home,
also broadens the way
for developing countries
to modernize, thus
providing Chinese
wisdom and Chinese
solutions for problems
facing mankind.
theories, systems, culture of socialism with
Chinese characteristics); opposing the “four
evil winds” (formalism, bureaucracy,
hedonism, decadence); the “four greats”
(struggles, projects, enterprises, dreams).
The combined intent is to make Party
members, especially Party and government
officials, more dedicated, committed, competent
and loyal, with exemplary moral
standards of probity and rectitude. It is no
small order.
The Party’s unremitting anti-corruption
campaign, unprecedented under Xi, has
won strong public support and will certainly
continue. But some foreign analysts mistakenly
see Xi’s anti-corruption campaign
as largely a tool of political power, thus
reflecting a superficial and one-dimensional
understanding of China. Befitting the size
and complexity of the country, for almost
every decision of importance, China’s leaders
have multiple motivations.
For the anti-corruption campaign, these
motivations include respect for the rule of
law and judicial impartiality; effective functioning
of the Party devoid of personal
interests; public trust in the Party; efficient
economic resource allocations (corruption
distorts markets); expediting reform (by
breaking up “interest groups” that resist
reform); maintaining national unity (by
removing officials with non-standard political
ambitions); elevating morality of Chinese
society; restoring ethical standards of
Chinese civilization; and facilitating China’s
emergence as a world-business center and
global role model.
Xi’s thought for the country — his new
ideas, new strategies, new initiatives set
forth over the past five years — can be
encapsulated as the overall vision of the
“Five in One” construction (economic, political,
cultural, social, ecological); governance
of the country via his “Four Comprehensives”
(a moderately prosperous society;
deepening reform, strengthening the rule of
law, strictly governing the Party); and
renewed economic development via the
Five Major Development Concepts (innovation,
coordination, green, open, sharing),
plus “supply-side structural reform”.
SHI YU / CHINA DAILY
Xi’s thought for national rejuvenation
includes a grand vision for global governance,
consisting of eight big diplomatic concepts:
a global community of shared destiny
and future; win-win cooperation; economic
globalization; fairer global governance; a
new kind of major power relationship;
expanding cooperation while managing differences;
multilateralism; and people-topeople
exchanges. Moreover, Xi’s Belt and
Road Initiative — facilitating economic
development in developing countries, especially
by building much-needed infrastructure
— is China’s “project of the century”.
China recognizes it has international
responsibilities and seeks to uphold a common,
comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable
security strategy. China’s own
requirement is to protect the country’s
three sacrosanct “core interests” — its political
system, economic development, and
national sovereignty (territorial integrity).
China appreciates that to be a major
country, with its political influence reflecting
its economic strength, and also to protect
its own core interests, its diplomacy
must be pro-active. China does not claim
that its “China model” can be adopted by
other countries, but the world should
understand Xi’s principles of governance as
optimally suited for China’s domestic conditions.
Party congresses have similar styles and
to casual observers, they can all seem much
the same. But they do have differences,
which are usually subtle and often meaningful.
For the 19th National Congress, some of
the things to look out for are:
Are political frameworks and policies
stated in their expected forms? If so, confidence
in political and economic stability is
reinforced.
How is General Secretary Xi Jinping’s status
as “core” further stressed, as expected?
Who are the members of the new Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau and
what are their portfolios?
Assuming the Party Constitution is
amended to include Xi’s new ideas, new
strategies, new initiatives, will they be given
an overarching label?
What is the composition of the new Central
Committee?
In listing the essential economic, political,
cultural, social and ecological policies,
are there shifts of emphasis that, however
nuanced, suggest changing priorities?
For deepening reform, surely stressed,
what targets are specified? For example,
what will be stated explicitly about Stateowned
enterprise reform?
Environmental protection is a high priority,
but what specific regulations and
enhanced enforcements distinguish the
fight against pollution under Xi from those
of previous congresses?
Many social areas will be highlighted —
for example, education, healthcare, rural
land reform, migrant worker residencies —
but do any stand out?
As already affirmed, the anti-corruption
campaign will continue, but will its intensity
or direction change in any manner, will it
be institutionalized? How will the forthcoming
National Supervisory Commission
work?
What is the relative prominence of military
reform and modernization?
What is the relative prominence of international
affairs, given the high-profile Belt
and Road Initiative and China’s intense,
pro-active diplomacy?
Forecasting the 19th CPC National Congress
is not all guesswork and triangulating
rumors. Following tradition, Xi offered to
Party leaders a preview of his Report.
Speaking on July 26, he outlined China’s
achievements since the previous national
congress: new concepts of development,
deepened reform, enhanced rule of law,
strengthened environmental protection,
and a more capable military.
China, Xi said, has, after suffering century-long
hardships and tribulations, taken
three historic leaps, from standing-up to
becoming better-off to becoming stronger.
Xi called for a comprehensive, strategic and
forward-looking action program, highlighting
the success and vitality of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, the increasing
strength of the Party, and China’s expanding
circle of friends in the international community.
In China, he stressed, political legitimacy
is founded on competence and
accomplishment.
Significantly, Xi asserted that China’s
development stands at a new historic starting
point and that socialism with Chinese
characteristics is entering a new development
stage. The CPC cannot rest on its laurels,
he stressed. The country faces daunting
challenges. He warned the Party against
self-satisfaction and blind optimism.
Xi’s comments resonated with his core
values and bear witness to his consistency.
In 2006, then Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi
told me that China should be proud of its
successes, but its “achievements should not
engender complacency”, adding “we need to
assess ourselves objectively”.
Preparing for the upcoming congress, Xi
recognizes that the people’s desire for a happier
life is stronger than ever. They want
better education, higher incomes, stable
jobs, reliable social insurance, higher quality
healthcare, more comfortable living conditions,
a more beautiful environment and
a richer cultural life.
And there has been an inflection point in
China’s international perspective, reflecting
the nation’s consequential global engagement.
The China model, Xi said, successful
at home, also broadens the way for developing
countries to modernize, thus providing
Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions for
problems facing mankind.
The influence of the 19th CPC National
Congress and the impact of Xi Jinping’s
thought seem for decades to come.

FORUM
CPC-led system a political innovation
Editor’s Note:
The Two Sessions, the annual meetings
of China’s top legislative and
advisory bodies, have been under
global spotlight for the past few
weeks. This year’s Two Sessions
are of extraordinary importance as
they have adopted the constitutional
amendments, restructured government
institutions and elected the new
national leadership. To understand
what the institutional changes mean
for China’s future, as well as the
policy agenda for the coming year,
Global Times (GT) Washingtonbased
correspondent Hu Zexi talked
to Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn (Kuhn)
who is a long-time China observer,
and author and editor of over 25
books. Kuhn has been invited to Beijing
to take a closer look at this year’s
Two Sessions.
GT: What kind of policy issues are
you following during the Two Sessions?
Kuhn: The proposed amendments
to the Constitution of the People’s
Republic of China give a road map
of areas deemed critical. Several
of the provisions strengthen the
stability, continuity and robustness of
governance. Beyond these, I looked for
any deviations from expectations, for
example, on State-owned enterprise
reform or local government financing.
I also looked for any reaction to the
increased push-back against China’s
rising global capabilities from certain
countries.
GT: In recent years, the Chinese government
has made more efforts to make
Two Sessions’ agenda better meet public
expectations. For example, the government
will cooperate with media websites
to conduct surveys
about top policy areas
that the public wants
the Two Sessions to
address. How do you
evaluate such efforts?
Kuhn: Irrespective of the nature of the
political system or ideology, transparency
in governance is the best way for
government to deliver effective, efficient
programs, and enhance credibility.
The Chinese government has been
striving to increase transparency, which
deserves praise.
The Two Sessions are a vehicle for
the government to communicate with
the people and engage them through
media in dealing with all the critical
issues.

2018
GT: How do you see the political belief
of China that democracy should meet the
real or fundamental needs of the public?
Kuhn: Government performance and
democracy are not the same.
The former is indeed assessed by
alleviating poverty, reducing pollution,
improving healthcare and the like.
Democracy is the public participation of
common people in the complex process
of governance.
Thus, true democracy is much
broader than one-person-one-vote.
It includes, primarily, the capacity to
provide substantive input on complex
Illustration: Liu Rui/GT
issues and to provide oversight in the
management of officials.
GT: China for long has argued that
democracy or any other political mechanism
should be developed on the basis
of a country’s specific condition. How do
you see this belief, as well as its practice?
Kuhn: Certainly, political systems differ,
even between countries that have
the same ideology. Nonetheless, there
are great commonalities in the goals
and objectives shared by all countries
and people. I suspect that over time,
measured in not less than decades and
perhaps even centuries, there will be
a convergence of
systems toward
what I call with a
smile, “Optimizationism”
– leaders,
officials, executives
making myriad decisions every day to
optimize outcomes without thinking of
the ideology.
GT: There’s talk about China’s unique
system of multiparty cooperation and
political consultation led by the Communist
Party of China (CPC) during the
Two Sessions. How do you observe this
system?
Kuhn: The benefits of a one-party-rule
are apparent: the coherence of policies,
rapid decision-making and formulation
of strategies that require long-term
consistency for long-term commitment.
But all systems of governance have
trade-offs, and two challenges of oneparty-rule
are assuring that all rational
points of view, including dissenting
ones, are included in the decision-making
process; and systemic checks and
balances for oversight of officials at all
levels of government.
China’s system of multi-party cooperation
and consultation, led by the
CPC, is a political innovation in including
inputs and ideas from diverse segments
of society, while still maintaining
harmony of spirit and consistency in
policies. But because of its scale and
power, the CPC, which is the ruling
party, has a higher obligation to pay
attention to other parties and voices. A
true democracy is measured by how the
majority treats the minority.
GT: As a decades-long observer of China,
what do you think the constitutional
amendment will bring to the country?
Kuhn: This constitutional amendment
is all about strengthening China’s
system of governance, especially the
Party’s leadership of the country and
President Xi Jinping’s leadership of the
Party and the nation.
Going by the whiplash of Western
reactions, one could be forgiven for assuming
that the amendment is all about
abolishing term limits of the president
and vice president. In fact, there are 21
clauses in the constitutional amendment
and to understand where China
is going, one must gauge the meaning
and intent of all of them.
Xi has been consistent in respecting,
indeed in championing, China’s
Constitution, and by now amending it,
he underscores the congruity between
the realities of how China is governed
and what the Constitution says – thus
bolstering Xi’s commitment to the Rule
of Law.
Establishing the National Supervisory
Law and Commissions, expanding
the anti-corruption campaign to all
public organs and organizations, reaffirms
Xi’s commitment to enhancing
the rule of law.
As for term limits, it is not that Xi
will hold the formal titles of leadership
for life, but that he will hold real
leadership long enough to bring about
China’s national rejuvenation and establish
Chinese type democratic norms.
All factors considered, because of
China’s special conditions and Xi’s special
capabilities, abolishing term limits
may be good for China. It is commonly
said that China’s system of governance
can ensure stability and consistency,
which is a necessary requirement
for advancing reform.
GT: What do you see as the underlying
reason for the institutional
restructuring of the government
passed during the Two Sessions?
Kuhn: The sweeping restructuring
of the Chinese government
streamlines the bureaucracy,
eliminates institutional conflicts
of interest between government
bodies, aligns authority with
responsibility, and, significantly,
enhances the leadership of the
Party in the management as well
as the oversight of the government.
Although the restructuring
has multiple motivations, a
prime driver is to support China’s
continuing development under
complex conditions – a slowing
economy, uncertain financial risk,
unacceptable pollution, the special
demands of innovation.
Given China’s challenges at
home and abroad the government
restructure is timely. Some media
outlets describe it as a “reshuffle,”
as if the random rearrangement of
a deck of cards. I beg to differ.
This restructuring is as deliberate as
it is far-reaching – and planned precisely
to address a host of contradictions.
The outcome is to strengthen CPC’s
leadership throughout the country. In
fact, deepening reform is now defined,
for state as well as for Party institutions,
as strengthening the CPC’s leadership
in every sector. The aim is consistency
and uniformity in implementing policy.
The announcement of the restructuring
followed swiftly after the adoption
by the National People’s Congress
of the constitutional amendment, and
although both were long in the works,
their rapid-fire sequence serves to underscore
the preeminence of President
Xi in setting the new agenda, and the
power of the Party in implementing the
new policies.
GT: Environment has always been a
heated topic at the Two Sessions. How
do you see the prospect of green development
in China?
Kuhn: I have been following China’s
environmental problems for over two
decades, and until recent years under
President Xi. While officials would of
course decry pollution, it only became
progressively worse. Companies flouted
the law. The minuscule fines were a
small price for not worrying about the
cost of controlling pollution. Officials
were loath to risk impeding economic
growth. Today is dramatically different.
President Xi has raised ecology and
environment to the highest category of
national priorities. Ecological progress
is among the five top goals (along with
economic, political, cultural and social
progress). Green is the third of the New
(Five Major) Concepts of Development.
The change in attitudes toward pollution
is stunning. For example, fines for
corporate pollution now hurt.

Core strength
Robert Lawrence Kuhn says those who see China’s designation of Xi Jinping as core leader to be a variation
of strongman rule misunderstand its significance for a people navigating their way through huge challenges
When, at a recent
party plenum,
President Xi Jinping
(���) was
designated as
“core” of the Communist Party’s
Central Committee, some Western
media were quick to condemn the
rise of a new “strongman”. While
recognising the significance of Xi as
the core was correct, conjuring up
visions of an emerging dictator was
not.
I recalled my meeting with Xi
years earlier, when he was still party
secretary of Zhejiang (��) province.
Even then he was criticising
“empty talk” and advising, “We
should never overestimate our
accomplishments or indulge ourselves
in our achievements”.
I took note of how Xi stressed,
“We need to assess ourselves objectively”.
Hardly, in retrospect, the
ruminations of a gestating dictator.
To understand why Xi is now the
core, one must appreciate the
complex challenges of our times.
China is now facing multiple challenges:
domestically – slow growth,
industrial overcapacity, endemic
pollution, imbalanced development,
income disparity, social
injustice, social service demands;
and, internationally – wars, regional
conflicts, sluggish economies, volatile
markets, trade protectionism,
ethnic clashes, terrorism, geopolitical
rivalries, and territorial disputes
in the South and East China seas.
Most critically, because China
must deepen its reforms to achieve
its oft-promised goal of a “moderately
prosperous society” by 2020,
the resistance of entrenched interest
groups must be overcome. More
subtly, there is what some call a
pervasive “soft resistance” – local
officials who do not do their job and
economic elites who migrate.
If reform had been progressing
smoothly, then why strengthen
central authority by investing Xi
with the status of core leader? Xi has
encountered obstacles; if there
were no obstacles, there would be
no need for a core leader.
I have been speaking to party
officials and theorists about Xi as
core leader. In fact, the necessity of
having a leadership core to maintain
stability and expedite reform is
the first and foremost of what I
found to be four factors relating to
Xi’s elevation.
A second factor is that not only
does Xi have the responsibility for
China’s transformation, he is also
accountable for it. Moreover, he has
shown courage in confronting and
dismantling a vast, corrupt system
of bribery, patronage and illicit
wealth accretion.
A third factor is that Xi as the core
does not end, and even may not di-
minish, the cardinal principle of
Xi Jinping as
core leader is
more a ratification
of reality than
a shift of
fundamentals
Bring down the curtain on this idiotic political drama
If you’re tired of all the politics, I
feel you. It’s draining, to say the
least, especially when the
melodrama in Hong Kong is
dragging out; it has become
downright dreadful when we know
there is no respite in sight.
We were supposed to have a
brief break after last September’s
Legislative Council polls, before the
next big event. Even though a large
number of people will be unable to
cast a vote in the Election
Committee subsector elections,
less than a month away, and in the
chief executive election, scheduled
for late March next year, the city
should by now be focusing on
what’s ahead.
But, thanks to the two recently
disqualified lawmakers, who lacked
the necessary knowledge, ability
and respect for oath-taking, our
(albeit dysfunctional) legislature
has basically been shut down for a
month. The ugly politics that
should have been insulated within
“democratic centralism”. The party
bolsters each of the concepts:
encouraging the democratic solicitation
of input and feedback from
members, lower-ranked officials,
and the public; and strengthening
centralism through Xi’s leadership
of the principal levers of power (his
positions as party general secretary,
head of state, chairman of the
Central Military Commission, and
head of the “leading groups” on
reform, national security and internet
security).
A fourth factor is that a core is
required to manage the party more
strictly and thereby give members
and the public more confidence.
Witness Xi’s relentless and unprecedented
anti-corruption campaign,
which is altering how government
officials and industry managers
work and even think. Let no one
assume that Xi’s battle against
corruption has been risk-free.
Significantly, these four factors
undergirding Xi as the core leader
map onto his overarching political
framework, his strategic blueprint
called “The Four Comprehensives”
– a moderately prosperous society,
reform, rule of law, party discipline.
Xi’s core status arises, we’re told,
through the collective will of the
party and the people. Becoming
party core is not an automatic
consequence of being general secretary;
a core leader must fit the
times and the status must be
earned.
Speaking at a press conference
following the 18th Central Committee’s
sixth plenum last month,
Huang Kunming (���), executive
vice-minister of the committee’s
Publicity Department, said that the
“central and local departments as
well as the military all expressed
their support” for Xi’s position as
party core, adding that this decision
Alice Wu has had enough of the brouhaha over the
oath-taking by two lawmakers. Now that they’ve
been disqualified, HK must focus on battles ahead
the chamber once again spilled out
onto our streets.
And what should have been
decided and concluded on
September 4 is now dragging on
indefinitely, with two or possibly
more by-elections added to the
election overload.
Hell-raising politics is not going
away any time soon, but the sheer
stupidity of the localist pair’s
actions really is one for the books –
Macbeth, in fact:
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and
tomorrow, / Creeps in this petty pace
from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded
time, / And all our yesterdays have
lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out,
was “based on the valuable experience
of the party and we feel keenly
about it”.
Huang explained that “a core is
needed to ensure that the party will
be the governing party”, describing
it as significant for upholding the
Central Committee’s authority and
maintaining the central, unified
leadership of the party and for its
“staying true to its mission”.
Therefore, party theorists
explain, Xi as core leader is more a
ratification of reality than a shift of
fundamentals.
What does Xi as core mean in a
historical context? It was Deng
Xiaoping (���) who introduced
the concept when he designated
Jiang Zemin (���) as “core of the
third generation” of central leaders,
bolstering Jiang’s stature following
his unexpected appointment as
party leader in 1989. At the time,
China was facing the dual impediments
of economic stagnation and
social uncertainty at home, and
economic quarantine and diplomatic
isolation abroad. As Deng
pointed out: “Any leading group
should have a core; a leadership
with no core is unreliable.”
Only then did Deng retrospectively
apply the novel term to Mao
Zedong (���) and to himself, as
core of the first and second generations,
respectively. (Of course,
Mao was so utterly dominant that
calling him core during his lifetime
would have seemed a demotion.
Deng remained core even when he
no longer held any official position.)
Today’s world is more complex.
China faces threats at home and
abroad. Volatility grows and uncertainty
abounds – the Middle East
and Donald Trump are offered as
evidence. The need to secure
China’s stability is more essential
than ever, and thus to strengthen
brief candle! / Life’s but a walking
shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour
upon the stage / And then is heard
no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound
and fury, / Signifying nothing.
They were indeed full of sound
and fury, and they did nothing for
the common good.
What they did opened the door
for an invitation to the courts to
intervene. What they did presented
an opportunity for an
interpretation of the Basic Law by
the National People’s Congress
Standing Committee.
What they did, ultimately, may
well become the precedent for
other legislators to be similarly
Xi’s authority is a primary reason,
I’m told, for designating Xi as core
leader. Party theorists say China
“urgently” requires a political nucleus
that is sophisticated and
nuanced, attuned to contemporary
times. Though conditions now
differ from those in 1989, Deng’s
admonition rings timelessly true.
However, that a core leader is
needed now does not mean one will
always be needed. When China
becomes a fully modernised nation,
perhaps by mid-century, condi-
tions may change again.
True loyalty is
telling leadership
in private what
one really
believes is in their
best interests
I hear frequently of the “painful
lessons of China’s century of blood
and tears” and that for China not to
have a tested and authoritative
leadership core would be “unthinkable”.
Party inner talk says “Xi
Jinping has passed the test of the
people” to be China’s political core,
leadership core, and a core of the
times.
Chinese scholars argue that
“core” is a unique characteristic of
Chinese political theory – however
inapplicable (even inexplicable) in
Western political theory. They call
Western concerns that Xi as core
leader means that “a new emperor
is born” wildly unfounded, even
paranoic. In feudal society, the
emperor ruled unconditionally
barred. And that is why the duo’s
pledge to spend every penny – and
lest we forget, this also means the
mounting cost to the public purse –
to “appeal at all costs” is beyond
rich, coming from them.
Clearly, they have yet to wrap
their heads around the concept of
“personal responsibility”. Sixtus
Baggio Leung Chung-hang is
wrong in believing that their
disqualification from Legco
rendered the election meaningless.
They have no one but themselves
to blame for their defenestration. It
is they who made the election
meaningless.
And, to add insult to the grave
injury they brought on the rest of
us, they are asking for donations. At
some point – if we’re not there
already – we must take serious
offence to be taken as fools, again
and again. The curtain must now
be drawn on this overly played-out
second act.
The irony may be lost on the
with arbitrary imperial power, and
in such a “command-obey” system,
goes the argument, there is simply
no need for a core.
Rather, given today’s party political
structure, the concept of a core
both strengthens cohesion and
serves to prevent a personality cult,
not to promote one. Having a core
means acknowledging that the
party system is not the “emperor
system” – absolute power is rejected
– and that the optimum system, at
least for the foreseeable future, is a
combination of concentrated centralism
and democratic collective
leadership.
Corroborating this functional
balance, in the communiqué issued
following the sixth plenum, the
“collective leadership system” is
reconfirmed. It states: “The implementation
of collective leadership
and personal division of labour is an
important component of democratic
centralism and must always
be adhered to.” And it stresses: “Any
organisation or individual shall,
under any circumstance, not be
allowed to violate this system for
any reason.” The three “any’s” seem
no accident.
Some analysts see contradictions.
On the one hand, the
communiqué calls for democracy
and constructive criticism internally
within the party. On the other,
disobeying the central leadership is
forbidden, backed by vigilant
supervision and tough discipline.
Yet to read these statements as
contradictory is to misunderstand
what is happening here. Xi appreciates
the complex and arduous tasks
that lie ahead. He told me so a
decade ago, and it is obviously truer
today than it was then. The statements
are harmonised, first, by the
party’s motivation to seek optimum
policies for the country, and second,
by keeping most of the divergent
views internal.
True loyalty is telling leadership
in private what one really believes is
in their best interests, not pandering
and fawning by repeating what one
thinks leadership wants to hear.
Though there are concerns, no one
here worries that Xi will become
Mao.
China is now the world’s largest
trading nation and its second-largest
economy. China’s diplomacy is
expanding and its military is growing.
From its Belt and Road initiative
building infrastructure and facilitating
trade in over 60 developing
countries to its leading role in the
UN peacekeeping forces, China, the
“Middle Kingdom”, is involved in
every meaningful matter of international
affairs.
So, what kind of China do we
want? Certainly not one with weak
central leadership and fragmented
citadels of power. With its huge and
imbalanced population, and its
diverse culture and traditions,
China today requires a leader with
sufficient strength and prestige to
secure social stability, drive economic
reform, and guide it in being
a responsible world power. Xi as
core leader should be good for
China and, thus, for the world.

been played for total fools. In case
they haven’t noticed, the
lawmakers who served as the duo’s
chaperones have stopped
babysitting them because there is
no value in being their keepers any
more. Escorting the duo’s Legco
gate-crashing attempts served their
purpose: to usher the two straight
to their political end, and the votes

now political spoils.
The two took the toxic brew and

contest their seats.

The basic law
of unintended
consequences
Mike Rowse says the continuing
political tussles in HK illustrate the
pain of being caught in a cycle of
actions and reactions, and we must
address the root cause of the grievances
There has been a considerable focus recently on
the Basic Law and the rule of law, and their
interaction. Perhaps neglected in the process has
been a different but relevant concept: the law of
unintended consequences, whereby an action gives
rise to outcomes unforeseen by the instigator.
Hong Kong’s tortuous path towards political reform
is a case in point. The first reference to the idea of
universal suffrage for selection of the chief executive
comes in Article 45 of the Basic Law, promulgated back
in 1990. Looking towards 1997, its purpose was to
reassure. Naturally, attention turned to the subject in
the early part of this century. While people understood
that the move towards universal suffrage had to be in
accordance with the “principle of gradual and orderly
progress”, the reform package put forward in 2014 was
widely perceived as disappointing; the plan to stick
with an unrepresentative nominating committee
deciding who could enter the race was unpalatable.
The State Council’s white paper on the governance
of Hong Kong, intended to set things straight, only
stirred things up and led to the Occupy Central
protests. The government let the action linger, hoping
public anger would pay dividends in the 2016
Legislative Council election. While the 79 days of
disruption did bring the protesters momentary
opprobrium, memories quickly faded. In the election,
the pro-government share of the vote actually fell, and
the attack on the idea of independence led directly to a
near 20 per cent share of the vote for a localist faction.
This was surely not the objective.
Now the government is trying to overturn the
election outcome. The practice of banning some
potential candidates from standing, then using all
means at hand to unseat some of those elected, is a
tactic more usually associated with third-world
countries following a military coup.
Has something been lost in
translation here? Perhaps
we need an interpretation
of the interpretation
In the short term, the judicial review sought by the
chief executive against the decision by Legco president
Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen to give Sixtus Baggio Leung
Chung-hang and Yau Wai-ching another opportunity
to take the oath has been successful. Mr Justice
Thomas Au Hing-cheung ruled in the High Court that
their oaths were invalid, they should not be given a
second chance and their positions should immediately
be vacated. Many observers thought he might decline
to rule at all, and simply refer the matter back to the
Legco president. The problem with one arm of the
administration delving too deeply into the processes of
another is that it inevitably generates more requests to
do so. And, sure enough, we now have legal challenges
against more legislators, plus a challenge against the
chief executive himself.
Given that, in the past, other Legco members who
had politicised their swearing-in and then done it
properly second time round were permitted to take up
their seats, did Leung and Yau have a “legitimate
expectation” that they would enjoy similar treatment?
The Legco president certainly thought so, hence his
original ruling. Now it is for a higher court to decide.
Meanwhile, the National People’s Congress
Standing Committee has sought to clarify Article 104 of
the Basic Law, which requires all people concerned to
“swear to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
special administrative region of the People’s Republic
of China and swear allegiance” to it. But the
interpretation is different: it talks of “a legal pledge … to
the People’s Republic of China and its Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region” (emphasis added). Has
something been lost in translation here? Perhaps we
need an interpretation of the interpretation.
If, at the end of the day, there are two (or more)
vacant Legco seats, then we are in by-election territory.
I don’t think the people are fooled for one minute
about what is going on. In each constituency, an
impeccable opposition candidate will stand, win a
majority, and take the oath impeccably. Unfortunately,
this tragedy – or farce – will continue until the
government starts to address the underlying
grievances over the lack of meaningful political reform
instead of just hammering the symptoms, which
generates new grievances in the process.

Looming tech war
Robert Lawrence Kuhn says the ZTE showdown points to a misunderstanding over motives
As someone who works for US-
China understanding and
roots for US-China partnerships,
I’ve been concerned, but
not worried, over what others
have called “a looming trade war”. I’ve not
worried because tariffs don’t work; they are
blunt instruments in a globalised economy,
penalising American companies and
consumers as much as Chinese. Most
American experts oppose tariffs, and President
Donald Trump likes to make big deals
after making big threats.
But I am now worried over what I will
call “a looming tech war”, because the
structural imperatives go deeper.
As everyone who follows China knows,
the US Department of Commerce has imposed
a denial of export privileges
against ZTE, China’s second-largest telecommunications
equipment manufacturer,
thus prohibiting US companies from
selling essential electronic components
and software to ZTE, a crippling sanction.
China has responded resolutely, with
actions that seem selected from expert scenario
planning, and with rhetoric, both indignation
and nationalistic bravado.
From China’s perspective, according to
its Ministry of Commerce, “If the United
States attempts to curb China's development
… it miscalculates. The action targets
China; however, it will ultimately undermine
the US itself,” affecting tens of thousands
of jobs and hundreds of related US
enterprises.
“Targeting technology is like throttling
the neck of the Chinese enterprises,”
wrote China Daily. “The ZTE case should
remind China's decision-makers of the
urgency to become self-sufficient in core
technologies.”
President Xi Jinping has been prescient
about domestic control of core technologies,
especially related to the internet and
more recently to artificial intelligence.
Since taking office in 2012, he has stressed
the “hidden risks” that come with core
technologies not being mastered domestically.
He said, “Heavy dependence on imported
core technology is like building our
house on top of someone else's walls: no
matter how big and how beautiful it is, it
won’t remain standing during a storm.”
Innovation is the first of Xi’s “five major
concepts of development”.
Beijing also claims
that the country itself
is a victim of
discriminatory
policies
From the US perspective, according to
its Department of Commerce, the prohibition
against ZTE is punishment for ZTE violating
US sanctions against Iran and North
Korea, making false statements and obstructing
justice, and then after reaching a
settlement agreement, violating it.
The United States claims it is not resisting
China’s rise, but rather the country’s
unfair or illegal means to achieve it. The US
action enumerated four such practices as
rationale for imposing punitive tariffs, all
relating to technology or intellectual property:
foreign firms in China are required to
form joint ventures and transfer knowledge,
as well as license technology with
below-market terms and conditions, while
the state supports Chinese enterprises in
acquiring foreign hi-tech assets, and sanctions
commercial cyber theft.
President Trump is wildly unpopular
among American elites, especially among
policy experts, who do not need much of an
excuse to criticise him – note the fusillade of
attacks on Trump’s tariffs. But these elites
are not criticising Trump on US moves to
counter what they, with unusual consensus,
perceive to be China’s unfair policies,
and in some cases unlawful programmes,
to become a world leader in state-of-the-art
technologies, especially AI, information
technology, robotics, advanced manufacturing,
new energy vehicles, aviation and
biotechnology.
China claims that it is still a developing
country, so different rules apply, a foundational
principle of the World Trade Organisation.
Beijing also claims that the country
itself is a victim of discriminatory policies
restricting its imports of hi-tech products.
Of course, China had to respond with
appropriate actions as well as confident
words, imposing heavy tariffs on US
sorghum and signalling that additional
agricultural tariffs were at the ready, along
with barely veiled threats against US companies
operating in China.
Here’s my fear. While I have argued that
most mainstream American experts are not
motivated to impede China’s rise, as many
in China believe, I can no longer make that
argument persuasive.
In the US, there has been a dark turn
among experts that US policy towards
China, calibrated over four decades to
shepherd China’s rise, has failed: China,
they have come to believe, has become a
competitor and may become an adversary,
and that US relations with China must now
be managed as with an emergent adversary,
not as with a developing partner.
In China, nationalistic voices are on the
rise, castigating the US for its self-serving
motivation to impede China’s rise, and calling
for China to become more self-reliant,
more rapidly, especially in world-class
semiconductors, so that the country would
not be vulnerable to US “blackmail”.
Welcome to the unhappy world of selffulfilling
prophecy, where the actions of
each side in response to a perceived threat
from the other side increases the likelihood
of that threat morphing from theoretical to
actual.
To both sides, I offer two pieces of
advice. First, take a breath and a fresh look,
because the road on which you are travelling
will not lead to a happy place.
Second, contemplate why the other side
is misinterpreting your actions. To my
American friends, what makes China think
the US is resisting its rise? To my Chinese
friends, what makes the US think that
China is a competitor and may become an
adversary?
Projecting malevolent motives and seeing
sinister conspiracies is the easy way out.
It can solicit cheers and plaudits in one’s
domestic media, but it will impede progress
and is likely to be self-defeating.
The US and China must each figure out
how not to confirm the other’s self-fulfilling
prophecy.

Older people still
have lot to offer
in the workplace
Paul Yip says measures to ensure
Hong Kong retirees remain active
through employment may help
prevent poverty and partially offset
the impact of a declining birth rate
Employment is the most robust method for
keeping people out of poverty. In Hong Kong’s
latest poverty situation report, for those with a
job, the poverty rate is only 12.3 per cent, compared to
77.4 per cent among those not working. Among older
adults with a job, it is 12.9 per cent, compared with 48.2
per cent among those without employment.
Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung has
recently raised the possibility of promoting workforce
participation for those aged 50-64 and helping those
aged 65-74 re-enter the job market. Hong Kong’s
workforce participation rate among older adults is 17.7
per cent, lower than in Japan (22.7 per
cent), Singapore (26.8 per cent) and Seoul (31.5 per
cent).
The Japanese government has been very active in
promoting workforce participation among its older
citizens, especially since 27 per cent of its
population was aged 65 or over as of 2017. The
population size has decreased, from 128 million in
2010 to 127 million in 2015, and the United
Nations estimates that the number will continue to fall
until 2061. The number of migrants moving to the
country has not offset the population decrease, leaving
no choice but to improve the labour participation and
productivity rate, especially among older adults and
married women with children.
Though Hong Kong’s total fertility rate is only 1.2
per woman – less than the 1.4 in Japan – we have
benefited from migration from the mainland to keep
our population young. Our life expectancy is also very
similar to Japan’s, at 81 for men and 87 for women. It is
time to explore how to make better use of our older
The most important thing is
to provide an option for
older adults to be active in
the job market
Greater effort is required to foster gender diversity
Kevin Sneader and Anu Madgavkar say the Asia-Pacific region needs more women leaders
Women’s representation in highranking
positions in business
and politics is a global issue, but
an even more pressing one in Asia-Pacific.
Across the region, only one in five people in
leading roles is a woman.
This waste of women’s talent comes at
an economic cost. Many economies in the
region are ageing and skills shortages are
on the rise: making more of women’s
potential can help meet such challenges.
Businesses gain a great deal from
supporting women. McKinsey’s 2018
report “The Power of Parity” found that
companies in the top quarter for gender
diversity on their executive teams are 21
per cent more likely to experience aboveaverage
profitability.
Even in developed economies in the
Asia-Pacific, few women are getting to
the top in business – in Japan, there are no
female CEOs in the top 100 public
companies. In Australia and Singapore, the
share of women CEOs in 2016 was only 6
per cent and 5 per cent respectively. The
Philippines, a traditionally matriarchal
society whose government has been
proactive in tackling gender inequality,
does better in senior positions overall, but
only 3 per cent of CEOs and 15 per cent of
board members are women.
The lower share of women in leading
positions within companies isn’t all about
the glass ceiling – the point at which
women’s careers appear to halt. Rather,
women’s under-representation has its
roots as far back as the education system.
In India, only 44 per cent of students in
tertiary education are female and many
graduates don’t take up employment: only
25 per cent of entry-level positions in
Indian companies are taken by women. In
Japan, the share of women enrolled in
college is higher, at 47 per cent, but women
were only 28 per cent of students attending
the top 10 universities.
The share of women erodes sharply
from entry-level to the boardroom, and the
biggest “breakpoint” is motherhood. In a
2015 McKinsey survey, 45 per cent of Asian
executives cited the “anywhere, anytime”
performance model as the largest barrier
to women moving into senior roles. In
Japan, a survey found that three-quarters
of women respondents said they were not
interested in managerial positions, partly
because promotion would mean working
even longer hours.
The second most cited factor behind
women dropping out of work is the
“double burden” of holding down a job
while looking after the family. In China, 33
per cent of female respondents to a 2017
survey said that they had a lower salary
when they returned to work after having a
baby, and 36 per cent said they had to
accept a demotion. Sixty-three per cent
said they did not want a second child
because this would hurt their career.
Many women struggle to return to work
because childcare options are limited or
too expensive. In Australia, net childcare
costs (paid by two-earner families) were 20
per cent of an average family’s income in
2015, compared with the 13 per cent
average in OECD economies.
The attrition of women from the talent
pipeline starts even earlier than
motherhood, as societal attitudes militate
against women pursuing a career and
prioritise looking after families. In India, 70
per cent of respondents to the 2010-2014
World Values Survey agreed with the
statement, “When a mother works for pay,
the children suffer.”
More can be done to
give women the
freedom to choose a
career as well as
motherhood
There has been some progress. The
share of women on company boards has
been rising, reflecting efforts by both
governments and private-sector
organisations. India has made it
mandatory for companies to have at least
one female director, and the Australian
Securities Exchange Corporate
Governance Council tracks gender
diversity in its constituent companies.
Japanese pharmaceutical company
Takeda hit its target of 30 per cent of new
managers being women (from only 6.2 per
cent in 2015) through a range of initiatives
including flexible working hours.
However, there is much more that can
be done to give women the freedom to
choose a career as well as motherhood.
Narrowing the leadership gender gap will
require concerted action by governments
and companies from encouraging and
helping girls to learn the right skills for a
changing labour market and mentoring
women in their careers, to shifting
attitudes towards women’s roles through
public-awareness campaigns to – perhaps
most importantly – making work flexible.
More help with childcare is urgently
needed. Governments can use public
spending to expand childcare provision
and companies can set up nurseries.
Flexible working practices in companies
are vital. In Australia, financial services
company Suncorp enables flexible
working through “work at home hubs” that
combine home work stations and working
spaces in regional shopping centres.
Such efforts are only likely to be
effective with a root-and-branch shift in
attitudes towards women’s roles in society.
Governments can lead from the front,
setting targets for women’s representation
in business as Japan and Singapore have
done, and more companies can push for
true diversity within their ranks. Doing so is
not only in the interests of their bottom line
but the health of the economies in which
they work.

adults. We should create the right environment
for raising the retirement age and extending
employment beyond that age. Some issues, like
excessive health and medical insurance costs for the
older workforce, and long working hours, should be
re-examined.
The government can create a fund to protect
against excessive increases in insurance costs, while
introducing a more flexible working arrangement for
the older workforce.
The most important thing is to provide an option
for older adults to be active in the job market, and give
them the choice of whether to continue in a job. Those
who have had enough could perhaps take on volunteer
work in the community. For those who stay on with
paid employment, more flexible time arrangements
would better suit their needs, while their roles could be
redefined so as not to stand in the way of the career
advancement of younger workers. Some tangible
support might be needed for the business sector,
ideally through a tax-deductible arrangement rather
than the proposed cash support.
For some work, such as in teaching and research,
the situation depends on individual ability. As in
overseas countries, participants should be allowed to
work as long as they meet expectations. At present, a
vigorous review process takes place to determine
whether to extend beyond retirement age.
The education levels of Hong Kong’s older adults is
not high and, among those with very low levels, most
can only find work in low-skilled jobs such as cleaning
and security duties. Nevertheless, these areas face a
shortage of labour and can be a good fit. In such cases,
people’s rights and pay should be better protected, to
avoid companies exploiting this group of workers.
Also, sometimes, older adults are not driven by
money when seeking work. For some, finding meaning
in their work can be sufficient. The Japanese
experience shows that some older adults continue to
work to maintain their independence and fitness. Such
workers, whatever they do, display high levels of
professionalism.
Respecting the wishes of older adults and providing
a quality choice in terms of working would be a winwin
situation for the whole community.
Paul Yip is chair professor (Population Health) in the
Department of Social Work and Social Administration at the
University of Hong Kong
For some, finding meaning in work is important, as with
these women who recycle used clothes to make bags.

CNN’S AMANPOUR – May 29, 2013
President Xi Jinping to meet President Barack Obama
Interview with Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn,
long-time adviser to China’s leaders.

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN HOST: Good evening.
I'm Christiane Amanpour. There may officially be only one
superpower today, but another is rapidly advancing. The
United States and China jockey for position at the pinnacle of
the world in what might just be called a race to the top. So
how will the first tete-a-tete go between their leaders, the two
most powerful men on Earth, U.S. President Barack Obama
and China's leader, Xi Jinping, will meet just over a week
from now in an informal setting at the aptly named
Sunnylands Estate just outside Los Angeles. China is
anxious and angry about Obama's much-touted “pivot” to
Asia and about what China perceives to be the U.S. siding
with Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea. The
United States, for its part, has a laundry list of concerns,
everything from alleged Chinese hacking of even its most
sensitive military secrets to its influence over North Korea
and Pyongyang's nuclear saber-rattling. President Xi says the
U.S.-China relationship is at a crucial juncture and he says
that he wants to forge, a new type of great power
relationship. So what exactly will that look like? We need
to know because this may just be the most important
relationship in the world today. And in a moment, I will dig
deeper with Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a long-time adviser to
China's leaders.
AMANPOUR: Robert Lawrence Kuhn has tremendous
insight into China's leaders. He's a long-time adviser to the
Chinese government; he's met President Xi several times and
he's the author of the book, How China's Leaders Think.
That is a big title. Welcome to the studio.

“Xi Jinping: The Governance of China”
Robert Lawrence Kuhn
October 5, 2014
FZ: What in the world is the leader of the second
largest economy on the planet thinking? That’s a
question many would love to know the answer to,
but in a closed, secretive society, like China, it’s
all but impossible to know. He rarely gives
interviews, and the press in China is far from free.
But now we have something to look at. Chinese
President Xi Jinping has a new book, entitled The
Governance of China, and it’s aiming for
worldwide impact. State media there reports that
the book has been published in nine languages:
Chinese, English, French, Russian, Arabic,
Spanish, Portuguese, German and Japanese.
My next guest, Robert Lawrence Kuhn, says it is a
milestone. Kuhn has advised the Chinese
government for twenty-­‐five years, and is the
author of How China’s Leaders Think. Welcome.
KUHN: Pleasure to be here.
FZ: First, give us a sense of who this man is for
our viewers. Who is Xi Jinping, and why is he a
little different from China’s ordinary leaders?
KUHN: Xi Jinping has been involved in all aspects
of what makes China today. His father was one of
the founders of the country, truly a great
revolutionary and a great reformer in the early
days. Xi Jinping graduated from Tsinghua
University [‘China’s MIT’], with a degree in
chemical engineering. Then he went through
more than two decades working at the local level.
Starting in a county, and then a city, Xiamen,
working his way up for many years in Fujian
province, becoming the governor. Then for five
years Xi was the Party Secretary of, the number
one official responsible for, Zhejiang province,
which is the center of entrepreneurship in China.
So that gives him a great sense of business. And
that was when I first met Xi Jinping, actually, in
2005, and then again in 2006, seeing him doing
the real work of running a province, a local area.
President Xi is a person, when you see him, who
is unassuming; he’s big, he has a strong presence
in a room, but you feel very comfortable with
him. He doesn’t put on airs, he’s very warm and

China’s Economy & Politics
President Xi’s ‘Four Comprehensives’
August 25, 2015
HOST: Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn is an advisor to the
Chinese government and author of How China’s
Leaders Think and he joins me now from Beijing. A
cut in interest rates today - but in China any economic
decision is always colored with politics.
RLK: Certainly people are concerned here, but you
have to realize a 43% drop in the Shanghai stock
market is still 25% above its 52-week lows, so what
the economists, government, tries to do is to
distinguish between the so-called real economy and
the stock market. Most people realize China’s stock
market was overvalued, but perception is reality, and
if people have less money on paper, they’ll spend less,
and so the fall will affect the real economy.
And you’re right, the way to look at such situations in
China is not just economically - you can’t look at
China without looking at politics, and here there are
two major areas. One is President Xi Jinping’s state
visit to Washington. This has been a very tense time
in Sino-US relations: South China Sea, cybersecurity,
human rights, lots of issues. But what this economic
uncertainty and volatility will do - I hope - is to make
both presidents focus on what really affects human
beings and human lives, focus on economic areas,
because this is where there can be some commonality
between China and the US. The contentious issues are
real, but economics is more real for people.
Domestically in China, it’s really interesting, because
in recent days, there have been editorials in People’s
Daily talking about extreme resistance to reform and
older leaders who are still involved and maybe
shouldn’t be, and so you have to look at domestic
politics in terms of what Xi Jinping, who is China’s
dominant leader, the president of the country, head
of the party, head of the military, and other titles as
well, and what his overarching policy is.
It’s called the “Four Comprehensives.” We learn from
each one. The first says that China wants to build a
‘moderately prosperous society’. That’s their shortterm
goal. It’s not different than others have said in

BEIJING, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping, with an engaging and creative diplomatic
approach, is likely to secure a big success in his visit to the United States later this month, said U.S.
expert Robert Kuhn.
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Kuhn, author of The Man Who Changed China: The Life and

president and to Iowa as vice president as one of the best images as for China.

THE FOURTH PLENARY SESSION OF THE 18TH
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China opens on
Monday and will last for four days. The designated theme —
governing through the rule of law — indicates how important
this meeting will be for the future of both the Party and the
country.
That this is the first time in 17 years the Party has designated
such a theme for a plenary session speaks volumes about the
importance the new leadership attaches to it. It is high on the
agenda.
Yet, the more the concept of rule of law has been discussed,
the more obvious it becomes that there is, today, much to be
desired.
More than 50 minister­level or higher officials have either
been indicted or placed under investigation for abuse of power
in the past year or so, underlining the fact that the rule of law is
sorely needed. It is perhaps the only way to eliminate, once
and for all, the most serious threat to good governance and to
secure the blessings of prosperity and justice to the people.
The fact that power today can effectively nullify the law, and
that those in power can circumvent it, not only deprives the
Party of its capacity to govern the country in a consistently fair
and just manner but also disrupts the reasonable running of
the marketplace. Abuse of power makes it impossible for fairness
to prevail in the socialist market economy.
Despite the great achievements China has made over more
than three decades, it will be very difficult for its economy to
grow in a sound manner — and neither will society progress in
a healthy way — unless fair competition and mutual trust can
be secured and ordinary people’s rights and interests can be
guaranteed through the rule of law.
If the country is to achieve further reforms in various fields
and establish and maintain a fair and just society, the powerworshipping
mentality among government and Party officials
must be eliminated. This is a core goal of the leadership.
Unless the overwhelming majority of Party and government
officials not only respect the law, but follow it when making
decisions, governing the country by the rule of law will
amount to little but lip service.
It will be no easy job, and it will take time for the power­oriented
way of doing things to be transformed. But the new Party
leadership has shown it has the courage to face the
challenge. We therefore have reason to expect much from the
current plenary session as they work to put the country on the
right track.

Party of China Central Committee, whose theme is
Tmunist
promoting the rule of law, embodies the CPC’s deepening perception
on governance and the law.
www.people.com.cn October 15.
t is the first time that the CPC, as the ruling Party, will make a
Icomprehensive plan on the rule of law in the form of a Party document.
The session, which marks the ruling Party’s significant
strategic layout on how to govern the nation in accordance with
laws and the Constitution, illustrates its new exploration of socialism
with Chinese characteristics. The CPC Central Committee will
focus on discussions on how to promote rule of law in at a plenary
session. ...
It has only six years to 2020, the deadline set for the realization
of a well­off society for China, and 35 years to 2049, the promised
year for China to be a prosperous, democratic, civilized and harmonious
socialist modern nation. All these mean China has
entered a crucial stage of deepened reforms. Only by sticking to
“governance of the nation according to laws” will China realize its
historic mission.

he National People’s Congress, China’s top legislature, should
Tplay a bigger role in the country’s efforts to promote the rule of
law. For example, the NPC can push for deepened reforms within
the framework of the Constitution and laws through legislation to
realize a benign interaction between reforms and the rule of law.
The deeper the water China’s reforms will enter, the more legal
guidance and guarantees these reforms will need. The NPC enjoys
a broad space for maneuvering in this regard.

Decoding Xi’s future vision
President Xi’s new book reveals his thinking about the country’s
governance and maps out a path for achieving the Chinese Dream
The Governance of China, President
Xi Jinping’s new book, is
unprecedented. Can analyzing
the book elucidate Xi’s thinking
and illuminate China’s future?
Consider seven frameworks or
perspectives: publishing purposes,
overarching themes, content analysis, chain of
developmental causation, domestic goals, domestic
means and global principles.
Publishing Purposes: substance,
symbol, signal. Substance means Xi’s political philosophy
and wide­ranging policies — organizing 79
speeches and commentaries in 18 chapters — to
discern how Xi intends to realize the Chinese
Dream, “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation”. Symbol means recognizing Xi’s emergence
as China’s leader, with greater authority, confidence
and support than observers had expected
when he first took office two years ago. Signal
means communicating Xi’s way of thinking to
global audiences in nine languages, an original
and explicit outreach to engage the world on multiple
levels.
Overarching Themes: pride, stability, responsibility,
vision. Pride expresses the yearning of the
Chinese people for the “great rejuvenation”. Stability
means maintaining the current political system
(Socialism with Chinese characteristics and the
Party’s leadership). Responsibility means “realizing
a moderately prosperous society by the centenary
of the Party in 2021”. Vision means “turning
China into a prosperous, democratic, culturally
advanced and harmonious modern socialist country
by the centenary of the People’s Republic of
China in 2049”.
Content Analysis. How does Xi impute importance
to topics? By examining what’s in Xi’s book,
can we explore what’s on Xi’s mind? Of the book’s
18 chapters, 11 relate to domestic affairs, seven to
foreign affairs; six have political relevance; six concern
standards of living; and four standards of
L I M I N
behavior. Categorizing the content, about a third is
politics and people; another third on international
relations; about 15 percent each on reform and
development, and society and culture; and about 8
percent on national security and defense. Pervasive
throughout is reform.
Chain of Developmental Causation. The
Chinese Dream is founded on political stability,
which enables far­reaching reform, which in turn
promotes economic development, and which,
when combined with rule of law and Chinese values,
strengthens China’s society, culture, ecology
and even defense. Where is this “chain of causation”
in Xi’s book?
The first and last chapters affirm political stability:
“Socialism with Chinese Characteristics” and
“The CPC Leadership”, both of which assert the
Party’s political primacy and thus assure social stability.
“The Chinese Dream” is the second chapter,
proclaiming the grand mission of national resurgence
and personal well­being. Then, chapters on
deepening reform and economic development,
which lead to chapters on rule of law, advanced culture,
social undertakings and ecological progress.
Domestic Goals: values, morality, prosperity,
fairness, happiness. Values: Xi’s vision is to inculcate
China’s traditional values — “the thoughts of
the ancient sages”, exemplified by Confucianism —
into socialist core values. (“We must take traditional
Chinese culture as the base.”) Morality: Derived
from values, morality is described as “conscious
law”, and “civic morality” is characterized as needing
improvement, while “paragons of morality are
important banners for building public ethics”. (“A
gentleman takes morality as his bedrock” — a traditional
virtue that Xi quotes.) Prosperity: “Common
prosperity is the fundamental principle of
Chinese socialism … We will accelerate China’s
overall prosperity”. Fairness: Because the Chinese
people have always had a perception that “inequality
rather than want is the cause of trouble”, Xi
says, China “should do a better job of promoting
Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng
arrived in the lobby of the European
Commission’s headquarters at 9
o’clock on Saturday morning. He was
led to the office of outgoing Trade Commissioner
Karel De Gucht, who has been a thorn in the side
of Chinese businesses because of his protectionist
attitude ever since he took over the job in 2010.
De Gucht, 60, will be replaced in a few days by
Swedish politician Cecilia Malmstrom, 46, when
a newly constituted commission gets underway.
In the afternoon, the Chinese side announced a
long­awaited agreement in principle: Brussels
will not launch an investigation into subsidies of
China’s telecommunication imports into the
European market. The EU side still needs to go
through internal procedures for formal approval.
The threat was mainly targeted at Chinese telecommunications
equipment makers Huawei
Technologies Co and ZTE Corp.
While the big picture of relations has been a
positive one, the Europeans have annoyed Beijing
from time to time — for example, by allowing the
Dalai Lama to visit, by attacking China on human
rights and by imposing high trade barriers.
Despite such irritants, Beijing has sent constructive
signals. In the first half of this year, President
Xi Jinping paid the first­ever visit of a
Chinese president to the European Union’s headquarters.
And last week, at the summit of Asian
and European leaders in Milan, Italy, Premier Li
Keqiang hosted a special dinner for Barroso and
European Council President Herman Van Rompuy,
thanking them for their contributions to positive
relations. At the dinner, the leaders were
thought to have touched on the telecommunication
trade dispute, which involves about 1 billion
euros ($1.26 billion) annually.
The path to Saturday’s solution was similar to a
pattern set earlier, in mid­2013, after both sides
worked through an anti­dumping and anti­subsidy
investigation involving China’s multi­billiondollar
solar panel exports to the EU. Brussels
began that investigation in 2012.
Beijing was unhappy that there had been no
high­level invitation to visit Brussels a year after
the launch of the investigation.
In May last year, Li made his first trip to Germany
after taking office and won the support of
the German government, which vetoed Brussels’
decision, following dozens of EU member states.
Li made a last­minute call on Barroso the following
month, as Brussels was about to vote on
whether to end the solar panel dispute through
amicable consultation.
Li’s decisive role was crucial in preventing the
escalation of a trade war. If Beijing had opted to
deal with such disputes in an eye­for­eye, toothfor­tooth
manner, both sides would have been
losers, with the EU taking the brunt. It has
already suffered two economic recessions, and
its jobless rate has been in double digits for a
few years now.
Of course, with the trade volume between China
and Europe expanding, and with investment
pouring into Europe, China’s government, its
businesses and its media must work to make the
most of the rising economic tide.
fairness and justice”. Happiness: The Chinese
Dream, Xi says, is to “bring happiness to the Chinese
people”, to “ensure the people greater happiness”
— but, he cautions, “happiness does not fall
from the sky, nor do dreams come true automatically.”
(In Xi’s book, “values” occurs about 120
times, “morality” 24, “prosperity” 67, “fairness” 44
and “happiness’’ 16.)
Domestic Means: close to the people, realism,
stability, reform, rule of law, combating corruption.
“Close to the people” is an all­encompassing
way of thinking that shapes all decisions. Realism:
“I have repeatedly said that the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation can in no way be realized
easily,” Xi says. “While fully affirming our achievements,
we should also be aware of our shortcomings.”
Stability: The precondition for all else,
stability is a recurrent and foundational theme
(“stability” occurs 125 times). Reform: Those who
wonder whether Xi is a “real reformer” should
read “Explanatory Notes … Concerning Comprehensively
Continuing Reform” (page 76). Examples:
the market plays a “decisive role”; farmers
given transactional property rights; the judicial
system separate from the administrative system.
Rule of Law: “A fundamental principle” and “the
basic way to run the country” — the Fourth Plenary
of the 18th CPC Central Committee, focusing on
rule of law, is Xi’s call to action. Combating corruption
is a hallmark of Xi’s administration, enhancing
each of the five other domestic means. It is no
accident that the chapter on combating corruption
is positioned, significantly, between “Close Ties
with the People” and “The CPC Leadership”.
I bear witness to Xi’s consistency. In 2006, Adam
Zhu (my long­term partner) and I met privately
with then­Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi. He stressed
that while China should be properly proud of its
successes, “achievements should not engender
complacency”. Xi said: “We need to assess ourselves
objectively.”
Global Principles. Consider five. Independence
(China remains unaligned). Multi­polar
world (no country dominates). One country, two
systems (Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan). Peaceful
development (“We have made a solemn pledge to
the whole world that we will never seek hegemony”).
Multilateral affairs (cooperation with the
global community). These five global principles
drive China’s “new model of major country relations”
(primarily with the US), “neighborhood
diplomacy” (Japan, Vietnam, Koreas, etc.), and
“cooperation with developing countries” (such as
in Africa). The Silk Road economic belt (land route
and maritime) is President Xi’s new initiative for
multinational development.
Here’s my blurb for Xi’s book: “This book is a
milestone, both in substance and symbol, offering
openly the political philosophy of President Xi Jinping
and recognizing his emergence as China’s
senior leader. While misunderstandings about
China and its leadership abound, there is now no
need to speculate about President Xi. Here is how
he thinks, candidly and comprehensively.” It is the
pride of a patriot.

Courtesy, not confrontation, best for Europe
So far, there is no unified Chinese business
council in Brussels to represent and lobby for
Chinese investors in Europe. By contrast, a major
US business organization reportedly has 300 staff
members focusing on Brussels’ policymaking.
A lack of communication and influence can
easily lead to misunderstandings. Bureaucrats in
Brussels usually follow Washington’s lead when
making policies that affect China.
Trade commission leaders need to make more
field trips to member states to learn how Chinese
businesses matter.
Take China’s solar panel exports for example.
The industry, which involves about 400,000
workers in China, has offered competitive products
to thousands of European upstream companies
and helped Europe achieve its status as a
green energy leader.
In telecom, Huawei and ZTE are deeply integrated
with European partners. And, incidentally,
Huawei is a steady job creator in Europe, where
young people, in particular, have faced huge
employment challenges.
If De Gucht had kept the big picture in mind,
he would not have made confrontational moves
against China and its businesses.
Overall, the EU recognizes China as strong strategic
partner. This is the starting point for dispute
control. Amicability helps both sides win. With
confrontation, everyone loses.

The insider with an outside view
strategist, Banker and author has intimate knowledge of China — and its leaders
By Andrew Moody
andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn
Robert Lawrence Kuhn says
the West often doesn’t
understand the Chinese
leadership’s key priorities
for China. The 67-year-old American
is seen by many as one of the few
figures outside the world’s secondlargest
economy who actually does.
He is regarded as a knowledgeable
insider, having been an adviser to
a number of leading Chinese bodies
since the late-1980s and knowing
many of the country’s top political
figures personally.
“There is rarely alignment between
what topics China’s leaders think are
important about China and what
the world thinks,” says Kuhn, also
an international corporate strategist
and investment banker. “Understanding
China requires knowing the
difference.”
He was speaking recently in the
five-star Grand Hyatt hotel in central
Beijing, which is his home for 90 days
a year. The rest of the time he divides
between his three homes in the United
States and traveling elsewhere.
“They treat me very well here.
Even when I travel around China, I
keep a room here,” he says.
The hotel is well placed near to
China’s seat of government around
Tian’anmen Square where he has an
extensive network of contacts.
His latest book, How China’s Leaders
Think: The Inside Story of China’s
Past, Current and Future Leaders,
which is now out in paperback and
more than 500 pages, goes into
extensive detail about those who
have the responsibility for shaping
modern China.
Kuhn, who cuts a dapper figure,
says many in the West often have an
outdated view about modern Chinese
leaders.
“The reality is that China’s leaders
are meritocratic,” he says.
“Many have strong academic backgrounds
from top universities and
all have significant experience, often
having run two or more provinces or
major municipalities as Party secretary,
governor or mayor.”
Kuhn, who is also a new China
Daily columnist, is much in demand
from major news organizations
around the world, including TV
appearances on BBC, CNBC, Euronews
and Bloomberg TV, and says he
has had complete freedom to express
his opinions.
“I have written three books about
China, dozens of articles and columns;
I’ve produced two major TV
documentaries about China and
given scores of media interviews —
and never has anyone in China even
requested to censor anything I’ve
published or broadcast outside of
China,” he says.
Some in the West, however, have
accused him of being too much of an
insider and not giving the full picture
about China because he was too close
to the leadership.
Robert Lawrence Kuhn says China’s growth is good for the world, but it cannot save the world.
“I deem it vital, considering China’s
importance in the world, that
China’s leaders become more known
to the world, and known not just via
sound-bites and photo ops, but by
seeing them up-close as real people
— hearing their own words, listening
to their stories, getting their ways
of thinking. I’m pleased to facilitate
some of this,” he says.
“I also offer my own analysis. As
for my accuracy and understanding,
readers or viewers can judge for
themselves.”
Kuhn, who was born in New York,
began his career as a scientist. After
studying biology at John Hopkins
University, he did a doctorate in
anatomy and brain research at the
University of California at Los Angeles
in the 1960s. Brain science and
consciousness remain major interests
of his.
His first involvement in China was
through the scientific community in
the late-1980s when he worked with
scientists reforming China’s research
and technology base. He received an
invitation from Song Jian, then a
State councilor and chairman of the
State Science and Technology Commission.
At the time he was developing a
parallel business career and became
president of The Geneva Companies,
a leading US mergers and acquisitions
company, which he eventually
sold to Citigroup in 2000.
At the same time he was cementing
links with leading business and
political figures in China.
His organization, The Kuhn Foundation,
with CCTV (China Central
Television), produced the documentary
In Search of China for PBS in the
US, which was broadcast in 2000.
He is now working on a new fivepart
series China’s Challenges, which
will be broadcast in China in the
autumn and syndicated to PBS stations
in the US next year.
Perhaps Kuhn’s most significant
project was writing a biography of
former president Jiang Zemin, which
was the best-selling book in China
in 2005.
How China’s Leaders Think was
based on interviews with more than
100 leading Chinese political figures,
some of whom he has known for
more than a decade.
“I know many personally and have
worked with several for a number of
years. When you hear them speak
over a period of time, it gives you
a sense of their personalities and
character as well as their intellectual
capabilities, leadership style and
political progress,” he says.
Kuhn sometimes likes to invoke
humor to explain why there is sometimes
friction between Chinese and
American leaders.
“Some people think it is because
feng yongbin / China Daily
of ideological, historical or cultural
reasons that we have communication
problems. As I once pointed out,
perhaps it’s because China’s leaders,
the members of the Politburo Standing
Committee, were trained as engineers,
and most American politicians
were trained as lawyers. Maybe the
problem is that lawyers and engineers
can’t talk to one another!”
Kuhn says the main focus in the
West is often the Chinese economy
and whether it will continue to
motor ahead.
“China should have 10 to 20 more
years of what we should still call relatively
high growth, driven by continuing
the country’s unprecedented
urbanization and modernization.
“Growth rates will naturally ease
from reform’s historic averages —
probably to 6 to 8 percent per annum
— which is less than we are used to,
but which may be optimal because
China can more effectively deal with
its most severe problems, particularly
economic and social imbalances
and sustainable development.
“However, China’s economy is fragile,
vulnerable to exogenous shock.
China’s growth is good for the world,
but it cannot ‘save the world’,” he
says.
Kuhn says there is often a danger
of China being misrepresented
because it is seen through a narrow
perspective.

Lu Feiran
China expert and American public intellectual,
Robert Lawrence Kuhn is best known in
China for two books about Chinese leaders
and their views, including a biography of
former President Jiang Zemin in 2005 and one about
other leaders and their thinking in 2009.
Kuhn, also an investment banker, business consultant,
brain scientist and philosopher, has been
granted unprecedented access to Chinese leaders,
though he does not speak Chinese.
His biography “The Man Who Changed China:
The Life and Legacy of Jiang Zemin” published in
both Chinese and English, was a best-seller in China
where readers are not accustomed to humanized
biographies of leaders.
It was probably the first biography written by a
foreigner about a living Chinese leader that was
published in China.
Kuhn has also produced documentaries on China,
written extensively for Chinese media and is often
quoted by western media. He is a contributor and
consultant to CCTV, some Chinese newspapers and
the Xinhua News Agency.
Kuhn sees his mission as telling the world about
the real China.
He was in Shanghai late last month for an International
Channel Shanghai (ICS) program he
co-produced and wrote about China’s challenges, in
conjunction with the 18th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China. He held a press conference
and also spoke with Shanghai Daily.
Chinese media sometimes accuse some Westerners
and Western media of China bashing, saying they
misunderstand or are even malevolent.
But 68-year-old Kuhn, a New Yorker, is believed
to have a more neutral view for China. He received
a bachelor’s degree in human biology from Johns
Hopkins University, a master’s of science in management
from the MIT Sloan School of Management,
and a PhD in anatomy and brain research from
UCLA.
His books were published by the Shanghai Translation
Publishing House and Shanghai Century
Publishing Group.
Kuhn said he “never tried to please the Chinese
government, though Western media thought I did.”
“I like feedback, including negative feedback,
because I know that people are engaged,” he told
Shanghai Daily.
“I don’t try to make anybody happy, but I just want
to tell the truth. I can be wrong, and maybe my truth
is not balanced.”
Kuhn’s experience with China started in 1989,
when he was invited by former State Councilor Song
Jian, director of the State Science and Technology
Commission.
The two became friends and Kuhn began traveling
between the US and China, getting to know government
officials and ordinary people.
Kuhn said he felt frustrated because his experience
in China differed from the description in much of
the Western media. “Then they only focused on the
negative side and ignored the rest,” he said.
That disparity inspired him to write Jiang’s biography,
he said. Jiang himself said that Kuhn didn’t
“beautify” him and got his wedding date wrong.
Kuhn spent four years writing “The Man Who
Changed China.” Though he had only met Jiang three
times and did not interview him for the book, he
talked to many people close to Jiang, including relatives,
friends and colleagues, gathering stories and
perceptions. He became close to many of them.
“I thought I had been rather familiar with China
before I started working on the book,” said Kuhn.
“But after I started collecting the information, I
found that my knowledge was very limited.”
Humanized leader
Kuhn said he was determined to depict a real, animated
Jiang, different from the seemingly impassive
figure appearing on state occasions, on Chinese TV
and in newspapers.
“For a very long time, Chinese leaders were either
described as God or the Devil, but never in-between,”
he said. “So I expected to display a Chinese leader
who is a human being.”
Soon after publication, it became a best-seller in
China. After Kuhn held a book-signing in Guangzhou,
Guangdong Province, more than 300 books
were sold in an hour. In Shanghai, more than a
million copies were sold in 2005, the highest in the
social science category.
Chinese readers called the book refreshing because
it told daily life stories and described Jiang’s
youth.
One Internet user called “Burn the scarecrow” said
before reading the biography, he thought Jiang was
“a quiet man standing high above the masses.”
“But after reading the book, my first feeling was
that he was once young like us and he is also an
ordinary man.”
The English version, however, received some criticism,
primarily that Kuhn was “fawning” over Jiang
and the government. Kuhn denied that.
“In fact, the book had a disclaimer, saying all

库恩坦言 , 在写这本书的过程中 , 自己与江泽民仅仅在公开场合见过 3 次面。
“1993 年 , 江泽民对古巴进行国事访问 ,
住在古巴国宾馆 , 当时 , 我也在那里。我站在走廊上 , 而他正好也走了出来。那是我们的第一次见面。 ”2000 年 9 月 , 江泽民赴纽约参加联合国千禧年首脑峰会 , 他在一次招待会上第二次见到江泽民。 3 年后 , 库恩又在北京听了江泽民关于几个重要问题的讲话。尽管没采访到江泽民本人 ,
库恩却并不觉得有什么遗憾。在他看来 ,
这本书只是传记而非自传 , 没必要非采访到本人。为了完成这本书 , 库恩总是随身带着手提电脑 , 一有空就开始写作 , 从周一到周五 , 他常常工作至凌晨。每当他在吃完饭后一头钻进书房 , 妻子总会调侃他 “ 又去见江泽民了 ”。整整 4 年 ,3 次重写 ,5
次编辑 , 库恩光资料就搜集了 3000 万字 ,

2006 年 3 月 , 库恩在浙江与习近平会谈。万册 , 仅 10 多天就销售一空。为新书做巡回推广时 , 由于签名数量太多 , 库恩的手肘甚至有些劳损 ,“ 影响了打网球 ”。走访中国 40 多个城市《他改变了中国—— 江泽民传》的成功 , 让库恩有了进一步探寻中国整体形象的想法。他于是带着助手 , 开始走访中国
40 多个城市 , 进行深入的、大规模的调查研究。就是在这次调研过程中 ,2005 年 2 月
26 日 , 库恩在浙江西子宾馆见到了时任浙江省委书记习近平。习近平向库恩介绍了浙江的经济、历史和文化等方面的情况 ,
并感谢库恩多年来从自己独到的角度研究中国、向世界介绍中国 , 在中美两国之间搭起了文化的桥梁。次年 3 月 , 库恩再次来到浙江 , 这一次 , 他的目的是了解 “ 浙江模式 ”。虽然是不期而至 , 但习近平仍挤出时间与他见面。习近平说 , 自己之所以要这么做 , 是要 “ 表示我们对库恩先生关注中国、客观介绍中国的感激之意 ”。库恩回忆说 , 习近平在那次谈话中强
调了中国自改革开放以来发生的翻天覆地的变化。 “‘ 有句老话 , 士别三日当刮目相看。你一个月不来 , 半年不来 , 中国就会有很大的变化。 ’ 他又补充说 ,‘ 但如果结合中国悠久的历史来分析 , 又不会惊讶于它变化之快 , 因为我们经历了几千年才走到这一步。无论我们怎么看待这一速度 ,
中国的发展变化 , 至少在一定程度上 , 是由爱国热情和民族自豪感推动的。 ’”
让库恩印象最深的是 , 在谈及如何以最好的方式向世界介绍中国时 , 习近平提出 , 中国的情况无法用简单的一句话来描述 , 或用单一的方法来概括 , 并借用中国古代寓言 “ 盲人摸象 ” 来说明这个问题。 “ 他把中国富裕的东部沿海比作大象的腿 , 而将中国广袤的西部比作大象宽阔的后背 ,
认为 ‘ 象是一个完整的概念 , 必须全面地了解 , 要避免犯盲人摸象的错误 ’。 ” 对库恩来说 , 这样的比喻是新颖而有用的 , 这个说法 , 他到现在还记得。接连的调研 , 让库恩对中国有了更深入的认识。
2007 年 12 月 9 日 , 时任中宣部部长刘云山在与库恩的一次会谈中提议 , 如果由他来写一部关于中国改革 30 年的书 ,
一定很有意义。库恩知道 , 这次又说到他心坎上了。库恩列出了一份庞大的采访名单 , 每次采访前 , 他会向被采访对象提供三四十个问题的采访提纲 , 后者通常会选择其中的二三十个作答。采访结束后 , 库恩再根据采访录音进行整理 , 并对其中提及的年份、数字和事实进行核实。在与 100 余位省部级官员、企业领袖和专家学者沟通交流 , 并采访了诸多改革开放的亲历者后 , 库恩用 5 个月时间完成了 80 万字的初稿。 “ 我的家人说 , 整整一年 ,
他们只能看到我的后脑勺。 ”
2008 年 12 月 ,《中国 30 年 : 人类社会的一次伟大变迁》中文版在中国发行。第二年 , 为纪念新中国成立 60 周年 , 该书英文版在全球出版发行。截至目前 , 这本书是唯一由外国人详细描述中国改革开放 30 年进程的书籍。

action.

The exterior lines of Israel's neighbors prevented effective, concerted
action. Israel's interior lines permitted efficient deployment and
redeployment of force. It was not obvious at the time, but in
retrospect we can see that once Israel existed, was united and had
even limited military force, its survival was guaranteed. That is, so
long as no great power was opposed to its existence.

From its founding until the Camp David Accords re-established the
Sinai as a buffer with Egypt, Israel's strategic problem was this: So
long as Egypt was in the Sinai, Israel's national security requirements
outstripped its military capabilities. It could not simultaneously field
an army, maintain its civilian economy and produce all the weapons
and supplies needed for war. Israel had to align itself with great
powers who saw an opportunity to pursue other interests by arming
Israel.

Israel's first patron was the Soviet Union — through Czechoslovakia —
which supplied weapons before and after 1948 in the hopes of using
Israel to gain a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel, aware of
the risks of losing autonomy, also moved into a relationship with a
declining great power that was fighting to retain its empire: France.
Struggling to hold onto Algeria and in constant tension with Arabs,
France saw Israel as a natural ally. And apart from the operation
against Suez in 1956, Israel saw in France a patron that was not in a
position to reduce Israeli autonomy. However, with the end of the
Algerian war and the realignment of France in the Arab world, Israel
became a liability to France and, after 1967, Israel lost French
patronage.

Israel did not become a serious ally of the Americans until after 1967.
Such an alliance was in the American interest. The United States had,
as a Strategic imperative, the goal of keeping the Soviet navy out of
the Mediterranean or, at least, blocking its unfettered access. That

Edward Osborne Wilson is a world leading biologist
and internationally recognized as one of the planet’s
most articulate authorities on the interrelatedness
of knowledge disciplines and of life systems.

He is acknowledged for two interdisciplinary
scientific disciplines (island biogeography and
sociobiology), three unifying concepts for science and
the humanities jointly (biophilia, biodiversity studies,
and consilience), and one technological advance in the
study of global biodiversity (the Encyclopedia of Life).

Anative of Alabama, Wilson grew up in Mobile
and received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in biology
from The University of Alabama (1949, 1950) and his
doctoral degree in biology from Harvard University (1955).

Wilson has received more than 100 awards for
his research on ants and biodiversity and for his writings
addressed to both scientific and non-scientific audiences.
He has received two Pulitzer Prizes in general non-fiction

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

example, they ask whether an employer
that occasionally uses text messaging or
Twitter to communicate with employees
would have to use those technologies
and, if so, how they would be able to
comply with the rule, in view of the
length restrictions of these media. The
U.S. Chamber of Commerce raises the
same issue regarding faxing, voice mail,
and instant messaging. The National
Roofing Contractors Association notes
that some employers use email to
communicate with certain employees,
while other employees have no access to
email during their work day. As to email
communication itself, an individual
observes that many employees change
jobs every 3 to 4 years, and an email
reaches only those in the workforce at

a specific time. The same comment
notes that the proposed rule does not
state when or how often email notice
should be provided. Three Georgetown
law students recommend that the rule
mandate email as well as intranet notice
to employees when it goes into effect
and written notice to new employees
within a week of their starting
employment.

The Board responds that, as discussed
above regarding the location of posting,
“customarily” is used in its normal
meaning. This provision of the rule
would not apply to an employer that
only occasionally uses electronic means
to communicate with employees.
However, in view of the numerous
comments expressing concern over the
proposed rule’s email posting
requirements, the Board has decided not
to require employers to provide the
notice to employees by means of email
and the other forms of electronic
communication listed in the previous
paragraph. In the Board’s judgment, the
potential for confusion and the prospect
of requiring repeated notifications in
order to reach new employees outweigh
the benefits that could be derived at the
margin from such notifications. All
employers subject to the rule will be
required to post the notice physically in
their facilities; and employers who
customarily post notices to employees
regarding personnel rules or policies on
an internet or intranet site will be
required to post the Board’s notice on
those sites as well. Moreover, those
notices (unlike the Board’s election and
remedial notices) must remain posted;
thus, it is reasonable to expect that even
though some employees may not see the
notices immediately, more and more
will see them and learn about their
NLRA rights as time goes by.
Accordingly, the only electronic

Mount Sterling, Kentucky Chamber of Commerce;
U.S. Xpress, Inc.

postings required under the final rule
will be those on internet or intranet
sites.

Many comments address the
characteristics of electronic posting, as
prescribed in § 104.202(f). In the NPRM,
the Board proposed not to prescribe the
size, clarity, location, or brightness of an
electronic notice or link to the notice,
but rather require that it be at least as
prominent as other electronic notices to
employees, as the Department of Labor’s
rule requires. No comments suggest
more specific requirements; the
Michigan Health & Hospital Association
argues that such requirements would
result in inadvertent noncompliance.
The Board has decided to adopt the
Department of Labor’s approach, as
proposed in the NPRM.

Baker & McKenzie urges that the title
of the link in the proposed rule be
changed to ‘Employee Rights under the
National Labor Relations Act” rather
than “Important Notice about
Employees Rights to Organize and
Bargain Collectively with Their
Employers.’ The Board agrees and has
revised the rule accordingly.

A comment from Vigilant states that
a link to the Board’s Web site, which is
one means of electronic posting, should
not be required to include the
introductory language of the notice. The
Board agrees, noting that the
Department of Labor takes this
approach, and will not require that
electronic links to the Board’s Web site
include the introductory language.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board
has decided to retain the posting
requirements as proposed in the NPRM,
modified as indicated above.

e. Compliance With the Department of
Labor’s Rule

Several comments opposing the
proposed rule urge that, if the rule
becomes final, the Board should retain
the “safe harbor’ provided for Federal
contractors that comply with the
Department of Labor’s notice posting
rule.134 However, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce states that some employers
post the Department of Labor’s notice at
facilities where it is not required or
where Federal contract work is
performed only sporadically. It
questions whether such employers must
replace the Department of Labor’s notice
with the Board’s when no contract work
is being performed, or whether they can
comply with the Board’s rule by leaving
the Department of Labor’s notice in
place. The Chamber proposes that

134 See, e.g., comments of IFDA; Estes; The Sack
Company; National Roofing Contractors
Association.

employers be allowed to choose to
maintain the Department of Labor’s
notice, although another comment
asserts that employees might think that
the notice is no longer applicable
because of the lack of a current contract.
Another comment raises the possibility
that either the Board or the Department
of Labor could decide to change its
notice and emphasized that they need to
be identical in order to provide the safe
harbor. The Board responds that a
Federal contractor that complies with
the Department of Labor’s notice-
posting rule will be deemed in
compliance with the Board’s
requirement.135

3. Exceptions

The rule applies only to employers
that are subject to the NLRA. Under
NLRA Section 2(2), “employer”
excludes the United States government,
any wholly owned government
corporation, any Federal Reserve Bank,
any State or political subdivision, and
any person subject to the Railway Labor
Act, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seg. 29 U.S.C.
152(2). Thus, under the proposed rule,
those excluded entities are not required
to post the notice of employee rights.
The proposed rule also does not apply
to entities that employ only individuals
who are not considered “employees”’
under the NLRA. See Subpart A, below;
29 U.S.C. 152(3). Finally, the proposed
rule does not apply to entities over
which the Board has been found not to
have jurisdiction, or over which the
Board has chosen through regulation or
adjudication not to assert
jurisdiction.13® The Board proposed that
all employers covered under the NLRA
would be subject to the notice posting
tule. 75 FR 80413.

The Coalition for a Democratic
Workplace argues that the final rule
cannot be applied to religiously-
affiliated employers. The Coalition
argues that assertion of jurisdiction
would “substantially burden [such
employers’] exercise of religion in
violation of both the First Amendment
and the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act.” Similarly, Seyfarth Shaw contends
that religiously-affiliated healthcare

135 A few comments ask whether the Board’s rule
would preempt the Department of Labor’s rule.
Because the answer to that question would not
affect the validity of the Board’s rule, the Board
finds it unnecessary to take a position on that issue
in this proceeding.

136 The proposed rule excludes small businesses
whose impact on interstate commerce is de minimis
or so slight that they do not meet the Board’s
discretionary jurisdiction requirements. See
generally An Outline of Law and Procedure in
Representation Cases, Chapter 1, found on the
Board’s Web site, http://www.nirb.gov, and cases
cited therein.

. Then we turn to distributed, neural-net-like knowledge representation, reviewing a host of
general issues related to knowledge representation in attractor neural networks, turning finally
to “glocal” knowledge representation mechanisms, in which ANNs combine localist and globalist
representation, and explaining the relationship of the latter to CogPrime. The glocal aspect of
CogPrime knowledge representation will become prominent in later chapters such as:

e in Chapter 23 of Part 2, where Economic Attention Networks (ECAN) are introduced and
seen to have dynamics quite similar to those of the attractor neural nets considered here,
but with a mathematics roughly modeling money flow in a specially constructed artificial
economy rather than electrochemical dynamics of neurons.

e in Chapter 42 of Part 2, where “map formation” algorithms for creating localist knowledge
from globalist knowledge are described

13.2 Localized Knowledge Representation using Weighted, Labeled
Hypergraphs

There are many different mechanisms for representing knowledge in AI systems in an explicit,
localized way, most of them descending from various variants of formal logic. Here we briefly
describe how it is done in CogPrime, which on the surface is not that different from a number of
prior approaches. (The particularities of CogPrime’s explicit knowledge representation, however,
are carefully tuned to match CogPrime’s cognitive processes, which are more distinctive in
nature than the corresponding representational mechanisms.)

13.2.1 Weighted, Labeled Hypergraphs

One useful way to think about CogPrime’s explicit, localized knowledge representation is in
terms of hypergraphs. A hypergraph is an abstract mathematical structure [Bol98], which con-
sists of objects called Nodes and objects called Links which connect the Nodes. In computer
science, a graph traditionally means a bunch of dots connected with lines (i.e. Nodes connected
by Links). A hypergraph, on the other hand, can have Links that connect more than two Nodes.

In these pages we will often consider “generalized hypergraphs” that extend ordinary hyper-
graphs by containing two additional features:

e Links that point to Links instead of Nodes
e Nodes that, when you zoom in on them, contain embedded hypergraphs.

Properly, such “hypergraphs” should always be referred to as generalized hypergraphs, but
this is cumbersome, so we will persist in calling them merely hypergraphs. In a hypergraph
of this sort, Links and Nodes are not as distinct as they are within an ordinary mathematical
graph (for instance, they can both have Links connecting them), and so it is useful to have a
generic term encompassing both Links and Nodes; for this purpose, we use the term Atom.

A weighted, labeled hypergraph is a hypergraph whose Links and Nodes come along with
labels, and with one or more numbers that are generically called weights. A label associated
with a Link or Node may sometimes be interpreted as telling you what type of entity it is, or

At TCMIH “Quality” will be the benchmark for our day to day performance. We believe quality
can be measured in many ways, from customer service surveys, on time performance measures, to
clinical indicator reviews and run report accuracy just to name a few. To ensure that TCMIH
remains focused on providing exceptional patient care from the request for service on through to
the reimbursement cycle, we have established quality assurance processes to create a culture in
which quality, excellence and accuracy is our focus. To achieve this, each day we will look at the
transports from the previous day and review how we performed. We will measure our on-time
performance, looking at each run report line-by-line to ensure we have met our protocol
requirements. We will make certain the crews have gathered the appropriate information allowing
us to properly bill on behalf of the patients while maintaining compliance with all Medicare,
Medicaid and other healthcare regulations.

Medical Necessity

Health Insurance providers and Medicare in particular, have strict guidelines on what they will
cover and what is deemed as “medically necessary”.

For the service to be determined medically necessary, the patient’s medical condition at the time
of transport must be such that any other means of transportation would have placed the patient at
risk for harm or deterioration.

In addition, Medicare and Medicaid have guidelines requiring all non-emergency ambulance
transports from a hospital, nursing home, physician’s office, out-patient facility or clinic to obtain
a Physician’s Certification statement (PCS). We will collect this statement at the time the request
for service is received as part of our normal practice.

Stand By / Special Events
TCMIH will provide both committed and non-committed ambulance standby / first aid station

support during sporting events, community gatherings, concerts, fairs, parades, and other public
and private events.

Code of Conduct

TCMIH will attribute its success and reputation to the ethical standards that our employees will
set forth in their day-to-day actions. Healthcare is a challenging field of endeavor, yet we know
we must meet each challenge with the highest level of integrity and resolve, not with shortcuts.

Operational Code of Professional Conduct
The primary goal of TCMIH 1s to ensure that all employees provide competent, safe and ethical
specialized transportation to the citizens of the Virgin Islands. TCMIH has adapted this Code of

Professional Conduct to define a set of professional standards that will augment the technical and
clinical aspects of our duties.

under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).
FACTS
Background of Request
6. Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire financier, philanthropist, and sex offender. In 2005, Epstein
became the subject of an undercover sex trafficking investigation by Palm Beach, Florida
police and the FBI. Dozens of underage women were trafficked by Epstein to perform sexual
acts on him as well as his friends.
7. Despite the gravity of his offenses, the Department of Justice allowed Epstein to plead guilty
to a single count of soliciting prostitution from a minor under Florida state law, and serve
only 13 months in prison. In addition, prosecutors agreed not to bring charges against
Epstein’s alleged co-conspirators.
8. Mr. Epstein enjoyed close ties to numerous prominent political figures, including former
President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family, leading many to
speculate whether he received preferential treatment from authorities. See Goodnough, Abby,
“Questions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised in Florida Sex Case,” The New York Times,
Sep. 3, 2006. (Exhibit A)
FOIA Request and Constructive Denial
9. On April 20, 2017 James Robertson, a Senior Editor for The National Enquirer and sisterpublication
Radar Online, submitted a FOIA request to the FBI for all documents relating to
the investigation and prosecution of Epstein (the “Request”). (Exhibit B)
10. Robertson requested expedited processing because Epstein’s crimes are the subject of
widespread and exceptional media interest, and raise questions about the government's
integrity, which affects public confidence; specifically, whether Mr. Epstein received
2
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 1 Filed 05/25/17 Page 3 of 3
preferential treatment from authorities due to his wealth, connections, and political leverage.
11. The FBI has provided no response to Mr. Robertson’s request, nor even assigned it a tracking
number. By failing to provide - or formally deny - documents within twenty working days,
the FBI has constructively denied the request under 5 U.S. Code § 552(a)(6)(A)(ii).
CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of the Freedom of Information Act for Wrongful Withholding of Agency Records
12. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1-11.
13. Defendant FBI has wrongfully withheld agency records requested by Plaintiff.
14. Plaintiff has exhausted all administrative remedies.
REQUESTED RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests this Court:
(A) Order defendant to provide access to the requested documents in their entirety;
(B) Expedite this proceeding as provided for in 28 U.S.C. § 1657;
(C) Award plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney fees in this action, as provided in 5
U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E); and
(D) Grant such other and further relief as may deem just and proper.

Questions of Preferential Treatment Are
Raised in Florida Sex Case
By ABBY GOODNOUGH SEPT. 3, 2006
PALM BEACH, Fla. — In the summer and autumn of last year, when most of the
mansions here stood empty behind their towering hedges, the police stealthily
watched one at the end of a waterside lane. They monitored the comings and goings
of its owner’s private jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his
trash.
The owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money
manager with several billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14­yearold
girl told the Palm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later
identified as Mr. Epstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her.
In sworn statements to the police, the 14­year­old and other teenage girls said a
friend had arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein’s home and give him massages,
usually in their underwear, in exchange for cash.
Most of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated
during the massages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or
penis. They identified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home.
Some recalled that his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars.
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 1-1 Filed 05/25/17 Page 2 of 5
Mr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged
with, soliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have
become increasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case
has raised questions about whether Mr. Epstein’s prominence won him preferential
treatment.
By the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein
with much more serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and
four counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor.
But instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County
state attorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a
grand jury, which indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida,
prosecutors usually refer only capital cases to grand juries.
Even before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had
accused prosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state
attorney, Barry E. Krischer, to remove himself from the case.
In an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose
post is elective, saying the public had been left “to wonder whether the system tilted
in favor of a wealthy, well­connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls
who are alleged victims of sex crimes.”
The case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial
home in Manhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former
President Bill Clinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic
candidate for governor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a
Democrat, have returned campaign contributions from him.
But Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including
Gerald B. Lefcourt and Alan M. Dershowitz, a friend of his, to look into the
backgrounds of his young accusers.
Mr. Lefcourt says that the police acted “outrageously” and that his client has
been wrongfully dragged through the mud.
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 1-1 Filed 05/25/17 Page 3 of 5
“He disputes that he ever had sex with any under­age person or anything like
that,” said Mr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart
and Abbie Hoffman.
Neither the police nor the state attorney’s office would discuss the case in detail.
But the police released a thick report on the 13­month investigation after the
indictment was unsealed in late July.
The police started investigating Mr. Epstein in March 2005, almost immediately
after they were contacted by the stepmother of the 14­year­old, who, according to the
report, was in a special school for students with disciplinary problems.
The girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had “offered her an
opportunity to make money” and had driven her to Mr. Epstein’s house one Sunday.
The friend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college
student, told the girl to say she was 18 if Mr. Epstein asked, the report said.
The girl told the police that Mr. Epstein’s assistant had led her upstairs to a
room with a massage table and that Mr. Epstein had come in and told her to remove
her clothes. She said Mr. Epstein had masturbated as she massaged him, had
pressed a vibrator against her underwear and had given her $300 afterward.
In October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr.
Epstein had routinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then
interviewed a total of 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar
stories about what they had observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein’s home.
According to the report, at least one said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse
with her.
Mr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with
Mr. Epstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown
up for grand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie­detector test
clearing him of any sexual involvement with under­age girls.
A spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police
went to Mr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 1-1 Filed 05/25/17 Page 4 of 5
Mr. Epstein. Instead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a
grand jury to examine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, to bring.
Around that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors
to share information about the accusers, including statements they had posted on
MySpace.com, the social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol.
According to the report, Mr. Krischer’s office then decided to delay the grand jury
session for several months.
The Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May 1 the
department asked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein.
Chief Reiter also wrote Mr. Krischer questioning “the unusual course that your
office’s handling of this matter has taken” and suggesting that Mr. Krischer
disqualify himself. Chief Reiter refused several requests to be interviewed, and his
spokeswoman would not say explicitly why he had urged the prosecutor to step
aside.
Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for Mr. Krischer, said the state attorney’s office
sometimes sent noncapital cases to grand juries when there were questions about
witness credibility. Mr. Krischer does not recommend a particular charge in such
cases, Mr. Edmondson said, but gives the grand jury a list of possible charges.
Bruce J. Winick, a law professor at the University of Miami, said that while
prosecutors in Florida rarely referred noncapital cases to grand juries, they
sometimes did so with sensitive cases to be extra­cautious.
Mr. Lefcourt said the police were wrong to have released the report so soon,
especially without correcting information that later proved wrong. He cited his
assertion that one accuser had lied about her age, adding that she had also been
arrested on drug charges and had been fired by her employer for stealing.
“What I’m trying to focus on,” Mr. Lefcourt said, “is, What’s motivating the
selective and misleading release of information to the public?”

(212) 743-6555
Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a reporter and editor for The National Enquirer. I request records under the provisions
of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.§ 552.
Request
The Enquirer seeks all documents relating to the FBI’s investigation and prosecution of
financier Jeffrey Edward Epstein, who pled guilty to one count of felony solicitation of
prostitution in August 2006.
Background
Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire financier, philanthropist, and sex offender. In 2005, Epstein
became the subject of an undercover sex trafficking investigation by Palm Beach, Florida
police and the FBI. Dozens of underage women claimed that they had been trafficked by
Epstein to perform sexual acts on him as well as his friends.
Many prominent political figures have been connected to Mr. Epstein’s child-trafficking
ring, including former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the British Royal
Family.

(Prince Andrew)
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/jeffrey-epstein-decade-scandal-princeandrew
Despite the gravity of his offenses, the Department of Justice agreed to allow Epstein to
plead guilty to a single count of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl under Florida
state law, and served only 13 months in prison. In addition, prosecutors agreed not to bring
charges against Epstein’s alleged co-conspirators.

Papers filed in a 2006 lawsuit alleged that Epstein surreptitiously recorded sexual activity
between prominent individuals and underage girls for purposes of blackmail, leaving many
to wonder whether potential blackmail material played a role in his light sentence:

1407641
Expedited Processing
This request has been the subject of the request is of widespread and exceptional media
interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's
integrity which affects public confidence. Specifically; the issue of whether Mr. Epstein’s
wealth and connections secured him favorable treatment by the DOJ.
Given that a civil defamation trial between one of Epstein’s victims and his alleged coconspirator,
Ghislaine Maxwell, has just begun, the topic is of renewed interest to the
public and therefore is worthy of expedited processing.
Certification
The above information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
Fee Waiver
The National Enquirer is a news organization. Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), the
Enquirer is entitled to a fee waiver because disclosure of the information sought is in the
public interest, is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations
or activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the
requester.
Electronic Records
Please furnish all responsive records in electronic format.
Further Correspondence
All correspondence regarding this request can be directed to me at jrobertson@amilink.com
Please be aware that under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A), a FOIA request is considered
constructively denied after twenty business days.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016453.txt,"The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their cause remain angry over what
they regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution

agreement have prospered.
BY MARTA OLIVER CRAVIOTTO & | EMILY MICHOT & | JULIEK.BROWN &

By December, Epstein had still not agreed to a date for his plea hearing, and was
technically in violation of the September agreement, which required him to
appear in court by November, Acosta noted in a letter to Kenneth Starr in
December 2007.

“The [U.S. attorneys] who have been negotiating with defense counsel have for
some time complained to me regarding the tactics used by the defense team,”
Acosta wrote. “It appears to them that as soon as resolution is reached on one
issue, defense counsel finds ways to challenge the resolution collaterally. ... Some
in our office are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to mount
collateral challenges to provisions to the agreement, even after Mr. Epstein has
entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the agreement difficult, if not
impossible, to unwind.”

And that’s exactly what happened.

"
IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026644.txt,"exchanged rising economic and political inequality for overall

prosperity. We have simply reached a point where this rising inequality is
no longer sustainable in democracies. This is not too different from what
Beijing has been struggling with — to slow down the headline economic
growth rate in exchange for more balance in various parts of the economy, in
order to allow its development to be more sustainable. The parallels in the
West seem quite clear to me. Fighting against this shift in the West, as most
mainstream media seem to be doing, is tantamount to those in China who are
fighting against the economic slowdown. (1) TPP is effectively dead, even
though there are some who are urging that TPP goes ahead without the

US. But I think multilateral trade pacts are in jeopardy. The Trump
Administration still wants to have trade arrangements, but they will be
bilateral and done with countries deemed friendly to the US. (2) The UK is
in a great position to deal with the Trump Administration because all the UK
needs is a bilateral trade arrangement that won’t take as long to work out,
compared to a multilateral trade arrangement. The UK just went from the
‘back of the queue’ (which was an insulting declaration by President Obama,
conspicuously using the word ‘queue’ to make sure the Brits understood
him) to the ‘front of the line.’ (3) China was never a part of the TPP
discussions. In fact, TPP was designed from day one to marginalise China,
to replace the current trade arrangement based on WTO rules to something
that puts China at a disadvantage. This is why Beijing is not unhappy with
the Trump Administration’s desire to terminate the TPP discussions. (4)
‘America First’ does not only mean ‘world second,’ that the US will take
actions to benefit the US even if these policies come at the expense of the
rest of the world. It also means that policies will be aimed at addressing the
inequality and inequity in the US, even if it means that the overall effects on
the US may be negative. (5) In sum, I don’t think trade globalisation will
reverse. But it will slow down dramatically and be substituted with a
different web of bilateral arrangements. I think this is a positive
development, as the previous model of global growth was unsustainable,
even if it generated the biggest aggregate prosperity for the world. (6) The
next US Treasury Secretary will likely be instructed by President Trump to
label China as a currency manipulator. While this would be a verdict
without basis, in my view, such a finding could be used as an excuse to
escalate the talks of protectionism.

Some musings... (1) President Obama just awarded his last round of
Presidential Medals of Freedom (America’s highest civilian honour) to
Michael Jordan, Ellen DeGeneres, Robert de Niro, and others. Many of
these award recipients were vocal critics of Mr Trump. My views on
politics really don’t matter... But for what it is worth, the reason why I have
been more vocal than I should have been about Brexit and the US Elections
is related to my own personal experience. I have witnessed how a previous
harmonious society could very quickly degenerate into a permanent state of

Think Tanks

Think tanks play an unparalleled role in shaping American public opinion, media
narratives, and US government policy. For this reason, they are high-value targets for
lobbying and influence activities by foreign governments and nongovernmental actors,
including those from the People’s Republic of China.

Think tanks in the United States date to the early twentieth century, when industrial
capital and private philanthropy (led by the likes of Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller,
Andrew W. Mellon, and Henry Ford) began to endow private nonprofit research
institutions at a time when there was increasing government demand for expertise on
a growing range of public policy issues. Over the past century, think tanks have come
to play ever more vital roles in the American public policy process, and they contribute
both directly and indirectly to public education, a richer public dialogue via the
media, greater civic engagement, and better-informed government policy formulation.

Of the approximately 1,800 think tanks in the United States today, about half are
research institutions located within US universities. For the purpose of this section,
however, only those think tanks located in nonuniversity private sector settings are
considered. Most of these think tanks and research institutions enjoy tax-exempt
status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which stipulates that
they are restricted from legislative lobbying as “action organizations.” Institutions that
receive this tax-exempt status must either be charitable philanthropic organizations or
research organizations (think thanks) that operate in a supposedly nonpartisan way
and in the general public interest. Because they are largely privately funded through
donor contributions, US think tanks compete tenaciously for support, professional
expertise, and public impact.

Roles of Think Tanks in American Society

The universe of think tanks in the United States is very diverse, and each think tank
performs different missions for different audiences and clients through different means
of output. Four roles are especially relevant to discussions of Chinese interest and
potential influence seeking.

The first and most important role is educating the public and better informing the

“policy community.” The majority of mainstream think tanks consciously perform
these functions through a variety of mechanisms: publishing books, articles in

COMPENSATION-RELATED POLICIES
COMPENSATION RECOVERY (“CLAWBACK”) POLICY

In 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee approved the adoption of a “clawback” policy, which would provide for the clawback
or recoupment of any compensation granted, earned, or vested that is tied to performance metrics, in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from
material noncompliance with certain financial reporting requirements that reveals that such performance (or level of performance) was not achieved.

POLICY REGARDING HEDGING AND PLEDGING OF COMPANY STOCK

Carvana’s insider trading policy prohibits all employees from buying or selling Carvana securities while aware of material nonpublic
information and prohibits the disclosure of material nonpublic information to others who then trade in our securities. As part of this policy, certain other
Carvana-securities-related transactions by directors, officers and other employees are also prohibited or subject to specific notice and pre-approval
requirements. The policy is premised on the belief that even in those circumstances where the proposed transaction may not constitute a violation of law or
applicable regulations, it is nonetheless inappropriate for any director, officer, or other employee to engage in short-term or speculative transactions in our
securities which may be viewed as reducing their incentive to improve our performance or inconsistent with the objectives of our stockholders in general.
Therefore, it is our policy that directors, officers, and other employees may not engage in any transactions involving our securities which constitute short
sales, puts, calls, or other similar derivative securities. The policy also prohibits certain other transactions, including hedging or monetization transactions—
e.g., zero-cost collars, forward sale contracts, and arrangements pledging company securities as collateral for a loan (without adequate assurance of other
available assets to satisfy the loan).

COMPENSATION AND RISK

We believe that our compensation programs create appropriate incentives to drive sustained, long-term increases in shareholder value. These
programs have been designed and administered in a manner that discourages undue risk-taking by employees. Relevant features of these programs include:

* Focus on weighting compensation toward four-year and greater vesting schedules of equity awards;

Subject: Fwd:

To: Melanie Spinell

Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but Im encouraged and glad for
you. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before
him. what would you like me to tell Barry?

There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you
like ). Brad wechsler was never up to the task . sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a
long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and
Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get
him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, | He complained for over a year , re his
direction by eileen and ada , and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of
warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told
you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for
me and that brad needs to pays him .

. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. :

I have taken heat for years over the fact that 1 gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up

questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. (that was Eileen _) but
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . _ when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect
you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really
dangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes , was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no
responsibility for him,and 1YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM |!!! , your response was that was my opinion
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he
too is still there, and a waste of money and space.

My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign
funds repatriation plan that 1 had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess.

That being said, the tasks at hand are the following.

You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would
be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??!. Iam
concermed re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn
ACCURATE .. org charts. books , balance sheets . trust valuations. are alla part. Barry will need 2 months
to just get his arm around what is there , this is before any needed modifications.,

do with compartmentalization of
Hezbollah's covert activities. It is also,
however, a result of the group's multiple
identities -- Lebanese, pan-Shiite, pro-
Iranian -- and the group's multiple and
sometimes competing goals tied to these
different identities.

Hezbollah's ideological commitment to
Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
revolutionary doctrine of velayat-e

fagih (guardianship of the jurist), which
holds that a Shiite Islamic cleric should
serve as the supreme head of government,
is a key source of conflict. The group is
thus simultaneously committed to the
decrees of Iranian clerics, the Lebanese
state, its sectarian Shiite community within
Lebanon, and fellow Shiites abroad.

The consequences of these competing
ideological drivers was clear in July 2006,
when Hezbollah dragged Israel and
Lebanon into a war neither state wanted by
crossing the U.N.-demarcated border
between the two countries, killing three
Israeli soldiers, and kidnapping two more

Neil Gershenfeld

Neil Gershenfeld is a physicist and director of MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms. He is
the author of FAB, co-author (with Alan Gershenfeld & Joel Cutcher-Gershenfeld) of
Designing Reality, and founder of the global fab lab network.

Discussions about artificial intelligence have been oddly ahistorical. They could better
be described as manic-depressive; depending on how you count, we’re now in the fifth
boom-bust cycle. Those swings mask the continuity in the underlying progress and the
implications for where it’s headed.

The cycles have come in roughly decade-long waves. First there were
mainframes, which by their very existence were going to automate away work. That ran
into the reality that it was hard to write programs to do tasks that were simple for people
to do. Then came expert systems, which were going to codify and then replace the
knowledge of experts. These ran into difficulty in assembling that knowledge and
reasoning about cases not already covered. Perceptrons sought to get around these
problems by modeling how the brain learns, but they were unable to do much of
anything. Multilayer perceptrons could handle test problems that had tripped up those
simpler networks, but their demonstrations did poorly on unstructured, real-world
problems. We’re now in the deep-learning era, which is delivering on many of the early
AI promises but 1n a way that’s considered hard to understand, with consequences
ranging from intellectual to existential threats.

Each of these stages was heralded as a revolutionary advance over the limitations
of its predecessors, yet all effectively do the same thing: They make inferences from
observations. How these approaches relate can be understood by how they scale—that is,
how their performance depends on the difficulty of the problem they’re addressing. Both
a light switch and a self-driving car must determine their operator’s intentions, but the
former has just two options to choose from, whereas the latter has many more. The AI-
boom phases have started with promising examples in limited domains; the bust phases
came with the failure of those demonstrations to handle the complexity of less-structured,
practical problems.

Less apparent is the steady progress we’ve made in mastering scaling. This
progress rests on the technological distinction between linear and exponential functions—
a distinction that was becoming evident at the dawn of AI but with implications for AI
that weren’t appreciated until many years later.

In one of the founding documents of the study of intelligent machines, 7he
Human Use of Human Beings, Norbert Wiener does a remarkable job of identifying many
of the most significant trends to arise since he wrote it, along with noting the people
responsible for them and then consistently failing to recognize why these people’s work
proved to be so important. Wiener is credited with creating the field of cybernetics; ve
never understood what that is, but what’s missing from the book is at the heart of how AI
has progressed. This history matters because of the echoes of it that persist to this day.

Claude Shannon makes a cameo appearance in the book, in the context of his
thoughts about the prospects for a chess-playing computer. Shannon was doing

* The annual Alternative Sexualities conference. This is a comparatively new effort
from the Community-Academic Consortium for Research on Alternative Sexualities.
They describe it as a conference for clinicians and researchers, addressing issues around
BDSM/Kink sexualities and consensual non-monogamies. 2012 will mark the fifth
Conference on Alternative Sexualities. I was on a panel at the 2009 conference in
Chicago, and I thought it was pretty awesome, but I am obviously biased.

* Community workshops. Most BDSM communities in large cities have educational
workshops. These teach SM-related ideas or skills such as community etiquette, how to
use various types of equipment, etc. Every SM workshop I have ever attended has
emphasized careful negotiation and has, at the very least, mentioned safewords. One
workshop -- The Emotional Aspects of BDSM Play, taught by San Francisco's
EduKink -- gave a detailed list of ideas for how to tell BDSM from abuse, which I wrote
down:

1) Consent. BDSM is consenting; abuse is not.

a) Assuming consent was given -- was it informed consent? Did everyone know what they
were consenting to?

b) Was consent coerced or seduced from the partner? Did everyone feel like they could
say no if they wanted? Was anyone worried about suffering negative consequences if they
said no?

2) Intent. A BDSM partner intends to have a mutually enjoyable encounter; an abusive
partner does not.

a) Did everyone leave the scene feeling somewhat satisfied?

3) Damage. A BDSM partner tries to minimize the actual damage inflicted by their
actions; an abusive partner does not.

a) Did the two partners learn what they were doing before they did it? Did they learn
how to perform their activities safely?

b) Were the partners aware of the potential risks of their activities?

4) Secrecy. Abuse often happens in secret. This is the hardest one on this checklist,
because -- due to the fact that BDSM is a very marginalized, misunderstood sexuality --
BDSM often happens in secret, too. But this is one of the benefits of having an entire
subculture that deals with BDSM: we try to look out for each other.

a) Were the two partners involved in the local BDSM scene? Did they get advice from
knowledgeable, understanding BDSM people during rough patches in their relationship?

I've heard of one or two workshops specifically focused on BDSM for Survivors. I've
also heard of support groups for BDSM-identified survivors of abuse, but I've never run
across one in person. I've said this before, but I'll say it again: I believe that the safest
place to have a BDSM relationship is within the BDSM community.

in a national campaign, and who, before Trump, ran a small-time, down-ballot polling
firm, understood full well that, post-campaign, she would now be one of the leading
conservative voices on cable news.

In fact, one of the Trump campaign pollsters, John McLaughlin, had begun to suggest
within the past week or so that some key state numbers, heretofore dismal, might actually
be changing to Trump’s advantage. But neither Conway nor Trump himself nor his son-in-
law Jared Kushner—the effective head of the campaign, or the designated family monitor
of 1it—wavered in their certainty: their unexpected adventure would soon be over.

Only Steve Bannon, in his odd-man view, insisted the numbers would break in their
favor. But this being Bannon’s view—crazy Steve—it was quite the opposite of being a
reassuring one.

Almost everybody in the campaign, still an extremely small outfit, thought of
themselves as a clear-eyed team, as realistic about their prospects as perhaps any in
politics. The unspoken agreement among them: not only would Donald Trump not be
president, he should probably not be. Conveniently, the former conviction meant nobody
had to deal with the latter issue.

As the campaign came to an end, Trump himself was sanguine. He had survived the
release of the Billy Bush tape when, in the uproar that followed, the RNC had had the gall
to pressure him to quit the race. FBI director James Comey, having bizarrely hung Hillary

“IT can be the most famous man in the world,” Trump told his on-again, off-again aide
Sam Nunberg at the outset of the campaign.

“But do you want to be president?” Nunberg asked (a qualitatively different question
than the usual existential candidate test: “Why do you want to be president?”). Nunberg
did not get an answer.

The point was, there didn’t need to be an answer because he wasn’t going to be
president.

Trump’s longtime friend Roger Ailes liked to say that if you wanted a career in
television, first run for president. Now Trump, encouraged by Ailes, was floating rumors
about a Trump network. It was a great future.

He would come out of this campaign, Trump assured Ailes, with a far more powerful
brand and untold opportunities. “This is bigger than I ever dreamed of,” he told Ailes in a
conversation a week before the election. “I don’t think about losing because it isn’t losing.
We’ve totally won.” What’s more, he was already laying down his public response to
losing the election: /t was stolen!

cations systems that the NSA had penetrated in Russia and China.
This could account for how he managed to acquire the necessary
passwords to accrue privileged information. It could also account for
why the documents he copied that pertained to NSA operations in
Russia were not among those he gave to Poitras, Greenwald, and
other journalists. Because Russia has had an active intelligence-
sharing treaty with China since 1996, it could further explain why
his first stop was Hong Kong, a part of China. It was a safe venue for
debriefing Snowden, as well as establishing his credentials among
journalists as a whistle-blower, before a decision was made to allow
him to proceed to Russia.

The nearly fatal problem with this early recruitment scenario is
Snowden’s contacts with journalists. Snowden, it will be recalled,
had contacted Greenwald in December 2012. Greenwald was a high-
profile blogger in Brazil who did not use encryption or any security
safeguards. Next, he contacted Poitras in January 2013 in Berlin;
she was a magnet for NSA dissidents. Both of these contacts put

© Snowden’s clandestine downloading at grave risk. As known oppo- ©
nents of U.S. intelligence agencies, these journalists might be, as they
themselves suspected they were, under surveillance by American,
British, Brazilian, or German intelligence services. Greenwald and
Poitras might also tell others who were either under surveillance or
informers. So no matter what precautions Snowden took, his secret
enterprise, or just the fact he was in contact with anti-government
activists, might be detected. At minimum, he could lose his access to
secrets and be of no further use as a source at the NSA. He could also
be interrogated and reveal the way he was brought under control. If
Snowden had actually been under the control of the Russian intel-
ligence service, the last thing it would allow was for him to take such
a risk—or even to contact a single journalist. After all, the purpose
of an espionage operation is to steal secrets without alerting anyone
to the theft.

I'd felt (and I'd known others who felt) this way after the dissolution of a sexual

apply to BDSM as well as sex. I hadn't anticipated that I'd feel such heartbreaking,

BDSM Roles, Topping From The Bottom, and Service Top

I often say that all consensual sexuality is okay. Open relationships? S&M? Same-sex
partnerships? One-night stands? Porn? I could care less how people have sex, as long as
the people involved are consenting adults. This means that most of the interesting and
important questions are about consent: how do we make sure that we always have
consensual sex? How do we ensure that we're always respecting our own boundaries and
our partners’ boundaries? How do we talk about our preferences and our consent? I write
a lot about sexual communication for this reason.

Every once in a while, though, there's something interesting to discuss besides consent.
(Totally weird, I know!) One of those interesting things is stereotypes. Also interesting:
bad dynamics in the BDSM community.

in maneuvering heavy objects. The more that people know about the robot, the easier it
is to coordinate with it.

Achieving action compatibility will require robots to anticipate human actions,
account for how those actions will influence their own, and enable people to anticipate
robot actions. Research has ,ade a degree of progress in meeting these challenges, but we
still have a long way to go.

The Value Alignment Problem: People hold the key to the robot’s reward function.
Progress on enabling robots to optimize reward puts more burden on us, the designers, to
give them the right reward to optimize in the first place. The original thought was that
for any task we wanted the robot to do, we could write down a reward function that
incentivizes the right behavior. Unfortunately, what often happens is that we specify
some reward function and the behavior that emerges out of optimizing it isn’t what we
want. Intuitive reward functions, when combined with unusual instances of a task, can
lead to unintuitive behavior. You reward an agent in a racing game with a score in the
game, and in some cases it finds a loophole that it exploits to gain infinitely many points
without actually winning the race. Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig give a beautiful
example in their book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach: rewarding a
vacuuming robot for how much dust it sucks in results in the robot deciding to dump out
dust so that it can suck it in again and get more reward.

In general, humans have had a notoriously difficult time specifying exactly what
they want, as exemplified by all those genie legends. An AI paradigm in which robots
get some externally specified reward fails when that reward is not perfectly well thought
out. It may incentivize the robot to behave in the wrong way and even resist our attempts
to correct its behavior, as that would lead to a lower specified reward.

A seemingly better paradigm might be for robots to optimize for what we
internally want, even if we have trouble explicating it. They would use what we say and
do as evidence about what we want, rather than interpreting it literally and taking it as a
given. When we write down a reward function, the robot should understand that we
might be wrong: that we might not have considered all facets of the task; that there’s no
guarantee that said reward function will a/ways lead to the behavior we want. The robot
should integrate what we wrote down into its understanding of what we want, but it
should also have a back-and-forth with us to elicit clarifying information. It should seek
our guidance, because that’s the only way to optimize the true desired reward function.

Even if we give robots the ability to learn what we want, an important question
remains that AI alone won’t be able to answer. We can make robots try to align with a
person’s internal values, but there’s more than one person involved here. The robot has
an end-user (or perhaps a few, like a personal robot caring for a family, a car driving a
few passengers to different destinations, or an office assistant for an entire team); it has a
designer (or perhaps a few); and it interacts with society—the autonomous car shares the
road with pedestrians, human-driven vehicles, and other autonomous cars. How to
combine these people’s values when they might be in conflict is an important problem we
need to solve. AI research can give us the tools to combine values in any way we decide
but can’t make the necessary decision for us.

to run his friend’s campaign with incredulity that Trump’s offer had turned out to be the
ultimate opportunity. Trump’s rise to power, Ailes understood, was the improbable
triumph of many things that Ailes and Fox News represented. After all, Ailes was perhaps
the person most responsible for unleashing the angry-man currents of Trump’s victory: he
had invented the right-wing media that delighted in the Trump character.

Ailes, who was a member of the close circle of friends and advisers Trump frequently
called, found himself hoping he would get more time with the new president once he and
Beth moved to Palm Beach; he knew Trump planned to make regular trips to Mar-a-Lago,
down the road from Ailes’s new home. Still, though Ailes was well aware that in politics,
winning changes everything—the winner is the winner—he couldn’t quite get his head
around the improbable and bizarre fact that his friend Donald Trump was now president of
the United States.

At nine-thirty, three hours late, a good part of the dinner already eaten, Bannon finally
arrived. Wearing a disheveled blazer, his signature pairing of two shirts, and military
fatigues, the unshaven, overweight sixty-three-year-old joined the other guests at the table
and immediately took control of the conversation. Pushing a proffered glass of wine away

“T don’t drink’—he dived into a live commentary, an urgent download of information
about the world he was about to take over.

“We’re going to flood the zone so we have every cabinet member for the next seven
days through their confirmation hearings,” he said of the business-and-military 1950s-type
cabinet choices. “Tillerson is two days, Session is two days, Mattis is two days... .”

Bannon veered from “Mad Dog” Mattis—the retired four-star general whom Trump
had nominated as secretary of defense—to a long riff on torture, the surprising liberalism
of generals, and the stupidity of the civilian-military bureaucracy. Then it was on to the
looming appointment of Michael Flynn—a favorite Trump general who’d been the
opening act at many Trump rallies—as the National Security Advisor.

“He’s fine. He’s not Jim Mattis and he’s not John Kelly ... but he’s fine. He just needs
the right staff around him.” Still, Bannon averred: “When you take out all the never-
Trump guys who signed all those letters and all the neocons who got us in all these wars
... It’s not a deep bench.”

Bannon said he’d tried to push John Bolton, the famously hawkish diplomat, for the
job as National Security Advisor. Bolton was an Ailes favorite, too.

“He’s a bomb thrower,” said Ailes. “And a strange little fucker. But you need him.
Who else is good on Israel? Flynn is a little nutty on Iran. Tillerson”—the secretary of
state designate—“just knows oil.”

Complexity is a more general and variously defined descriptive expression
than that of the topological and metric entropies and as such brings with it many
kinds of definitions and computational approaches. One choice that’s intuitively
appealing assumes that the relative complexity of an expression representing, say
an outcome of an observation or experiment, is reflected in the minimum length of
the most compressed program (algorithm) from which, given a suitable dictionary of
symbolic equivalencies, one can reconstitute the original expression. Increases in
what some have called algorithmic complexity, AC, are reflected in the growth of
this minimally descriptive symbol series length. Karen Selz’s approach to
compression and AC, similar to one proposed by Paul Rapp, involves the
identification and symbolic representation of repeated blocks of symbols called
words. For example, given an_ arbitrary, exemplifying binary — series:
011011101010001010101001001010011, we first find the longest repeated word
[1010100] and represent it with the symbol, a, yielding a shortening in the original
series, 011011a010a1010011. The next longest repeated word is [011] is replaced
with b, yielding a further compression, 66a010a1010b. The next remaining binary
word is of length equal to the previous one, [010], which, when replaced by c results
in the series bbacat1cb. This can be further compressed to the final representation
with four symbols and for the sequentially repeated b, one exponent of degree two,
b*aca1cb. From this representation and a dictionary of letter equivalent words, the
original binary expression can be recovered. For a quantitative index of the
algorithmic complexity, AC, of the compression, Selz computes the sum of the
number of distinct symbols plus the sum of the natural logarithms of the exponents:
4 + log (2) = 4.6931. The binary representation of 729, 1011011001, discussed
above, is compressed by making two [101]’s = a and two 0’s = b resulting in a71b*1.
Having three distinct symbols, a,o, and 1, and two exponents of two, its algorithmic

complexity is equal to, AC = 3 + 2 x log(2) = 4.38.

rude or anything. And let’s put up the video because you

RLK: China is extremely sensitive during this particular
time of the 19th CPC National Congress. They do that for all

national meetings but this is probably the most central time.

All elements of media are under strictures. Who knows at
what level decisions are made? But even internet
connections this week have been terrible because of
extreme censorship. I expect that will lessen in the future.
But it is endemic of the situation and we will all learn to live
with it. As I said, there’s a larger picture here about what Xi
is going to do in terms of his people orientation,
rejuvenating China, comprehensively deepening reform,
and strengthening rule of law.

was so deeply offended by the image at issue that it blinded them to the obvious public nature of a
union election. It was a hard case that made bad law. Fortunately the bad law it made has not
been followed in other cases involving less disturbing images.

I understand how Bowman must have felt when several years later I was victimized by a cartoon
that was similar to the one at issue in her case. It was commissioned by Norman Finkelstein and
used to illustrate an article he wrote calling for my assassination. It was a full-color cartoon by a
South American neo-Nazi portraying me as watching the Israeli Army kill Lebanese civilians. It
had me sitting in front of the television and masturbating in ecstasy over the civilian bodies strewn
on the ground. Since I am clearly a public figure, and since this was plainly a parody, it was
protected speech under the First Amendment. To be a First Amendment lawyer requires
developing thick skin.

Privacy- The right to be left alone

The right of the media to publish purely private though truthful information was the subject, more
than 100 years ago, of a classic law review article co-authored by Louis Brandeis, who eventually
became one of the “founding fathers” of the 20 Century rebirth of the First Amendment. As a
young lawyer, Brandeis was concerned about how local tabloids were publishing gossip about
prominent people, including members of his own partner’s family. He and his partner wrote “The
Right to Privacy” in the Harvard Law Review (1890) in which they set out this new right to “be
let alone,” which they analogized , at least superficially, to the law of defamation. Remarkably,
especially in light of subsequent developments, Brandeis did not seem particularly sensitive to
how his new right of privacy might conflict with the old right of the press to publish scandalous
material.

The conflict between privacy and publication becomes particularly sensitive when they privacy at
issue relates to minors. I have been involved in several such cases. One of them pitted the right
of Brook Shields to prevent the publication of nude photographs taken of her when she was 10
years old against the right of the man who “owned” the photos to publish them.

When Brooke Shields was 10, her ambitious mother Teri signed a contract with an equally
ambitious photographer to photograph Brooke naked, taking a bath. Brooke was paid $450 for
the photo sessions by Playboy Press, and her mother signed a release giving the photographer the
unlimited right to publish the photographs anywhere and at any time.

Seven years later, as Brooke was about the enter Princeton as a freshman, the photographer
decided to exploit her fame by producing a calendar featuring naked pictures of the 10 year old.
Brooke was upset that any such calendar would circulate among her fellow students at Princeton
and would cause her great embarrassment.

She hired a former student of mine to try to negotiate with the photographer to buy back the
rights, and if that failed, to try to prevent publication of the photographs. My former student
sought my advice on the matter. I told him it would be an uphill fight to try to enjoin the
publication of the pictures, because they were not obscene and because prior restraint is always
disfavored by the law.

you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really
dangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes , was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no
responsibility for him,and 1YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM |!!! , your response was that was my opinion
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he
too is still there, and a waste of money and space.

make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess.

That being said, the tasks at hand are the following.

You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would
be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??!. Iam
concermed re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn

that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense , in fact I take comfort in the fact that after
only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more.

Case No.: CACE 15-000072

Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 8 of 20

Because the Government now contested the joinder motion, Edwards and
Cassell prepared a more detailed pleading explaining the justification for granting the
motion. One week after receiving the Government’s objection, on December 30, 2014, Ms.
Giuffre (i.e., Jane Doe No. 3) and Jane Doe No. 4 filed a motion (and later a corrected motion)
seeking to join the case. DE 279 and DE 280. (Note: DE 280 is the first of the three documents
Dershowitz seeks to have declared “confidential” in this case.) Uncertain as to the basis for the
Government’s objection, the motion briefly proffered the circumstances that would qualify
the two women as “victims” eligible to assert rights under the CVRA. See 18 U.S.C. 3771(e)
(defining “crime victim” protected under the Act). With regard to Ms. Giuffre, the motion
indicated that when she was a minor, Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to Dershowitz and Prince
Andrew (among others) for sexual purposes. Jane Doe No. 3 stated that she was prepared to
prove her proffer. See DE 280 at 3 (“If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe No. 3 would prove
the following . .. . “). The motion also provided specific reasons why Jane Doe No. 3’s
participation was relevant to the case, including the pending discovery issues regarding
Dershowitz and Prince Andrew. DE 280 at 9-10 (explaining several reasons participation of new
victims was relevant to existing issues).

After the motion was filed, various news organizations published articles about
it. Dershowitz also made numerous media statements about the filing, including calling Jane
Doe No. 3 “a serial liar” who “has lied through her teeth about many world

leaders.” —_ http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/us/dershowitz-sex-allegation/, Dershowitz also

repeatedly called Edwards and Cassell “two sleazy, unprofessional, disbarable lawyers.” Jd On

Cls in the mainstream Chinese studies curricula on US campuses to date. (See below
for our recommendations concerning CIs.)

Chinese Students and Scholars Associations

Chinese Students and Scholars Associations (CSSA) on American campuses maintain
regular contact with China’s diplomatic missions in the US. Even when these contacts
are purely for cultural purposes, the CSSA provides a ready channel or entry point

for the political departments of China’s embassy and consulates in the US to gather
information and coordinate action, which in some cases includes pressuring the
behavior of Chinese students. Sometimes pressure is even applied by China’s security
services on the family members of those students it finds speaking out in unacceptable
ways back in China. What is more, Chinese scholars and diplomats have sought to
influence on-campus debates in China’s favors and have even protested when American
universities have exercised their right to invite speakers whom China identifies as
unfriendly. Finally, some Chinese students and scholars have exploited the collaborative
research environment on US campuses to obtain sensitive American technologies.

Chinese Students and Scholars Associations now exist on approximately 150 US
campuses.” A second type of on-campus association has also recently started up,

the China Development Student Think Tank (CDSTT), with chapters at Syracuse
University, Boston University, and George Washington University. As voluntary
associations of Chinese citizens on campus, these groups perform many appropriate
social functions, such as orienting new students to life in the United States and
arranging networking get-togethers. Nonetheless, their links with Chinese diplomatic
missions and some of their activities, because of their attempts to interfere with
other campus activities and broader political discourse and debate, present cause for
concern. CSSAs at Washington, DC, universities make no secret of their ties to the
Chinese embassy and receive small amounts of operating funds directly from it. CSSAs
elsewhere have similar ties to nearby Chinese consulates, which also provide them
with funding, other kinds of support, and surveillance. It has also been reported that
Chinese Communist Party cells have been established on several US campuses.*°

CSSAs often alert PRC diplomatic missions about events on campus that offend official
PRC political sensitivities, e.g., speeches or discussions on Tibet, Taiwan, Xinjiang, human
rights, and Chinese elite politics. Once notified, the local PRC mission has sometimes
contacted university faculty or staff members to prevent such events from proceeding.

In some instances, it is difficult to know whether opposition to events originates with

a CSSA or the local PRC mission. In 2017, the CSSA at the University of California San
Diego mobilized opposition to the chancellor’s invitation to the Dalai Lama to be the
commencement speaker, which at least some CSSA members ultimately coordinated with
the PRC consulate in Los Angeles.” After the event finally took place anyway as planned,

Summary
With the global
economy
continuing to
muddle through,
we believe that
US corporate
bonds offer the
best risk return.
• Economy
The successful formation of a Greek government after the June 17 elections has reduced
the risk of an imminent Greek exit from the Eurozone. However, the Euro debt crisis
persists, and further reform and consolidation efforts in Spain and Italy are needed. In the
US, economic data weakened recently, but it remains in line with our forecast of moderate
growth of around 2% in 2012. The Fed extended Operation Twist until the end of the
year and is ready to do more if the economic situation deteriorates materially. Meanwhile,
Chinese activity data is showing signs of stabilization and inflation remains low. We expect
the Chinese economy to gradually pick up in the second half of 2012.
• Equities
Despite our relatively positive outlook for US and Chinese economic growth, ongoing
Eurozone issues keep us neutral on global equities. We think US companies are better
positioned than their European peers, and thus keep our longer-standing preference for
US equities. US earnings are relatively robust and the recovery of the domestic economy
continues to support revenues. Furthermore, we keep a moderate overweight in emerging
market (EM) equities as valuations are attractive and we expect growth to accelerate in
the second half of the year. In the near term EM currency weakness remains a risk factor.
• Fixed Income
High grade government bond yields remain extremely low due to ultra-expansive
monetary policy and ongoing investor concerns over global growth. While we expect
yields to only rise very gradually in the near term, we continue to see better investment
opportunities in other fixed income segments. US high yield remains our favorite asset
class, given attractive valuations and a favorable default outlook. We also keep our
overweight recommendations on investment grade and EM bonds.
• Commodities
We avoid broad commodity exposure as we see further price weakness ahead. While the
worst of the oil sell-off is likely behind us, we see no reason for higher prices in the near
term and expect roll costs to weigh on positions.
• Foreign Exchange
In light of the ongoing Eurozone troubles, we continue to prefer the US dollar over the
euro. We also prefer the Canadian dollar, given its relatively good growth dynamics, a
possible rate hike, and relatively high short rates.

Please see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.
Preferred themes
• High quality dividend yields (sourced from existing European
and UK equities)
High quality companies with geographically diversified business models
that pay sustainable dividends offer an attractive income stream in a
low yield world. Historically, dividends have made a substantial
contribution to total returns, and we expect this to remain the case in
the current environment.
• Western winners from emerging market growth (sourced from
existing equity holdings)
Emerging economies continue to grow faster than developed
economies. With little need to deleverage and repair balance sheets,
Asian economies are also well positioned to continue to outpace their
Western peers in the years ahead. We have identified companies from a
variety of sectors in Europe, the US and Japan which have significant
exposure to the rapidly growing emerging regions. We believe a
diversified portfolio of these companies will reward investors seeking
to profit from the robust demand growth in emerging economies.
• Natural gas growth gainers
Natural gas is a relatively clean source of energy, and we think it will
benefit from continued substitution for other energy sources over the
long term. We have examined the dynamics of the global market and
the various components of the gas value chain, and identified the areas
we see as the most significant beneficiaries currently. These include
producers in Europe and Asia, suppliers of infrastructure, services and
related machinery, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) in the US,
that offer both attractive yields and growth.
• Government bond alternatives (sourced from government bonds
–CIO UW)
Developed world government bonds offer a comparatively small cushion
against future interest rate hikes and many face increasing credit risk. We
expect select bonds of supranational or national agencies, sub-national
governments, multinational corporates, and covered bonds to
outperform government bonds. We recommend switching out of
government bonds into these alternatives.
• US high yield corporate bonds (sourced from government bonds –
CIO UW)
Positive economic growth, robust corporate earnings and healthy
balance sheets provide support to US high yield corporate bonds. Current
yield spreads of roughly 660 basis points still price in a much more dire
economic outcome than we expect. Historically, US high yield bonds have
delivered similar returns to US equities with lower volatility. We continue
to believe that US high yield corporate bonds represent a more favorable
risk/return potential than equities and expect total returns of
approximately 7% over the next 6 months.
• The place to be in Hedge Funds
Recent economic data has shown signs of improvement, but growth in
most developed markets remains muted. In this environment, less
directional hedge fund strategies, such as relative value and event driven,
should offer above average returns.
• EM corporates: a growing asset class (sourced from global
government bonds – CIO UW)
Given our relatively constructive current view on risk, we regard EM
corporate debt as more attractive than EM sovereign debt due to its
higher overall yield. Over a 6-month horizon, we expect EM corporate
bonds to outperform US Treasuries and deliver total returns of close to
8% p.a.

Global economic outlook
–
Summary
Key questions
• Can emerging markets (EM) continue to offset developed market (DM) weakness to buoy global
growth?
• What are the risks of near-term faltering of the US economic recovery?
• When is the European economy likely to return to sustainable economic expansion?
CIO View (Probability: 60%*)
• Global economic activity remains moderate; the growth impulse stems largely (some 80%) from the EM
region. As expected, China started to ease monetary policy. The country is better placed than other EM
and particularly DM countries to counter growth weakness with further monetary and fiscal stimuli. Thus,
we expect EM growth to stabilize soon and pick up in 2H 2012.
• US economic indicators have on balance been disappointing recently, especially data related to business
fixed investment and employment growth. Thus, we lowered our 2Q 2012 real GDP growth forecast to an
annualized rate of 1.5% from 2%. We still expect growth slightly above 2% in 2H 2012. We think that the
risk that the Fed will take measures in addition to the extension of Operation Twist is still significant.
• Large parts of Western Europe are in recession or stagnation. We expect the economies of the Eurozone
and the UK to show mild improvement in 2H 2012. Still, economic activity is likely to remain very sluggish
despite support from lower oil prices and less rigorous fiscal austerity. The Bank of England may support
the UK economy by increasing its amount of bond purchases soon. The probability that the ECB will take
further action to support the economy has risen significantly.
� Positive scenario (Probability: 15%*)
• The Eurozone crisis abates. Financial market conditions recover, mitigating the drag from fiscal austerity.
• Growth in Western Europe is marginally positive (Eurozone stagnates) in 2012 and the US economy
grows moderately above trend.
� Negative scenario (Probability: 25%*)
• There are three key downside risks to the global economy: 1. a significant escalation of the Eurozone
debt crisis; 2. a sharp fiscal contraction in the US, and 3. a sharp deceleration of the Chinese economy. Each
one of these risks could precipitate a significant downturn of the global economy.

Key financial market driver 1 –
Eurozone crisis
Key questions
• What is the way forward for Eurozone banks?
• What is the most likely course of events in Spain, Italy and Portugal?
• In what direction will the economy and the ECB go?
CIO View (Probability: 65%*)
Austerity and weak growth
• Support for the banking sector is a major political agenda item, and the request for external support for
Spanish banks can be seen as the starting point for greater European support and oversight for banks, to
be discussed at the upcoming European Council.
• Greece's debt remains unsustainable, but the risk of a euro exit over the next six months has diminished
after the 17 June elections, which have produced a viable government coalition. The Troika may only
accept moderate adjustments to the second Greek package. Portugal is likely to receive an increased
bailout package and is unlikely to default in 2012. Progress on reforms and consolidation in Spain and Italy
is most crucial for the near-term development of the crisis. Risk premiums would rise strongly on any
failure to meet deficit targets; we expect bond risk premiums to remain elevated for Spain and Italy over
the next six months.
• Following stagnation in 1Q 2012, economic surveys are commensurate with a quarterly GDP contraction
of around 0.3% at present. Business survey evidence points to a general wait and see mode. The risk to the
outlook for a stabilization of economic growth in the second half of 2012 is skewed to the downside. The
ECB remains on hold, but the bar to support the economy and markets has been lowered substantially. We
see a significant probability of policy action in early July, including the possibility of a rate reduction.
Despite all the talk about political measures to support growth and increased tolerance for budget
slippages, there is practically no leeway for fiscal stimuli. The near-term growth impact of any fiscal
measure will at best be marginal, in our view.
� Positive scenario (Probability: 15%*)
Return to macro stability
• Bond yields are contained, as peripheral countries' budgets stay on track and economic activity recovers
faster than expected. Greece fully complies with the austerity plans and receives further support. Market
confidence is restored, and economic growth stagnates in 2012.
� Negative scenario (Probability: 20%*) Major shock
• Major shocks could include Spain being pushed into a full IMF/EU program, possibly by a rating cut to
junk, enhancing pressure also on Italy; serious political disagreement in core countries (for instance after
Dutch elections, etc.); a possible Portuguese default; a Greek euro exit; or a major external growth shock.

Key financial market driver 2 –
US policy
Key questions
• Will the economic outlook deteriorate? Will QE3 become necessary?
• How will the election outcome change fiscal policy deliberations?
• Can politicians find an agreement to avoid sharp fiscal contraction in early 2013 (fiscal cliff)?
CIO View (Probability: 65%*)
No QE3, political gridlock and some fiscal tightening
• The economy stays on a moderate growth path, coupled with stable core PCE inflation close to the Fed’s
target of 2%. UBS forecasts real GDP growth of 1.5% in 2Q 2012 (consensus: 2.1%) and 2.3% in 3Q 2012
(consensus: 2.4%), with some downside risk due to rising uncertainty. The Fed has decided to extend so
called Operation Twist until the end of the year. More near-term monetary easing is still possible, but it
is currently not our central scenario.
• In the elections, Republicans will likely lose seats in the House overall, but retain a majority; we also
expect them to win a narrow majority in the Senate. Obama will likely retain the White House. Such an
electoral outcome would confirm the existing gridlock between Republicans and Democrats.
• Against the backdrop of ongoing political gridlock, we expect only moderate fiscal tightening of about
0.9% of GDP in 2013. The government will likely let unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut expire,
but postpone income tax hikes and sequestration spending.
� Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*) No QE3, Democratic sweep and more fiscal tightening
• Propelled by ultra-expansive monetary policy and improved confidence, cyclical forces surmount the
structural hindrances and thus growth accelerates. More rapid growth leads to higher inflation, and the
Fed responds by tightening monetary policy sooner.
• The improved economic outlook raises the odds for an Obama re-election and makes it harder for
Republicans to win a majority in the Senate. US fiscal consolidation efforts are facilitated by faster rising
tax collections. A Democratic stronghold leads to some tax hikes and limited spending cuts. Fiscal policy
tightens by about 1.2% of GDP in 2013.
� Negative scenario (Probability: 25%*) QE3, political dysfunction and huge fiscal tightening
• Structural hindrances dominate and weigh on the cyclical recovery, thus growth weakens or turns
negative. The Fed embarks on QE3, most likely in the form of agency MBS and Treasury purchases.
• Weaker economic conditions raise the odds for a larger Republican majority in Congress, but Obama
remains President. The debt limit is reached earlier and the Treasury runs out of money before year-end.
The political gridlock becomes dysfunctional, thus fiscal policy tightens by USD 600 billion (3.7% of UBS
estimate of 2013 GDP) in 2013 (“fiscal cliff”). The US credit rating is downgraded.

Key financial market driver 3 –
China growth outlook
Key questions
• When will the economy bottom out?
• What economic policy responses can we expect to support the economy ahead?
• How significant is the contagion risk from a possible downturn in the Eurozone?
CIO View (Probability: 70%*) Modest policy easing to support growth in 2H12
• The latest economic data suggest that economic activity is showing signs of stabilization, albeit at a
comparatively low level. However, we have yet to see meaningful pick-up in activity. We think that policy
measures to support the economy should have more visible effect on activity in the second half of the
year.
• To this effect, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has recently cut interest rates by 25bps – the first such
move since late 2008. With investment demand still sluggish, we don't expect the measure to have a
significant near-term effect on growth. Still, the cut confirms the leadership's commitment to support the
economy. Importantly, with the rate cut, measures were announced to increase the banks' ability to set
interest rates, which should bolster private household spending power in the future.
• The rate reduction took place against a backdrop of falling price inflation. Thus, inflation is no obstacle
for further measures to ease monetary policy. However, at this point we don't expect further rate cuts this
year; especially since increased interest rate flexibility should contribute to an easing of monetary
conditions ahead. If anything, we think the PBoC may implement more reductions in banks' reserve
requirement rates to ensure sufficient liquidity provisions. Thus, we think the real focus has to be on the
fiscal policy measures now, including possibly an acceleration of infrastructure investments, measures to
support consumer spending and selective relaxation in the property market (while keeping home-purchase
restrictions intact).
� Positive scenario (Probability: 20%*) Higher-than-expected growth
• Chinese GDP grows above 8.5% in 2012. For this we would probably need to see stronger-than-expected
fiscal and monetary policy support from the government. A speedy improvement in the Eurozone debt
crisis could also lead to this positive scenario.
� Negative scenario (Probability: 10%*) Hard landing
• Chinese GDP growth below 6%, i.e. a hard landing of the economy. This could be triggered by a global
financial crisis/recession, causing a slump in Chinese exports. Other risks include a sharp decline in Chinese
residential property prices – which would slow investment growth, a large-scale default of local
government debt, or a surge in inflation that forces the PBoC to significantly tighten monetary policy.

Section 2.A
Asset class views
Equities
Equities overview
Global equity markets – Key points
• We keep an overall neutral allocation to equities (see summary on slide 3).
• The US remains our preferred developed market. The domestic economy is expected to continue to
grow. This should underpin earnings growth for US companies. With labour costs in check, profit margins
should stay around the current high levels.
• We keep our overweight position on EM equities. Monetary easing in key countries continues, and
relatively attractive valuations remain key supporting factors. However, near-term economic and currency
weakness remains a major concern for investors – especially those domiciled in hard currency regions (e.g.
USD, EUR). Until year-end, we expect some growth acceleration and therefore stay overweight.
• The UK remains a preferred market. It offers a solid earnings outlook compared to other European
markets. Moreover, the valuation is attractive at a trailing P/E ratio close to 10.
• We keep our negative stance on Eurozone equities. The economy remains very weak affecting
earnings growth negatively. The sovereign debt crisis remains a major risk (see page 8).
• We remain cautious on Australian equities. The earnings prospects are still being revised down by
analysts. The domestic economy is moving at two speeds with the strong part getting its impulse from the
mining sector. We maintain a small underweight.
• We keep a moderate underweight in Swiss equities, as valuation looks expensive relative to world
equities. The negative earnings impact of the strong Swiss franc should ease further in coming quarters.
Global equity sectors – Key points
• Consumer Staples and Healthcare remain preferred among defensive sectors, as their long-term
earnings prospects are very solid. Both sectors also offer strong balance sheets, exposure to favorable
demographic trends and emerging markets.
• We keep our negative view on Telecom and Utilities. Both sectors suffer from weak revenue growth
as well as margin pressure.
• Within cyclical sectors, we keep our preference for IT due to a solid earnings outlook and strong
corporate balance sheets. Moreover, we reiterate our neutral allocation to Industrials.
• Valuations are high and earnings expectations are optimistic for Consumer Discretionary. However,
we reduce our Underweight as we become more positive on the sector in the US.
• Following the latest oil price decline and a good relative performance, we have reduced our
overweight on Energy. However, the earnings outlook remains solid and valuation is very attractive.
While Materials are not expensive, we are neutral, as margins remain under pressure.
• The earnings outlook for US and Asian Financials is solid, which leads us to be neutral on Financials
from a global perspective. However, we maintain our underweight on Eurozone Financials, where
sovereign indebtedness and bank capitalization remain major concerns.

US equities Preference: overweight
S&P 500 (27 June): 1,332 (last month: 1,319)
UBS View S&P 500 (6-month target): 1,430
• US firms on average show more resilient earnings than their global and especially European peers.
Modest domestic economic growth supports US companies' revenue and thereby earnings growth. About
two thirds of revenues are generated in the US.
• While profit margins are slightly higher than their average over the last 30 years, we expect them to hold
up in coming quarters. Pressure from rising wages on margins is rather muted. So company earnings are
forecast to develop in line with revenues.
• In the next six months, we forecast the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of the S&P 500 to rise to about 14.0x
realized earnings from slightly above 13.0x currently.
• The combination of expected moderate earnings growth and an expansion of the valuation multiples
make the US one of our preferred equity markets.
� Positive scenario S&P 500 (6-month target): 1,580
• An accelerating US and global economy reduces risks to company earnings. Investors begin to shift funds
into more cyclical sectors such as Industrials and Materials in light of better growth prospects. In this
scenario, we would expect earnings to grow by around 10% in the next 12 months, and the trailing P/E
multiple to expand to around 15x.
� Negative scenario S&P 500 (6-month target): 1,115
• The US slides into a recession and corporate earnings fall by around 15% over the coming 12 months.
Coupled with an escalation in the Eurozone debt crisis, we would expect the P/E multiple to contract
towards 12.0x trailing earnings.

• We are cautious on Materials, where we
expect margin pressure to continue, as
well as Telecom and Utilities, due to high
valuations.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)

which should benefit from robust
earnings growth in the long term (see
also slide 21).

Eurozone equities Preference: underweight
Euro Stoxx (27 June): 217 (last month: 215)
UBS View Euro Stoxx (6-month target): 223
• The crisis in the Eurozone will remain the main driver in the coming months. After the elections in
Greece, progress on the reform program will be closely monitored. Spain and Italy will also remain in the
spotlight with levels of government bond yields too high for being sustainable.
• With the sovereign debt crisis dragging on we expect the Eurozone market to stay highly volatile in
coming months.
• Economies in peripheral countries increasingly feel the burden of austerity. The economic weakness
affects company earnings negatively. Analysts' earnings growth forecasts (consensus) for 2012 have come
down to about 3% for this year, but we see this as still too high against the weak economic backdrop.
• All in all, the ongoing risks stemming from the sovereign debt crisis lead us to the view that Eurozone
equities will underperform other major markets.
� Positive scenario Euro Stoxx (6-month target): 275
• Global economic growth reaccelerates and Eurozone growth shows clear signs of bottoming out,
enabling 2–4% earnings growth over the rest of the year. The trailing P/E ratio could re-rate to 12x from
the current reading close to 10x.
� Negative scenario Euro Stoxx (6-month target): 165
• Europe slides into a deep recession, and the debt crisis leads to severe pressure on Spain and Italy. In a
major crisis, earnings could fall by 10% to 15% from current levels until year-end, and the trailing P/E ratio
could drop to 8.5x by the end of 2012.

UK equities Preference:
overweight
FTSE 100 (27 June): 5,524 (last month: 5,266)
UBS View FTSE 100 (6-month target): 5,785
• We continue to like UK equities relative to global ones. An expected improvement in the global economy
over the coming quarters should support UK companies as 70% of revenues are generated abroad.
• Energy is the largest sector of the UK market. While the oil price eased sharply over the past months, we
expect it to stabilize in the second half of 2012. An attractive valuation of the energy sector at 6.5x trailing
earnings provides some buffer for earnings volatility going forward.
• Profitability of UK banks is reasonable. They are less affected by the sovereign debt crisis than their
Eurozone peers. While the recent easing of collateral requirements by the Bank of England is supportive in
the short-term, the profitability of the domestic operations could be negatively affected by the
implementation of the ring-fencing bank reform by 2015.
• UK equities’ P/E, at about 10.0x trailing, indicates attractive value relative to global equities. Based on our
12-month forward earnings growth estimate of about 5% and the P/E multiple slightly expanding to 10.3x,
we expect UK equities to show good returns over the next six months.
� Positive scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 6,650
• Continued global growth and strong demand from emerging markets should support demand for
commodities, helping the Materials and Energy sectors to lead the market higher. The market could re-rate
to a P/E multiple of close to 12.0x, and we would expect earnings growth of 5–8% over 12 months.
� Negative scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 4,400
• A global recession drags UK earnings down by 15–20%. The market's defensive characteristics would only
partly offset its strong exposure to commodity-related sectors. We would expect the trailing P/E multiple to
drop towards slightly below 9x.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• We like the Energy sector due to
attractive valuations; Consumer Staples
is another preferred sector Because of
its defensive qualities.
• Approaching the end of the patent cliff
should remove some uncertainty on the
Healthcare sector and enable a rerating.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• As commodity-related sectors, Energy
and Materials should benefit from
robust demand in emerging markets.
• The UK market's 4% dividend yield
provides a good income stream.

UBS View SMI (6-month target): 6,200
• Swiss listed companies generate a high share of profits in economies outside Switzerland. Consequently,
the Swiss equity market is affected by the recent weakening in global growth.
• Swiss companies try to mitigate concerns on the global economic prospects by maintaining tight cost
controls. This should allow to maintain relatively robust operating margins in 2012.
• While the Swiss franc remains overvalued, we expect the currency impact to gradually become less of a
drag. In fact, at current exchange rates, Swiss companies' earnings would show some positive currency
translation effects by end 2012, compared to the previous year.
• Still, the PE-ratio of the market is relatively high compared to the global average, indicating less
attractive value. The SMI is trading at about 12.8x realized earnings. We are thus more cautious on the
ability of the market to deliver further multiple expansion in a challenging market environment. As a
result, we maintain a small underweight stance on Swiss equities.
� Positive scenario SMI (6-month target): 6,900
• Eurozone economic growth reaccelerates meaningfully, providing relief to Swiss financials as well as
Swiss exporters. Defensive sectors would likely be left behind in a relief rally. In this scenario, we would
expect the equity market P/E to re-rate to 14x and earnings to grow by 5% over the next six months.
� Negative scenario SMI (6-month target): 5,075
• The sovereign debt crisis re-escalates, leading to further downside for Swiss financials and the exportfocused
Industrials and Materials sectors. In this scenario, corporate earnings could drop by 5–10% over
the next six months and we would expect the P/E to contract significantly, toward 11.5x.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)

Japanese equities Preference: neutral
Topix (27 June): 745 (last month: 721)
UBS View Topix (6-month target): 780
• We expect earnings growth of about 45% over the coming 12 months. This exceptional high growth is
mainly due to the two natural disasters last year, as well as tax regulation changes which caused a
number of one-time losses to be booked in the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.
• In our base case scenario, we see only limited scope for an additional earnings boost from the local
economic recovery, given the slowing in export markets. Japanese companies are expected to continue
their cost reduction efforts to counter the impact of a strong yen.
• The Japanese government has started implementing its JPY 18tn recovery budget in 4Q 2011, and we
expect the budget to boost Japanese GDP by 1–1.5% in FY2012.
• Mainly due to the earnings rebound, we expect the TOPIX trailing P/E to drop from around 16.5x to 14x
– 14.5x by year end; still the earnings rebound should provide some room for moderate price increases.
� Positive scenario Topix (6-month target): 900
• Stronger global demand and stabilizing European markets provide an additional boost to earnings, and
also lead to improved risk taking. Falling risk aversion is likely to lead to a weaker yen, providing further
upside to earnings. TOPIX target is based on 16.0x trailing P/E.
� Negative scenario Topix (6-month target): 600
• Faltering global growth leads to weak exports, triggering negative earnings surprises. A strengthening
USDJPY below 75 in response to rising risk aversion might provide an additional drag on the economy and
earnings. We would then expect the P/E ratio to contract to 13.5x, even if earnings show no recovery.
What we're watching
Why it matters
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
JPY and exports The exchange rate is an important factor for the Japanese equity market, and
central bank intervention is a key swing factor. Japan’s trade balance could be in
deficit and may impact USDJPY rates. Key date: 09 July, Japanese trade
balance
BoJ’s monetary policy
board meeting
The Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) additional commitment to its asset purchase program,
which is currently JPY 65tn in size, would lead to a weaker yen, in our view. Key
date: 12 July, BoJ policy meeting
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• The earthquake in Japan and recent
floods in Thailand have impacted
Japanese earnings negatively. A recovery
from these disasters should benefit auto
and industrial stocks in particular.
• We prefer companies that continue cost
reduction initiatives to maintain price
competitiveness during the period of yen
strength.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• A weaker USDJPY may drive Japanese
companies’ earnings recovery beyond a
technical recovery from natural disasters.
• A rapidly aging population and the lack
of a powerful and stable government
remain negative for the country's longerterm
economic prospects.

Emerging market equities Preference: overweight
MSCI EM (27 June): 913 (last month: 907)
UBS View MSCI EM 6-month target: 1,000
• Currency weakness hurt emerging market (EM) equity performance in US-dollar terms year-to-date. We
expect EM FX to appreciate against the USD from current levels over a six-month horizon.
• As expected, China has started to ease monetary policy. We believe there is also room to do more on the
fiscal side, helping to support China's economic growth outlook for the second half of 2012 and into 2013.
The 2Q GDP numbers are expected to represent the low point in the current cycle.
• Given the above, in our base case, we see scope for some multiple expansion for the MSCI EM Index,
from the current 10.3x realized price-to-earnings ratio to closer to 11x over the next six months. We expect
earnings growth of around 10% over the next 12 months.
• Within EM, we believe that Asia is best positioned for economic growth in the second half of 2012. In
emerging Asia, we prefer China. In Latin America, we prefer Brazil and Mexico. Central and Eastern
Europe remains the most vulnerable region, and we remain neutral on Russia.
� Positive scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 1,190
• The outlook for the global economy improves, boosting EM's ability to grow more strongly in 2013.
Stronger economic growth leads to earnings growth of 15%. Investor confidence improves, leading to a
better P/E multiple of 12.5x trailing earnings. More cyclical Korea and Taiwan would benefit.
� Negative scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 730
• Serious negative developments (e.g. a further deterioration of the Eurozone crisis, the US fiscal cliff, or a
Chinese hard landing) hit trade and thus the economic prospects of emerging markets. In this case, we
would expect a 25% decline in earnings. More defensive Malaysia would do better, whereas more cyclical
Korea and Taiwan would underperform. We assume, however, that the market would also be expecting
some recovery in earnings for 2013, helping the P/E multiple to recover to 9.5x trailing earnings.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
What we're watching Why it matters
Emerging market Investors are trying to figure out which emerging market central banks still have
monetary policy room to ease monetary policy and where rates may be heading up. Inflation
data due for Russia (4–9 July), Brazil (7 July), China (9 July), Mexico (9
July), India (13 July), South Africa (18 July).
Oil prices & EM FX Recent declines in oil prices are helping to reverse some of the inflationary impact
of earlier rises, but the exchange rate matters, too.
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• In Asia, we expect Chinese equities to
benefit as the Chinese economy avoids a
hard landing. In Latin America, we prefer
Brazil and Mexico.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• Structural factors (e.g. stronger fiscal
position, more favorable demographics)
should continue to support stronger
economic growth than in the developed
economies.
• Strategically, we would advise a tilt in EM
portfolios toward cash-rich and fastergrowing
Asia.

Asian equities (ex-Japan) Preference: overweight
MSCI Asia ex-Japan (27 June): 469 (last month: 466)
UBS View MSCI Asia ex-Japan (6-month target): 515
• The region continued to show high volatility last month, with its P/BV temporarily close to 2008 lows.
• Hong Kong and Singapore markets' domestic fundamentals remain solid. Hong Kong should benefit
from China's gradual recovery in 2H 2012, while Singapore's economy is rebounding and corporate
balance sheets and earnings remain solid. After the rate cut early June, we expect China to have more
policies to support growth in 2H 2012. China is our most preferred market, while Indonesia is least
preferred in the region. We are more concerned about Indonesia's fiscal deficit, since the fuel price hike
did not happen. Domestic problems for Indonesia include current account deficits, potential capital
outflows, bottomed-out inflation and hiccups in economic and market reforms, in our view.
• We expect 10% earnings-per-share growth over 12 months for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan, which trades on
11.6x 12-month trailing earnings. We expect this multiple to expand slightly in the next six months, as the
current earnings downgrade cycle is approaching its end. Nevertheless, MSCI Asia ex-Japan is likely to see
further volatility in the near term due to global macro risk factors.
� Positive scenario MSCI Asia ex-Japan (6-month target): 610
• More supportive monetary and fiscal policy, stable inflation, sustained domestic demand growth, and an
improved global growth outlook should lead to a better earnings outlook. We would expect earnings
growth of 15% and a P/E based on realized earnings of 14x.
� Negative scenario MSCI APAC ex-Japan (6-month target): 380
• A hard landing in China with a global recession leads to negative earnings revisions for 2012. In this
scenario, earnings could fall 20% over 12 months and the P/E could fall to about 10.5x.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
What we're watching
Growth
Why it matters
Both HK and Singapore's GDP growth disappointed, raising concerns about the
growth momentum in the region. Investors should focus on whether growth
will re-accelerate in the near term. Key dates: 3 July, HK retail sales; 13
July, SG retail sales; 17 July, SG exports
Policy responses Some other countries in the region have structural issues due to fuel subsidies
(e.g. Indonesia) and fiscal deficits (e.g. India). Policy responses often come on an
ad hoc base.
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• We prefer Hong Kong banks, Singapore
high-dividend stocks and Chinese
insurance and consumer plays.
• We are concerned about India's inflation
pressure, but we see opportunities in the
power and banking sectors.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• Rising consumption is the long-term trend
in Asia ex-Japan that we expect will
continue to play out.
• In China, sectors that contribute to
improved labor productivity or deliver
goods and services for the elderly should
benefit from demographic changes
(ageing population and decelerating
population growth).

Equity styles
UBS View
Prefer value and large caps in Europe, mid caps in US
• We recommend that investors look for value opportunities in Europe: The cheapest stocks within each
sector are at extreme relative valuations, which should begin to normalize. Within Financials, however,
investors should limit their direct exposure to the Eurozone debt crisis. We assess the cheapness of a stock
by looking at its price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios relative to its peers.
• We believe US mid caps will outperform large caps. US economic data is forecast to stabilize and GDP
growth should be resilient in the second half of 2012. Greater domestic sales exposure reduces earnings
risk coming from Europe. In Europe, we prefer large over small caps in the current very challenging
economic environment.
• High quality dividend paying stocks provide a real and stable income stream to investors during the
current low yield environment. Furthermore, they give exposure to the long term potential of equity
markets while also providing some support in declining markets.
� Positive scenario Prefer value, low quality and small caps
• Leading indicators continue to move higher, and risks related to the Eurozone debt crisis subside. In this
case, add deep cyclical value (cheap price/book, price/earnings) regardless of sector, with high beta and
high leverage. In such an environment, small- and mid-cap stocks should also perform well, but a dividend
strategy would be too defensive to outperform the market.
� Negative scenario Prefer quality and large caps
• The global economic picture deteriorates markedly. In this case, buy high-quality growth companies and
large caps. Do not look for value opportunities, but be as defensive as possible with your equity exposure.
Look to high-quality, dividend-paying stocks for yield.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7).
What we're watching
Earnings revisions – see
chart
(3-month moving
average upgrades vs.
downgrades)
US and Eurozone PMIs
Why it matters
Watch for signs of continued improvement in earnings revisions (aggregated
from stock level). An improved earnings outlook would cause investors to add
more risk, allowing multiples to expand and triggering the outperformance of
value stocks.
If PMIs stabilize or improve, value stocks should outperform as there is no longer
justification to pay the high price for earnings stability (quality). Key dates: 2
July, PMI Manufacturing Eurozone; 2 July, US ISM Manufacturing
Regional differentiation
• Within Europe, look for value
opportunities within each sector, but be
aware of the higher-risk Financials.
• In the US, there are opportunities in value
names that also show strong growth.
• Within Europe, avoid small caps and
instead rotate into large caps.
• In the US, prefer mid caps to large caps
while GDP growth is above 2%.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• We expect value strategies to outperform
the market significantly over the long
term.
• Mid-cap stocks provide attractive
opportunities over the longer term.

Section 2.B
Asset class views
Fixed income
Bonds overview
Government bonds – Key points
• Government bond yields of major developed markets started to rise from their historical lows ahead of
Greek elections, in particular with hopes of more Eurozone integration (e.g. Eurobonds or a European
bank deposit guarantee). The new Greek government has at least eased concerns of an imminent and
disorderly Greek exit helping yields in their short term rise. However, further central bank easing,
including the extension of Operation Twist (OT) until end of 2012 by the Fed limited the further upside
potential in yields over the coming months.
• Our expectations for bond yields over the coming 6 months remain a marginal rise. Despite recent
setbacks in global growth, the world economy remains in expansion mode. However, OT will keep longer
yields low for longer. Also short-term downside risks to bond yields cannot be excluded; Spain has
returned to the spotlight, and challenges in Italy's adjustment programs remain. Given current division
among European leaders, the mutualization of debt is unlikely to be resolved soon.
• On a relative basis, we prefer German and Swiss bonds, over those in the US and UK, where bond yields
could rise faster due to a sounder economic outlook. In particularly in the US, the cyclical recovery looks
comparatively more robust.
• Declining growth momentum, extension of Operation Twist by the Fed and a rising likelihood of a rate
cut by the ECB, are likely to keep yields on extraordinary low levels, for the time being. Thus we suggest a
neutral duration position at this stage.

Corporate and emerging market bonds – Key points
• We maintain our preference for corporate credit (both investment grade and high yield) as well as
emerging market bonds, keeping overweight positions in all three segments.
• Investment grade (IG) corporate bonds showed remarkable resilience in the latest downturn. The asset
class is likely to outperform government bonds in the coming six months, with higher liquidity and lower
volatility than HY bonds. We see the highest return potential in the lower-rated IG segment (BBB and A).
• US corporate bonds of lower credit quality (high yield, HY) remain fundamentally supported by solid
balance sheets and a benign US growth outlook. Given the low risk of default losses, valuations are
attractive at an effective yield of 7.5%. For US HY, we expect high single-digit total returns in the next six
months. US senior loans are an attractive alternative to traditional fixed income assets.
• Emerging market bonds should continue to benefit from better fundamentals than those of developed
markets over the medium term. Valuations remain attractive, and the potential for spreads to trend lower
should more than offset the gradual increase in US Treasury yields in the quarters ahead. We continue to
prefer increasing exposure to corporate bonds while keeping existing investments in sovereign bonds.

US rates Duration preference: neutral
US 10-year (29 June): 1.6% (last month: 1.7%)
UBS View US 10-year (6-month forecast): 1.8%
• US 10-year yields have recovered slightly from their June 1 st 2012 lows after a reduction of political risks
in the Eurozone. However, Treasury yields remain near historical lows due to the extension of Operation
Twist (OT) coupled with recent setbacks of domestic economic data.
• We expect a marginal rise in yields since the US economy remains on a moderate cyclical growth path
with the housing market having bottomed out. Additionally the diminished near-term risk of a Greek exit
from the Eurozone following elections supports a gradual rise in Treasury yields.
• However, over a six-month horizon, the extension of Operation Twist (OT) until the end of 2012 by the
Federal Reserve (Fed) will limit the upside potential in yields. As of late, the probability of even more
stimulus in the form of quantitative easing from the Fed has risen substantially and markets have pushed
out the first rate hike expectation into 2015. Additionally, structural obstacles from the pending US fiscal
consolidation will also limit the upside potential for yields. Further, the US economy seems more vulnerable
to possible spillover effects of increased political uncertainties in the Eurozone.
� Positive scenario for US bonds US 10-year (6-month range): 1.5–1.7%
• The European debt crisis further re-escalates. The resulting contagion would intensify the current flight to
quality, with Italian and Spanish spreads above 550 basis points to the Bund (our base case).
• With the increased likelihood of further quantitative easing, the risk is that yields would stay low or fall
lower.
� Negative scenario for US bonds US 10-year (6-month range): 2.3–2.9%
• If the EU leaders indicate serious commitment towards more fiscal integration, and US growth proves
more sustainable with a rapidly improving labor market, then yields could rise.
• Recently, market expectations regarding future rate hikes by the Fed have pushed out a first rate hike
into 2Q 2015. Any re-pricing into 2014 or 2013 will result in higher yields.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
What we're watching Why it matters
Fed policy The Fed's assessment of the labour market determines it's stance on quantitative
easing and is key for yields. Key dates: 31 July, Federal Open Market
Committee meeting
Labor market
Key focus of the Fed, judged in part based on estimates of the non-accelerating
inflation rate of employment. Key date: 6 July, US non-farm payrolls
Inflation expectations Current yields reflect low real interest rates, but rather normal inflation
expectations. If inflation expectations decline, the risk of a deflationary spiral
would exist, leading to more downside risk for long maturity yields.
US presidential election The US presidential election will guide fiscal spending for the coming years.
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• Declining growth momentum, extension
of Operation Twist by the Fed and a rising
likelihood of a rate cut by the ECB, are
likely to keep yields on extraordinary low
levels, for the time being. Thus we
suggest a neutral duration position
tactically.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• Yields have significant upside potential
over the next couple of years given the
current extraordinarily low levels – of real

European rates Duration preference: neutral
EUR (DE) 10-year (29 June): 1.6% (last month: 1.4%)
UBS View EUR (DE) 10-year (6-month forecast): 1.7%
• We believe the reasons for the recent rise in Bund yields are numerous: First, signs of more Eurozone
integration (e.g. European bank deposit guarantee) combined with the recapitalization of Spanish banks.
Second, the firm commitment of central banks to act if downside risks materialize (possible quantitative
easing by the BoE and a higher probability of a ECB rate cut) and finally, Greek election results met
expectations. However, this rise was muted given the extension of Operation Twist, weak global / German
data and Spain's return to the spotlight.
• Over a three- to six-month horizon, we expect growth momentum to remain subdued but still in positive
territory; we should have more information on how Spain and Italy are handling their adjustment
programs. Also, the new pro-memorandum Greek government should limit safe haven inflows, and thus
limit short-term downside risks to yields.
• In the UK, economic data continues to be mixed as the recovery continues but is prone to external shocks.
The recent liquidity provision announcement by the BoE has confirmed these concerns.
• In Switzerland, yields have traded range bound owing to conflicting economic data. The SNB stressed
increased downside risks to the economy and stands ready to act. However, we believe Swiss yields will
gradually normalize.
� Positive scenario for German bonds 10-year Bund yield (6-month range) 1.1–1.3%
• The European debt crisis re-escalates. The resulting contagion would intensify the current flight to
quality.
• The economic recovery fails to gain momentum in the second half of the year. Credit demand fails to
improve further as some of the recent European Central Bank (ECB) data indicates. The ECB cuts rates.
• Further quantitative easing by the Fed would be supportive for Bunds and speaks for lower yields.
� Negative scenario for German bonds 10-year Bund yield (6-month range) 1.9–2.3%
• A moderate Eurozone economic recovery kicks in, supporting debt-burdened Eurozone countries in their
efforts to fulfill austerity commitments and thus reducing the demand for safe-haven assets. Alternatively,
Germany gives additional guarantees and the Eurozone moves towards a transfer union.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
What we're watching
Elections/EU fiscal
consolidation
Central banks
Economic variables
Eurozone yield spreads
Why it matters
The EU Summit will show if newly elected governments will change the dynamics
in the Eurozone.
The revival of the SMP program by the ECB would reduce the yields in the
periphery. Their assessments of the current economic situation can give hints of
further rate cuts or quantitative easing measures. Key dates: 5 July, ECB rate
decision; 31 July, Fed FOMC meeting
Credit conditions (ECB bank lending survey). Key date: 14 August, Eurozone
GDP Q2
The level of yield spreads to German bonds influences the level of German Bund
yields due to safe-haven flows.
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• Long term Bund yields would fall lower,
in case of rising Euro zone break up
probability. In contrast if Germany would
need to support the periphery further,
Bund yields would rise. We expect the
market to oscillate between these two
cases and recommend to stay neutral on
duration tactically.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• Yields have significant upside potential
over the next couple of years. Thus clients
with a long time horizon should focus on

Investment grade corporate bonds Preference: overweight
Current global spread (26 June): 225bps (last month: 225bps)
UBS View Spread target (6-month): 170bps
• We expect investment grade (IG) corporate bonds to achieve a total return of around 3% over the next
six months. Our spread target of 170bps is based on our benign economic outlook, ongoing investor
appetite for income-generating assets and expected negative net issuance. This target spread is still above
its 15-year average of 130bps.
• Non-financial corporates: While total yields are at record lows, the pickup over government bonds and
money market rates is attractive. Aggressive re-leveraging by companies looks unlikely in the current
environment. Credit quality should remain good and non-financials continue to deliver a stable income.
• Financial corporates: Due to regulatory challenges, spreads are expected to remain above past averages.
Total returns could outpace non-financials, but volatility will be considerably higher.
• Overall, IG corporate bonds remain a preferred asset class, providing an attractive yield pickup. The asset
class offers relatively low volatility and a benign total return outlook. We expect lower-rated issuers (BBB
and A) to outperform higher-rated ones.
� Positive scenario Spread target (6-month): 140bps
• Global growth accelerates more forcefully than expected. This could compress spreads to closer to precrisis
levels. Spreads for Financials are likely to remain elevated due to regulatory challenges. However, in
this positive case, rising benchmark yields would limit total returns to 1–2% over six months.
� Negative scenario Spread target (6-month): 400bps
• Even if US economic growth falters, and the European recession turns out to be worse than currently
expected, we believe we would be unlikely to see the spread levels reached in 2009, given companies’
superior balance sheet positions. European financial issuers would be most at risk in this scenario.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
What we're watching
Why it matters
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• We still see room for tighter yield spreads;
the return outlook compares very

• Internationally diversified companies from

conservative investors.
• We recommend bonds from the lower IG
rating segments (BBB and A) over higherrated
issuers.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)

High yield corporate bonds Preference: overweight
UBS View
Spread USD HY (26 June): 660bps (last month: 660bps)
USD HY spread target (6-month): 525bps
• US high yield (HY) bonds continue to offer attractive value; we expect high single-digit total returns over
the next six months. We stick to our spread forecast of 525bps based on an ongoing recovery of the US
economy, robust company balance sheets, rising earnings, and ongoing investor appetite for higheryielding
assets. US HY bonds remain our preferred asset class.
• Fundamental factors remain supportive. Despite the recent uptick in defaults, in the absence of a
renewed US recession only a very gradual increase is to be expected. We forecast a modest rise in the
trailing default rate to 3.5% at the end of the year from 3.1% in May. A heavy load of new issuance in the
first three months of the year means that HY companies will be faced with a lower risk of failed
refinancing going forward (e.g. in case of an unexpected economic slump).
• We acknowledge that ongoing risk aversion could still cause spreads to widen somewhat in the short run.
Investors who are able and willing to hold on to their HY position will likely benefit over 6 months.
� Positive scenario USD HY spread target (6-month): 450bps
• In the positive economic scenario, a rally in high yield bonds and a return to pre-crisis spreads of about
400bps is likely. Benchmark yields would also rise, limiting HY returns to around 10%. European HY
outperforms the US.
� Negative scenario USD HY spread target (6-month): 1,200bps
• A global recession is a major risk for high yield bonds. Based on the more robust state of the corporate
sector, we would not expect spreads to widen to 2008/09 peak levels above 2,000bps. Although short-term
spikes are likely, due to liquidity suddenly drying up, we would expect a quick return to the usual
recession-level spread of around 1,200bps.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
What we're watching
Credit quality/
default cycle
New issuance
Bank lending standards
Why it matters
As long as corporate earnings increase and balance sheets remain backed by high
cash levels and low debt ratios, the default rate will remain below its 5% longterm
average.
For now, favorable conditions in the primary market have mainly been used for
refinancing. More aggressive issuance activities should be monitored.
Bank lending provides an important source of funding. US banks relaxed
standards slightly in 2Q. Key dates: early-July, ECB bank lending survey;
late-July, Fed Senior Loan Officer Survey
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• US high yield corporate bonds offer an
attractive return outlook and should be
overweighted.
• We prefer US over European issuers given
the poorer economic outlook in Europe
and the increasing proportion of
peripheral and financial issuers in the
European HY universe.
• Inflows into HY mutual funds have been
strong so far in 2012, but new issuance has
cooled down a bit in April and May.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• We expect US defaults to remain at belowaverage
levels for longer. Significant releveraging
is unlikely in the medium term.
• We believe US high yield corporate bonds
will provide good returns for absolute
return-oriented investors, as well as
relative to other fixed income segments.

Emerging market bonds Preference: overweight
EMBI Global / CEMBI spread (27 June): 388bps / 430bps (last month: 410bps / 440bps)
UBS View EMBI Global / CEMBI spread target (6-month): 340bps / 350bps
• Emerging market (EM) bond spreads are currently higher than implied by fundamentals, and we think
they offer attractive returns even against a more challenging global backdrop.
• The probability remains significant, though, that negative headlines out of the Eurozone or a weakening
global growth outlook will put short-term pressure on EM bond prices. However, given EM sovereigns'
better average fundamentals, and EM corporates' solid profit growth outlook and low leverage ratios, we
think that periods of price weakness should offer attractive entry points.
• Although we revised our spread targets (to 340bps from 300bps for sovereigns, and to 350bps from
310bps for corporates), we continue to expect spreads to trend gradually lower over the next six months,
more than offsetting the moderate rise in US Treasury yields we expect in the quarters ahead.
� Positive scenario EMBI Global / CEMBI spread target (6-month): 290bps / 290bps
• Yield stability in Europe's core markets and higher-than-expected growth in the US would provide a
favorable backdrop for EM fixed income spreads. In such an environment, issuers of lower credit quality
would likely fare better. Average spreads could tighten to below 300bps in such an environment.
� Negative scenario EMBI Global / CEMBI spread target (6-month): 525bps / 700bps
• An environment of escalating risk aversion in Europe, deteriorating EM funding markets, weakening
global growth prospects, and lower commodity prices could impact EM credit negatively. Liquidity in
emerging market bonds could dry up and spreads could spike.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
What we're watching Why it matters
Core market yields The direction of US Treasury and German Bund yields are important for EM fixed
income spreads, especially for USD- and EUR-denominated bonds.
Key dates: 1 August, US ISM & FOMC rate decision
Capital flows The European debt crisis may lead to further periods of outflows and weaker
prices, which could offer attractive entry levels for investors.
Monetary policy cycles Monetary policy easing remains a key topic for local currency bonds. We look for
central bank policy announcements in key markets such as Brazil, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, and Turkey. Key policy rate
announcement dates: 29 June, Colombia; 4 July, Poland; 5 July,
Malaysia; 11 July, Brazil; 12 July, Indonesia; 19 July, Turkey
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• EM corporate bonds are particularly
attractive due to favorable valuation,
solid fundamentals, and their relatively
short duration. We advise clients to focus
on investment grade bonds in the current
environment. We continue to like
selected sovereign bonds.
• Please refer to our EM bond list for
specific guidance.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• EM bonds are attractive for longer-term
investors looking for higher yields.
• Local markets in Asia offer interesting
opportunities for longer-term investors
because of a supportive currency outlook.

Foreign exchange
Foreign exchange overview
Foreign exchange – Key points
• EUR: Greek election results reduce the near-term euro break-up risk. Now starts a difficult period with
re-negotiation of the Greek austerity program. Also Spanish yields, which have reached hard to sustain
highs, need to be addressed. As the crisis carries on and hurts growth prospects for Europe well into 2013
we recommend to keep euro short positions. The risk for either an ECB rate cut or an extension of bond
purchase program by ECB as well as the increasing risks to the banking system are weighing on the euro.
• The extension of Operation Twist in response to weakening growth outlook in the US has its pros and
cons for the USD. Global risk aversion and search for alternatives to the euro is supporting the greenback
currently. The clear commitment of the Fed to respond with more stimulus to European contagion and
the approaching fiscal cliff is limiting the upside potential for the USD.
• The CAD has increased in attractiveness recently due to weaker spot rates, while good growth dynamics
in Canada still lead to rate hike expectations. We continue to recommend an overweight.
• We keep the overweight position in the GBP. The BoE eased monetary conditions for the banking
system to protect the UK financial market against contagion effects spilling over from the continent.
Apart from this, we think the pound remains well supported, because valuation is cheap and investors are
seeking liquid alternatives to the euro.
• EURCHF is currently trading at the low end of our expected range of 1.20–1.25, and we therefore keep
an underweight position in the CHF. The 1.20 EURCHF floor prevents any CHF appreciation and the SNB
has clearly shown in May that it is willing and can protect the floor; we expect the SNB to continue in this.
• Sweden and Norway stand out for their lower debt-to-GDP ratios and current account surpluses. The
NOK appreciated recently, due to safe haven inflows. We stay neutral as the appreciation potential is now
limited. The SEK is very sentiment-driven and should profit in the medium term.
• Longer-term debt issues and weak competitiveness of major exporters are hurting the Japanese
economy. Therefore the Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance will maintain an expansive policy and
continue to try weaken the JPY. However, current positive growth dynamics are supportive of the JPY.
• For commodity currencies, the AUD and NZD weakened within ranges from March to May. We expect
another bout of weakness over the next three months together with increasing European troubles.
• We expect the CNY to appreciate 3% against the USD, moving towards 6.15 over the coming 12 months.
Internationally marketable instruments (such as CNH, the offshore version of the Chinese currency traded
in Hong Kong) have similar appreciation potential. Our most preferred emerging market currencies are
currently MXN, ZAR, PLN, ZAR, KRW and CNY.

G10 currencies
UBS View see UBS FX forecasts, below-right
• The negative momentum on the EUR is likely to persist. The growth outlook has deteriorated in the last
couple of months to a point, which challenges the fiscal austerity efforts seriously.
• The USD profits from European troubles, but the upside remains limited by expansive fed policy
• The GBP is resuming its uptrend despite stimulus measures by the Bank of England. The main reason is
the need for diversification of the EUR and better current economic indicators.
•The AUD seems to have found a bottom, and should recover on the back of better risk sentiment. We
believe the CAD remains one of the most attractive currencies.
• The SNB has shown that it will defend the CHF-floor. EURCHF will remain in the 1.20-1.25 range.
� Positive scenario FX targets: EURUSD >1.35 / EURJPY 120
• Eurozone economies avoid a material contraction and financial market conditions recover. EURUSD
should trade above 1.40 in this case. Yen weakness could develop, since hopes for global growth would
make the carry-trade role of the yen more prominent.
� Negative scenario FX targets: EURUSD <1.20 / EURJPY 100
• European growth outlook deteriorates further with continued recession in 2013. The euro could rapidly
fall below 1.20. A European debt default cascade is a tail risk for the single currency. Risk aversion would
lead to an extended USD and JPY rally.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
Recommendations

• Long USD, GBP and CAD

should only be added at better entry

EM currencies
UBS View For current exchange rates and CIO forecasts see table
• With the risk of a Greek Eurozone exit subsiding, we think selected emerging market (EM) currencies
look attractive over the medium term against the USD and JPY and some even against the EUR.
• Global growth prospects remain intact, also due to recent policy easing in China, and the risk of a
broader European crisis remains contained, in our view. Over the medium term, this will likely support EM
currencies. However, further bouts of volatility remain likely in the months ahead, since negative headlines
from Europe will likely continue to weigh on investor sentiment.
• Our tactical and strategic recommendations list our preferred currencies. For now, we remain cautious on
the Brazilian real, Hungarian forint, Indian rupee, and Turkish lira.
� Positive scenario > 7% outperformance of EM FX against G4 currencies over a 6-month horizon
• Macroeconomic data comes in stronger than expected and contagion risks in Europe subside further. EM
exchange rates could appreciate swiftly against G4 currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP).
� Negative scenario > 4% depreciation of EM FX across regions against USD over a 6-month horizon
• Global growth prospects suffer a prolonged deterioration and the European debt crisis intensifies
further. EM exchange rates could see a significant, although likely temporary, sell-off across regions.
Should growth concerns return to the fore, we expect export-oriented EM countries (e.g. most Asian
economies) to welcome currency weakness in order to cushion economic growth.

Setbacks in sentiment will likely lead to bouts of EM currency depreciation and

NTAC: Commodities, Listed real estate, Hedge funds and
Private equity
Commodities overview
Commodities – Key points
• Broadly diversified commodity indices, which declined by about 10% in May, found some support in
June. The sideways move was visible across all commodity sectors, with gold (precious metals)
delivering a temporary price uptick after the May US nonfarm payroll release.
• Despite signs of price stabilization, diversified commodity indices are likely to decline in the
coming weeks. Sluggish economic activity should put upward pressure on most commodity
inventories. To mitigate inventory buildups, lower prices are required, in our view. Production cuts for
cyclical commodities need to be incentivized, while demand needs a push.
• The starting point for gold (precious metals) remains challenging, with supply likely to outpace
demand this year. However, the chance of further monetary easing (QE3) by the Fed - which is not our
base case - is an upside risk to the gold price. Given the weak fundamental situation combined with
the substantial QE3 risk we maintain our neutral position.
• Easing geopolitical tensions related to Iran and further inventory builds in crude oil shifted the
market's attention to sluggish demand growth. With muted incremental crude oil consumption, crude
oil prices are likely to remain under pressure. But as production cuts are likely to kick in, downward
price momentum should slow meaningfully. OPEC production cuts of up to 0.5 mbpd are needed in
the coming months, and should allow the Brent price to stabilize in the USD 80.5 - 90/bbl range (WTI
with a USD 12/bbl discount). But a sideways move in crude oil is not good enough to be long the
commodity. The Brent forward curve has joined WTI and moved into contango as well. Hence, we
keep our underweight position.
• With regards to base metals, prices have room to soften in the very short run (4-6 weeks). Copper
prices are likely to decline to USD 6,600/mt in order to weigh on scrap supply and compensate for
deteriorating Chinese import volumes. But the price decline in copper and other base metals should be
short lived. Fiscal and monetary easing in China provide the basis for an acceleration in base metal
demand and should keep prices largely flat on a 6-month horizon. Moreover, metals like aluminum
and nickel are already trading deeply into the production cost curve, which we regard as
unsustainable over the long run. We keep a neutral position on base metals until we see further
confirmation of a pickup in Chinese economic activity.
• The outlook for ample supply in agricultural commodities, especially for corn, should still weigh on
the grain complex towards the end of the year. Some short-term price support from dry US Midwest
weather conditions in recent weeks is not altering our negative stance. Soft commodities are also
battling with higher inventories, which will not bode well for prices in 3Q 2012.

Precious metals Preference: neutral
Gold (25 Jun): USD 1,573/oz (last month: USD 1,573/oz)
UBS View (gold)
6-month target: USD 1,650/oz
• The price outlook for gold is largely tied to quantitative easing by the Fed. Although the probability has
increased on weak US data, our base case still calls for no QE. Hence, current prices run on thin ice, in our
view. In the absence of any monetary stimulus, the gold market is likely to be oversupplied by more than
400 tons this year.
• Physical demand out of Asia remains lackluster. With the USDINR trading at a record high, the world's
second-largest gold market, India, is likely to witness a steep decline in jewelry consumption and a rather
firm increase in scrap supply. Central bank buying, estimated at 300 tons (7% of total demand) in 2012,
will not be enough to clear the market. Right incentives – i.e. temporary price setbacks – are needed to
motivate enough demand, before prices should manage to rebound towards USD 1,650/oz in 6 months.
• The negative stance from a absolute return perspective, should not overshadow the relative
attractiveness of the yellow metal. The higher probability of QE3 by the Fed poses an upside risk to the
gold price. Hence, we maintain our neutral position.
� Positive scenario 6-month target: USD 1,920/oz
• Additional quantitative easing measures by the US Fed and the ECB are implemented, or inflation
accelerates sharply in emerging markets. This would drive the gold price towards USD 1,920/oz again.
� Negative scenario 6-month target: USD 1,250/oz
• A liquidity crisis would curtail financial demand and weigh on the gold price. A similar impact would
come from deflationary pressure (positive real rates), or a combined Chinese and Indian hard landing.
Recommendations
Tactical (up to 6 months)
• In case of a conversion into gold, investors
should hold the position and target reconversion
at the original strike level. Over
three months, we regard strike levels
around USD 1,460–1,520/oz as attractive.
With option volatility on the rise, the risk
reward for selling volatility has improved.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• The risks for debt monetization in the
developed world and double-digit wage
growth in China and India, the two largest
gold markets, should ensure a steady rise
in demand for gold and platinum over
time. Physically backed ETF positions allow
investors to participate effectively in
higher prices. Positive real interest rates
present a threat to this view.
Gold in INR terms and Indian gold
demand
What we're watching
Physical demand/supply
Flows & rates
Why it matters
Further INR weakness in the coming months should determine jewelry demand
from India. The health of coin and bar demand should be visible in the World
Gold Council mid-August release. After the drop in PGM production,
keeping an eye on South African PGM output is a must.
To judge gold-related financing deals, we track gold export/import between
Hong Kong and China. In addition we follow the latest uptick in ETF gold
holdings and futures positions in gold to proxy investment demand strength.
From an opportunity-cost perspective (real interest rate standpoint), we also
look at the upcoming meetings of the ECB on 5 July and Fed on 1 August.

Energy
Brent (25 Jun): USD 91/bbl (last month: USD 109/bbl)
UBS View (crude oil) Brent 6-month target: USD 100/bbl
• A combination of renewed economic concerns about the Eurozone, easing geopolitical tensions between
Iran and the West, and further inventory builds in crude oil triggered a sharp decline in the Brent crude oil
price to USD 92/bbl and USD80/bbl for WTI.
• We think the crude oil market is oversupplied, which is likely to push up OECD crude oil inventories to 62
days of consumption in the coming months. While it seems that Saudi Arabia has slightly reduced its
production in May from 10.1 mbpd in April, the country could be in a wait-and-see position for longer.
First, the EU/US sanctions on Iran take effect at the end of June/early July, and bring some additional supply
uncertainty. Second, Saudi Arabia also sees the need for lower prices in the short run to support economic
activity in the developed world. But to prevent inventories from swelling too strongly, additional
production cuts of up to 0.5 mbpd (0.55% of global demand) are needed in the coming months.
• So what should investors do at current levels? Although downward momentum in crude oil prices is likely
to fade, a sideways move should still lead to negative investment returns in the short run. The Brent
forward curve flipped into contango from backwardation, which is deteriorating the risk reward payoff of
the energy sector. Hence, we currently maintain our underweight position.
� Positive scenario
Brent 6-month target: USD 140-180/bbl
• Iranian oil exports gets subject to a complete embargo, or military interventions affect crude oil supply
via the Strait of Hormuz. Alternative OPEC supply routs would not be in a position to compensate for such
a supply shortfall. In order to curb demand, prices would need to spike towards USD 180/bbl.
� Negative scenario Brent 6-month target: USD 75-80/bbl
• Economic growth in the developed world contracts, thereby triggering a 0.5% to 1% decline in world
crude oil consumption. Although to a lesser degree, fading Iranian tensions and no supply cuts by OPEC
would allow crude oil inventories to build firmly and push Brent prices down towards USD 80/bbl.
What we're watching Why it matters
Iran tensions Resurfacing Iranian tensions could cause prices to spike higher, but an escalation is
less likely, in our view. The focus is on remaining Iranian exports (currently around
1.6mbpd versus 2.4 mbpd in 2011).
Supply US crude oil supply has come in strongly – reaching 6.4 mbpd. Further supply
growth would not bode well for WTI crude oil. We also look at oil supply related to
Sudan, Syria and Yemen, which caused a 0.5 mbpd decline in global crude oil
production capacity. It seems that these production capabilities will remain offline
for a longer period – potentially until 2014.
Oil market reports Key dates: 12 July, IEA Medium Term Oil market report. Another round of
(EIA/IEA/OPEC) downward revisions to demand, like in June, is not expected. The latest forecast
changes to demand have been meaningful.

Preference: underweight
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• We foresee further short-term weakness
although less pronounced than the past
month – we expect Brent to stabilize in
the range of USD 80.5 - 90/bbl in the next
3 months. Production cuts and a pick up in
emerging market demand should push
Brent crude oil above current levels.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• After the demand slump in 1H 2012, we
expect Brent crude oil to trade at USD
110/bbl in 12 months. This higher price
level for 2013 reflects our expectation that
economic activity should provide price
support in 2013. Thus, three-year crude oil
futures contracts at USD 90/bbl remain for
us mispriced and an attractive investment
solution for strategy-oriented crude oil
investors.

UBS View 6-month target: copper: UDS 7,400/mt nickel: USD 18,000/mt; aluminum: USD 2,200/mt
• With the exception of aluminum, base metal prices stabilized broadly in June. But we see room for
somewhat lower prices in the short run (4-6 weeks). Deteriorating industrial activity in Asian countries,
weak US data and the Euro-zone crisis remain a price burden for the sector in the early part of 3Q12.
• To weigh on scrap supply and compensated for lower Chinese copper imports, copper prices are likely to
decline towards USD 6600/mt, in our view. For the rest of the base metals, prices could move deeper into
the cost curve of production. When it comes to aluminum and nickel, however, prices have already
declined deeply into the production cost curve. In both cases supply cuts could come quicker and limit the
price downside from current levels.
• In addition, supply uncertainty related to aluminum and nickel needs to be considered as well.
Indonesia's new regulations on ore exports could jack up Chinese import costs by around 20% in the
coming quarters. We think such an increase would be meaningfully, as 60% of China's nickel pig iron (NPI)
production and 80% of China's bauxite imports depend on Indonesia.
• The reason why base metals overall should trade at current levels or higher in six months from now,
relates to China. We think the People's Bank of China has made the right monetary policy steps to achieve
stronger credit activity and higher sequential GDP growth in 2H 2012. With this fairly balanced risk reward
on a six-month horizon, we maintain our neutral position.
� Positive scenario
• China eases monetary policy aggressively, by pushing credit growth beyond 20% y/y. Additional QE in
the US paired with stable European and Japanese demand would allow the sector to rally by around 25%.
� Negative scenario
• Chinese monetary conditions remain behind the curve, resulting in an economic hard landing. A severe
escalation of the Eurozone crisis (deep recession/global impact) could also bring prices close to 2009 levels.
What we're watching Why it matters
Demand The latest uptick in Chinese imports, driven by technical factors, do not
reflect stronger end demand. The June figures (on 10 July) should give some
clarity. That said, the attractiveness to import from an arbitrage perspective
SHFE to LME has improved. Interest for physically backed copper ETFs needs to
be tracked as exchange inventories are structurally low.
Supply
Copper supply has room to improve in 2H 2012 from poor mine output in 1H
2012. Fading supply disruptions and capacity additions put copper at risk.
Indonesia's new export rules could have a positive one-off impact on aluminum
and nickel.
Economic data/forward
curve
People's Bank of China meeting, Chinese economic data (especially IP and loan
growth by financial institutions) Key dates: 11–15 July
Recommendations
Tactical (3-6 months)
• From a timing perspective, building up
exposure to base metals is not yet
advised. While we still expect higher
prices over the next 6–12 months, the
short-term downside risks should offer
investors better entry points, particularly
for copper. That said, existing aluminum
and nickel positions should be kept.
Strategic (>1 year )
• Rising energy and labor costs provide the
backdrop for base metal prices to trend
higher. The strongest performance is
likely to come from zinc and lead, where
existing mine capacity is expected to peak
in 2014. Environmentally challenged base
metals, like tin, should be in line with the
sector average. For nickel and aluminum,
ample production capacity should lead to
an underperformance in the long run.
Due to its high current price versus
production costs, copper should lag too.

Preference: underweight
Current (25 June) (last month): Soybeans, USD 14.79/bu (USD13.82/bu); Corn, USD 6.09/bu(USD 5.79/bu);
Wheat, USD 6.91/bu (USD 6.80/bu)
UBS View 6-month target: Soybeans, USD 13.5/bu; Corn, USD 5.10/bu; Wheat, USD 6.00/bu
• Besides the overall commodity price backdrop, prevailing dry weather conditions in the US have been
price supportive for the grains and added to firmer prices.
• While weather-related news flows might support grain prices in the short run (downward revisions in
grain yield estimates, especially corn), the 6–12 month price outlook remains negative. Global corn
inventories should grow beyond 10% in 2012/13. We think this will more than compensate for firmer
wheat fundaments (lower inventory estimates) in the coming months. For soybeans, current price levels
sufficiently factor in the poor supply figures seen in recent months. This would be especially true, if South
American planting gets a boost due to soybeans' relative price improvement.
• A strong supply backdrop for Brazilian coffee along with a weaker BRL has kept coffee prices under
pressure. For 2012/13, Brazilian coffee and sugar exports are likely to increase by 12% and 2% y/y
respectively, and keep the global market well supplied in 2012. Cotton prices saw some bouts of strength,
but demand has yet to work off high inventory levels at 74–75mn bales. With ample inventories and
economic conditions at risk, renewed price weakness is likely.
� Positive scenario
Soybeans 6-month USD 16/bu
• Lower acreage and yield figures for the US can tighten the supply backdrop until 1Q 2013 (until the new
South American crop comes). On the demand side, higher soybean use for bio diesel in Argentina and
strong Chinese imports (improvements in crush margins) are catalysts for prices to rally.
� Negative scenario
Soybeans 6-month USD 12/bu
• Unexpected Chinese government stock sale of soybeans and deteriorating crushing margins for soybean
oil/meal production, would leave soybean prices vulnerable to a price correction.
What we're watching
USDA WASDE report
(monthly)
Grains stock report
(quarterly)
USDA crop progress
(weekly, Monday)
COT (weekly, Friday)
Why it matters
US corn yields could be at risk in the upcoming WASDE release. Key date : 11
July 2012
Corn and soybean inventories could be lowered vs. current estimates, reflecting
the strong export activity in corn during March–May and higher soybean crushing
during the same period. Key date: 28 September 2012
Dry weather conditions in the US has impacted the crop conditions (rating),
which deteriorated in recent weeks.
Investors have scaled back their long exposure in corn. At the present speed, net
positions would close in on zero over the next two months.
Recommendations
Tactical
• The forward curve in corn already factors
in a steep decline by the end of the year,
thereby mitigating the expected negative
return. With lower corn prices, wheat
should come under pressure as well. Most
agricultural commodities are generally
well supplied, so unless the weather
surprises on the downside, we expect
further weakness.
Strategic
• Strategic agricultural positions are not
recommended at present. Our return
outlook for the grains stands at –7.5% to
– 5% over the next 12 months. Although
the softs have a positive return outlook
over the same period, investors should
bide their time. Short-term price setbacks
of 10% or more are still likely over the
next two to three months.

Listed real estate Preference: neutral
UBS Global Index DTR (28 June): 1,375 (last month: 1,320)
UBS View UBS Global Index DTR (6-month target): 1,400
• A slight positive monthly performance has been driven by rebounds in the higher beta markets,
respectively Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.
• Listed real estate is still attractively valued on different earnings ratios and trade on a slight discount to
NAV. Earnings yields over 5 year swap rate are attractive currently attractive, yet the flattening of interest
curves has come to a halt and we see less support from it in the future.
• Little supply of commercial space across the globe leads vacancy rates to gradually decline and low
capitalization rates in core markets support capital values. Also rental yields remain attractive compared to
high grade bond yields. However, further significant capital appreciation is unlikely. This is especially due a
slow down in rental income as economic growth is subdued. Hence, future performance is limited.
• Although slightly reduced, we maintain our preference for US REITs due to stable fundamentals and like
Australia as a conservative play. We slightly overweight Hong Kong, stay neutral towards Singapore, but
maintain a slight underweight in Japan as fundamentals remain unconvincing.
� Positive scenario UBS Global Index DTR (6-month target): 1,500
• Improving macroeconomic data in the US, positive economic surprises in Europe followed by monetary
easing in China help to increase growth prospects that support rental income growth, while refinancing
costs remain low in a low inflation environment. Real estate offers a comparatively attractive yield.
� Negative scenario UBS Global Index DTR (6-month target): 1,300
• The US growth path disappoints investor expectations and causes the comparatively high valuation levels
there to correct, significantly affecting global real estate. Furthermore, a more severe recession in Europe
triggers a tightening of credit standards, making listed real estate more dependent than ever on bank
financing at a time when credit markets are already fragile. Real estate underperforms global equities
because the correlation between the availability of credit and short-term performance is high.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
What we're watching
Capitalization rates and
rental yields
Transaction volumes and
future rental growth in
direct markets
Credit markets and
financing costs
Why it matters
We do not expect capitalization rates to decrease much from now. Rental yields
have already been pushed down by decreasing bond yields; we see a diminishing
support from the interest curve, which has significantly flattened in the past.
Global commercial real estate transaction volumes are down year-on-year due to
a lack of product in core markets and constraints on debt financing. Global rental
growth has softened and very modest growth will feature major markets overall.
Lending conditions have been a little tightened. However, well financed listed
companies have still good access to credit, while others are more restricted.
Recommendations
Tactical (6 months)
• We maintain our neutral stance towards
listed real estate after a good performance
year-to-date and due to a relative less
attractive valuation compared to global
equities. Going forward returns are limited
by subdued revenue growth. However, we
still expect listed real estate to stay
comparatively attractive in a low growth,
low rates environment.
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• A cyclical slowdown in rents limits growth,
but attractive refinancing conditions are
supportive. We see potential for higher
payout ratios in the US and Asia, while
Europe has to consolidate balance sheets.

Hedge funds
UBS View
Prefer Relative value and Event-driven
• We expect hedge funds (HF) to offer positive asymmetric returns characteristics vs. the S&P 500 due to
active management and stop-loss strategies. (HF were down 1.9% in May 2012 vs MSCI world at –8.5%)
• Decelerating global growth prospects, the next leg in the ongoing Eurozone crisis, is challenging mostly
equity long-short managers, who are net-long the market. While event-driven managers share some of
the performance drivers, idiosyncratic bets (event) reduce the exposure to markets. The real reason to own
this strategy, however, is the potential for out-sized return in distressed, high yield and other credit
investments as the Eurozone crisis plays out. The inherent hedging in relative-value should remain
appealing. Credit relative-value managers should perform well in this environment of higher fixed income
volatility and increasing pricing anomalies created by central bank interventions (OT2) and limited
competition.
� Positive scenario
Prefer Equity long-short
• A reduction of uncertainty (e.g. resolution in Europe) lowers equities' correlation and volatility. This
helps bottom-up fundamental analysis and equity long/short managers the most. Also, CEOs will likely
make more corporate transactions that can be monetized by event-driven managers, and a clearer
macroeconomic environment with more persistent trends would be supportive for macro managers
� Negative scenario Prefer Trading (Global Macro + CTA)
• A 2011-type scenario in which hedge fund managers get whipsawed through the year with risk-on and
risk-off circumstances, driven by a multitude of political interventions, is difficult to anticipate. That would
impact long-short managers, event-driven, and to a lesser extent global macro managers.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
What we're watching Why it matters
Global equity direction
/ economic cycle
The outlook for global equities becomes an important HF performance driver.
The economic cycle impacts the strategies differently.
Correlation
Correlation among pair-stocks; an important performance/alpha driver for
equity long/short, the largest HF strategy by assets under management.
Leverage
Gross and net leverage are key to monitoring risk.
Volatility The direction influences certain HF strategies (e.g. convertible arbitrage).
Liquidity Particularly for large HF that are less nimble to enter and exit their strategies
Regulation
Volcker's rule, USCITS III/IV
Recommendations
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• Active risk management is instrumental for
capital preservation during adverse market
conditions. At the moment, we therefore
favor relative value and event-driven
strategies, since they are less hinged to
equity markets and other risky assets than
trading is.
• Value proposition: Hedge funds should
achieve robust performance over an
extended horizon, while displaying limited
volatility vis-à-vis equities and other risky
assets, in general. Hedge funds minimize
downside losses in adverse market
conditions (e.g. active risk management)
and play a crucial role in wealth
appreciation, since there is less ground to
regain in the recovery phase and
ultimately greater chances for superior
long-term returns.

Private Equity
Prefer small/mid-cap buyout in US / emerging markets;
UBS View distressed debt in Europe
• Private equity deals in today's volatile and uncertain markets are conservatively financed, with an average
equity cushion of 40%. We like mid-market buyout strategies, which offer long-term exposure to attractive
corporate assets and which rely less on large bank debt syndications.
• Our house view sees large parts of Europe in a stagnation, and business owners are reluctant to sell their
companies, reducing PE deal flow in the region significantly. We therefore prefer North America, which
will see continuous (albeit suboptimal) growth, and emerging markets, which show positive fundamentals.
• Prices for PE transactions have corrected by around 10% this year, although they are still 20% above the
attractive levels seen during the successful years between 2000 and 2004. However, significant dry powder
and high cash positions at corporations keep competition high and hinder prices from falling much further.
� Positive scenario
Prefer small-/mid-cap buyout and secondaries
• An abating Eurozone debt crisis and improved business confidence would increase deal flow and exit
opportunities for private equity managers, but would also increase entry prices. In such a positive scenario,
we would perceive commitment strategies to secondary funds as attractive for building exposure to an
invested private equity portfolio.
� Negative scenario Prefer distressed debt
• A renewed escalation of the debt crisis would significantly impact deal activity, the availability of debt
and company owners' willingness to sell. At the same time, it would offer attractive opportunities within
distressed strategies and lower entry prices for long-term private equity investors.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)
What we're watching
Credit markets
Capital overhang
Purchasing prices (Enterprise
value / EDITDA)
Why it matters
Availability of leverage and credit spreads are important signs of the health of
buyout markets. Small/mid caps are currently financed at 4.3x EBITDA (vs 4.6x
for large-caps) and are more attractive given their lower reliance on bank
financing in a period of ongoing bank deleveraging.
We track deal/exit activity to understand the pressure to invest, future price
dynamics and draw-down profiles for investors. More than USD 930bn of uninvested
capital and expiring investment periods will keep prices elevated.
Price multiples offer valuable insight into private company valuations. YTD
May 2012, buyouts occurred at 8.1x, down from 8.8x seen in 2011. Large-cap
buyouts have come down 10% from the peak last year to 8.6x.
USD bn
Recommendations
Strategic (1 to 2 years)
• We prefer small-/mid-cap buyouts in North
America given the better economic
outlook vs Europe, higher transaction
certainty and more attractive entry prices.
• Investors looking for downside protection
and stability during economic
uncertainties can consider large-cap
buyouts in the US, which offer exposure
to large, diversified companies at more
attractive prices.
• In Europe, the crisis and ongoing
deleveraging have led to attractive
opportunities for special situations. We
thus recommend investing in distressed
debt to benefit from the macroeconomic
adjustment process and selling pressure
for many European banks.
• We advise investors make an ongoing
allocation to private equity in emerging
markets, which offer an attractive way to
capture superior long-term growth and
provide access to small/mid-cap companies
not available through the stock market.
Private equity deals continue to be defensively
financed amidst economic uncertainty

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (emphasis
added). The Board understands the
“economic impact of * * * the rule’ to
refer to the costs to affected entities of
complying with the rule, not to the
economic impact of a series of
subsequent decisions made by
individual actors in the economy that
are neither compelled by, nor the
inevitable result of, the rule.197 Even if
more employees opt for union
representation after learning about their
rights, employers can avoid the adverse
effects on business costs, flexibility, and
profitability predicted by Baker &
Daniels LLP and other commenters by
not agreeing to unions’ demands that
might produce those effects.198

The Board finds support for this view
in the language of Section 603 of the
RFA, which lists the items to be
included in an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis if one is required. 5
U.S.C. 603. Section 603(a) states only
that such analysis ‘‘shall describe the
impact of the proposed rule on small
entities.” 5 U.S.C. 603(a). However,
Section 603(b) provides, as relevant
here, that “[e]ach initial regulatory
flexibility analysis * * * shall
contain—* * *

“(4) a description of the projected
reporting, recordkeeping and other
compliance requirements of the
proposed rule, including an estimate of
the classes of small entities which will
be subject to the requirement and the
type of professional skills necessary for
preparation of the report or record|[.]”’ 5
U.S.C. 603(b)(4) (emphasis added). The
Small Business Administration cites, as
examples of “other compliance
requirements,”

(a) Capital costs for equipment needed to
meet the regulatory requirements; (b) costs of
modifying existing processes and procedures
to comply with the proposed rule; (c) lost
sales and profits resulting from the proposed
rule; (d) changes in market competition as a
result of the proposed rule and its impact on
small entities or specific submarkets of small
entities; (e) extra costs associated with the
payment of taxes or fees associated with the
proposed rule; and (f) hiring employees
dedicated to compliance with regulatory
requirements.199

Thus, the “impact” on small entities
referred to in Section 603(a) refers only

197 For RFA purposes, the relevant economic
impact on small entities is the impact of
compliance with the rule. Mid-Tex Electric
Cooperative, Inc. v. FERC, 773 F.2d 327, 342 (D.C.
Cir. 1985), cited in SBA Guide, above, at 77.

198 NLRA Section 8(d) expressly states that the
obligation to bargain in good faith “does not compel
either party to agree to a proposal or require the
making of a concession|[.]” 29 U.S.C. 158(d).

199 SBA Guide, above, at 34.

to the rule’s projected compliance costs
to small entities (none of which would
result from posting a workplace notice),
not the kinds of speculative and indirect
economic impact that Baker & Daniels
LLC invokes,?°°

Associated Builders and Contractors,
Inc. (ABC) and Retail Industry Leaders
Association (RILA) contend that the
Board’s RFA analysis fails to account for
the costs of electronic notice posting,
especially for employers that
communicate with employees via
multiple electronic means. Both
comments deplore what they consider
to be the rule’s vague requirements in
this respect. ABC argues that clear
guidance is needed, and that the Board
should withdraw the electronic notice
posting requirements until more
information can be gathered. RILA
asserts that ‘“‘[d]eciphering and
complying with the Board’s
requirements would impose significant
legal and administrative costs and
inevitably result [in] litigation as parties
disagree about when a communication
is ‘customarily used,’ and whether and
when employees need to be informed
through multiple communications.”

Numerous comments assert that
employers, especially small employers
that lack professional human resources
staff, will incur significant legal
expenses as they attempt to comply
with the rule. For example, Fisher and
Phillips, a management law firm, urges
that the cost of legal fees should be
included in assessing the economic
impact of the proposed rule: “[I]t might
be considered naive to assume that a
significant percentage of small
employers would not seek the advice of
counsel, and it would be equally naive
to assume that a significant percentage
of those newly-engaged lawyers could
be retained for as little as $31.02/hour.”’

Those comments are not persuasive.
The choice to retain counsel is not a
requirement for complying with the
rule. This is not a complicated or
nuanced rule. The employer is only
required to post a notice provided by
the Board in the same manner in which
that employer customarily posts notices
to its employees. The Board has
explained above what the rule’s
electronic posting provisions require of
employers in general, and it has
simplified those provisions by
eliminating the requirement that notices
be provided by email and many other
forms of electronic communication.?°! It

200 Baker & Daniels LLP cites no authority to
support its contention that the RFA is concerned
with costs other than the costs of compliance with
the rule, and the Board is aware of none.

201 Contrary to ABC’s and RILA’s assertions, the
Board did estimate the cost of complying with the

should not be necessary for employers,
small or large, to add human resources
staff, retain counsel, or resort to
litigation if they have questions
concerning whether the proposed rule
applies to them or about the
requirements for technical compliance
with the rule, including how the
electronic posting provisions
specifically affect their enterprises.2°?
Such questions can be directed to the
Board’s regional offices, either by
telephone, personal visit, email, or
regular mail, and will be answered free
of charge by representatives of the
Board.293

Cass County Electric Cooperative
argues that the Board failed to take into
account legal expenses that employers
will incur if they fail to ‘follow the
letter of the proposed rule.” The
comment urges that the Board should
estimate the cost to businesses ‘‘should
they have to defend themselves against
an unfair labor practice for failure to
comply with the rule, no matter what
the circumstances for that failure might
be,’ presumably including failures to
post the notice by employers that are
unaware of the rule and inadvertent
failures to comply with technical
posting requirements. International
Foodservice Distributors Association
contends that the Board also should
have considered the costs of tolling the
statute of limitations when employers
fail to post the notice. However, the
costs referred to in these comments are
costs of not complying with the rule, not
compliance costs. As stated above, for
RFA purposes, the relevant economic
analysis focuses on the costs of
complying with the rule.2°

rule’s electronic notice posting requirements; its
estimated average cost of $62.04 specifically
included such costs. 75 FR 80415. Although ABC
faults the Board for failing to issue a preliminary
request for information (RFI) concerning the ways
employers communicate with employees
electronically, the Board did ask for comments
concerning its RFA certification in the NPRM, id.
at 80416. In this regard, ABC states only that “many
ABC member companies communicate with
employees through email or other electronic
means,” which the Board expressly contemplated
in the NPRM, id. at 80413, and which is also the
Board’s practice with respect to communicating
with its own employees. If ABC has more specific
information it has failed to provide it. In any event,
he final rule will not require email or many other
ypes of electronic notice.

202 Association of Corporate Counsel contends
hat employers will have to modify their policies
and procedures manuals as a result of the rule. The
Board questions that contention, but even if some
employers do take those steps, they would not be
a cost of complying with the rule.

203 Fisher and Phillips also suggest that the Board
ailed to take into account the effect that the
proposed rule would have on the Board’s own case
intake and budget. The RFA, however, does not
require an estimate of the economic effects of
proposed rules on Federal agencies.

cated acts of perception. In general-evolution language, what is posited here is that organisms
like humans contain chemical signals that signify organism-level success of various types, and
that these signals serve as a “fitness function” correlating with evolutionary fitness of neuronal
maps.

In Neural Darwinism and his other related books and papers, Edelman goes far beyond this
crude sketch and presents neuronal group selection as a collection of precise biological hypothe-
ses, and presents evidence in favor of a number of these hypotheses. However, we consider that
the basic concept of neuronal group selection is largely independent of the biological particular-
ities in terms of which Edelman has phrased it. We suspect that the mutation and selection of
“transformations” or “maps” is a necessary component of the dynamics of any intelligent system.

As we will see later on (e.g. in Chapter 42 of Part 2, this business of maps is extremely
important to CogPrime. CogPrime does not have simulated biological neurons and synapses,
but it does have Nodes and Links that in some contexts play loosely similar roles. We sometimes
think of CogPrime Nodes and Links as being very roughly analogous to Edelman’s neuronal
clusters, and emergent intercluster links. And we have maps among CogPrime Nodes and Links,
just as Edelman has maps among his neuronal clusters. Maps are not the sole bearers of meaning
in CogPrime, but they are significant ones.

There is a very natural connection between Edelman-style brain evolution and the ideas
about cognitive evolution presented in Chapter 3. Edelman proposes a fairly clear mechanism
via which patterns that survive a while in the brain are differentially likely to survive a long
time: this is basic Hebbian learning, which in Edelman’s picture plays a role between neuronal
groups. And, less directly, Edelman’s perspective also provides a mechanism by which intense
patterns will be differentially selected in the brain: because on the level of neural maps, pattern
intensity corresponds to the combination of compactness and functionality. Among a number
of roughly equally useful maps serving the same function, the more compact one will be more
likely to survive over time, because it is less likely to be disrupted by other brain processes
(such as other neural maps seeking to absorb its component neuronal groups into themselves).
Edelman’s neuroscience remains speculative, since so much remains unknown about human
neural structure and dynamics; but it does provide a tentative and plausible connection between
evolutionary neurodynamics and the more abstract sort of evolution that patternist philosophy
posits to occur in the realm of mind-patterns.

13.6 Glocal Memory

A glocal memory is one that transcends the global/local dichotomy and incorporates both
aspects in a tightly interconnected way. Here we make the glocal memory concept more precise,
and describe its incarnation in the context of attractor neural nets (which is similar to its
incarnation in CogPrime, to be elaborated in later chapters). Though our main interest here is
in glocality in CogPrime, we also suggest that glocality may be a critical property to consider
when analyzing human, animal and AI memory more broadly.

The notion of glocal memory has implicitly occurred in a number of prior brain theories
(without use of the neologism “glocal”), e.g. [Cal96] and [Goe01], but it has not previously been
explicitly developed. However the concept has risen to the fore in our recent AI work and so
we have chosen to flesh it out more fully in [HGO8], [GPI~ 10] and the present section.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016447.txt,"Virginia Roberts was working at Mar-a-Lago when she was recruited to be a masseuse to Palm Beach hedge fund

manager Jeffrey Epstein. She was lured into a life of depravity and sexual abuse.
BY EMILY MICHOT &% | JULIE K. BROWN

It was Epstein’s contacts with powerful and famous people that first propelled him
into the public spotlight. In 2002, he flew former President Bill Clinton, actor
Kevin Spacey, comedian Chris Tucker and others to South Africa on his private jet
as part of a fact-finding AIDS mission in support of the Clinton Foundation.

But Epstein, a Clinton donor who contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to
Democratic candidates and causes, realized that his Democratic connections
weren't going to help him in 2006, when the federal prosecutor was Acosta, a
conservative Republican appointed during the George W. Bush administration.

ENTER KENNETH STARR

Epstein’s tactic: hire the most aggressive and politically connected lawyers that his
money could buy.

At the top of his list: Kenneth Starr, a Republican icon because of his pursuit of
Bill Clinton during the Whitewater investigation, which led to the impeachment
(but not conviction) of the president after it was revealed he’d had sex with a
young White House intern. Like Acosta, Starr had worked at the prestigious law
firm Kirkland & Ellis. Epstein also tapped Jay Lefkowitz, also of Kirkland, who
worked as a domestic policy advisor and later as a special envoy to North Korea
during the George W. Bush presidency.

been more badly beaten, or killed. Still, I couldn’t be completely sure.

The truck lurched to a stop. We were led into a building, down a hallway and
into a large room. The walls were bare except for a series of iron rings. Our
captors tore the sacks from our heads for a few moments, and tied our wrists to
the manacles. For the first six or seven hours we were kept together, arms
shackled and raised. Then they took us away one by one. I was the last to be led
out. I was taken to a room so small there was not even space for a cot. It wasn’t
until the last shaft of light disappeared from the slit-like window near the top of
wall that the first interrogator showed up. He unlocked the door, entered and
unfolded a metal chair. He wanted answers: what unit was I from, what did our
unit do, who were our commanders, what were our orders, and what was our
designated role in the event of war.

I told him my name, rank and serial number. After each question, I repeated
them, or shook my head in silence. “You wi// answer, sooner or later,” he
shouted in heavily Arabic-accented Hebrew, hitting me across the face. “All of
you will.” For four days and nights, other interrogators shouted out the same
questions. I was slapped dozens of times. Punched in the stomach. One of the
captors uncuffed me and bent my arm behind my back, wrenching it upward.
Though I was determined not to cry out, I grunted in pain. Over and over, I told
myself: “This is not for real. They can hurt me. But they have limits. They can
twist my arm. They can hurt me. But there’s no way they can break my arm.”

I was not allowed to sleep. I was never left alone for more than a half-hour.
If I was crouching on the stone floor, I would be yanked to my feet and punched
or slapped. Twice a day, I was taken from my cell to a primitive toilet and given
a minute to relieve myself. There were only two changes to the routine. On a
few occasions, five or six of us were brought back into the large room and told
we wouldn’t be let go until we had given them more of what they wanted — the
implication being that some of us had already talked. And once or twice, the
interrogators sent in a good cop. “I can help you,” he told me. “But you have to
give me something.”

But when it was over, none of us had talked. We didn’t fool ourselves into
thinking that meant we could hold up in genuine captivity. There, they could
break your arm. They could burn your chest with cigarettes, rip out a fingernail
or a tooth. They could kill you. The main value had been to give us some sense
of what we might face. We might still be afraid, but at least it would no longer
be fear of the unknown.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026863.txt,"half of this international order—namely the complex web of multilateral institutions which
operate under international treaty law and which seek to govern the global commons on the
basis of the principle of shared sovereignty. As for “global governance”, it tends to refer to
the actual performance, for good or for ill, be it effective or ineffective, of the “international
system” so defined.

It is deeply significant that at the 2018 Work Conference, Xi Jinping states boldly that a core
component of his new ideology of a “diplomacy of socialism with Chinese characteristics”
would be for China to: “lead the reform of the global governance system with the concepts of
fairness and justice.” This is by far the most direct, unqualified and expansive statement on
China’s intentions on this important question we have seen.

China, like the rest of the international community, is acutely conscious of the dysfunctionality
of much of the current multilateral system. It also sees the US walking away from much of
the system as well: from the JCPOA which was agreed to by the UN Security Council; from
the UN’s Paris Agreement on Climate Change; its withdrawal from the UN Human Rights
Commission; its open defiance of the Refugees Convention; and its challenging of the
underlying fabric of the WTO.

Nature, as we know, abhors a vacuum. International relations even more so. And we all saw
Xi Jinping’s riposte to President Trump on climate change and trade at Davos 18 months ago
just after President Trump’s election. If China is indeed serious about leading the reform of
global governance, its attitude to various of these multilateral institutions will be radically
different to the historical posture of the US. Take for example the Human Rights Council in
Geneva, which China would like to see emasculated. Mind you, so too now, apparently, does
the current US administration!

The reference to “China leading the reform of global governance” in this conference is not an
accident. It also reflects a growing Chinese diplomatic activism in a number of UN and Bretton
Woods institutions around the world as China begins to seek to recast these institutions, their
cultures, their work practices and their personnel in a direction more compatible with China’s
core national interests. As I have written before, rather than China having to consistently
resist the pressures of “Westernisation” inherent in the existing laws, institutions and culture
of the current international system, particularly when these prove to be incompatible with the
retention of a Marxist-Leninist Chinese state, the resolve of China’s leadership now seems to
be to use its newfound global power to refashion those institutions within the international
system that may be most problematic for China on the home front.

As for the principles of fairness and justice that Xi refers to as the core principles that will
guide China’s reform of global governance, these terms historically imply China’s preference
for a more “multipolar” international system in which the unilateral voice of the United States
is reduced. China has already developed a strong constituency in Africa, parts of Asia and
Latin America in support of this. ‘Multipolarity’ in Chinese strategic parlance is code for the
dilution of American power in the post-war international system.

when that nation was still a Soviet Socialist Republic. Here he compares the dissidents
who brought down the Iron Curtain to the dissidents who are sounding the alarm about
rapid advances in artificial intelligence. He locates the roots of the current AI
dissidence, paradoxically, among such pioneers of the AI field as Wiener, Alan Turing,
and I. J. Good.

Jaan’s preoccupation is with existential risk, AI being among the most extreme of
many. In 2012, he co-founded the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk—an
interdisciplinary research institute that works to mitigate risks “associated with
emerging technologies and human activity” —at the University of Cambridge, along with
Philosopher Huw Price and Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal.

He once described himself to me as “a convinced consequentialist” —convinced
enough to have given away much of his entrepreneurial wealth to the Future of Life
Institute (of which he is a co-founder), the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, and
other such organizations working on risk reduction. Max Tegmark has written about
him: “Tf you’re an intelligent life-form reading this text millions of years from now and
marveling at how life is flourishing, you may owe your existence to Jaan.”

On a recent visit to London, Jaan and I participated on an AI panel for the
Serpentine Gallery’s Marathon at London’s City Hall, under the aegis of Hans Ulrich
Obrist (another contributor to this volume). This being the art world, there was a
glamorous dinner party that night in a mansion filled with London’s beautiful people—
artists, fashion models, oligarchs, stars of stage and screen. After working the room in
his unaffected manner (“Hi, I’m Jaan”), he suddenly said, “Time for hip-hop dancing,”
dropped to the floor on one hand, and began demonstrating his spectacular moves to the
bemused A-listers. Then off he went into the dance-club subculture, which is apparently
how he ends every evening when he’s on the road. Who knew?

together similar to normal families like eat dinner, watch TV, and travel it
was only the hedonistic and corrupt side to these two deviates that made
them a peculiar pair.

Getting turned on at the two of us playing together, Jeffrey came over
to the couch we were on and pulled down his sweatpants revealing his
erect manhood. All of the laughter stopped, now it was time for work.
Pushing my head into his pubic region I had to give into his perverted
wants. Ghislane started to undress me. Once I was bare she loved starting
with my breasts. She cupped them in her hands and brushed her fingers
over my hardened nipples heading downwards pressing her lips deeply
into my skin, I had to maneuver my body on the couch in a complex
position to give them both what they wanted. And just like that, without
even a moment’s notice I could be put on the spot and have to amuse
them in any way they wanted. A shameful way to make someone feel like
aused toy, I wasn’t around for companionship I was there for one thing, I
was a compliant piece of eye candy.

Twenty minutes later and Jeffrey had erupted in pleasure. Ghislane sat
up, still fully dressed, and wiped the sides of her mouth with her hands,
giving a vindictive little chuckle, “That was fun.” Jeffrey concurred with
asly grin arching his back for a stretch just looking able to utter the
request “Why don’t you come up with me upstairs for a steam bath and
massage, I need to be loosened up after that?” It was more of a statement
than a request, as if I had the choice to say “No thanks, I’m actually tired
myself and would love to just relax” instead | would reply with my
accustomed trained obedience, “No problem, when your ready lead the
way.” I had to get dressed again being that we were in Ghislane’s
downstairs office. Putting my clothes back on, Ghislane thought she had
buttered him up just where she wanted him to ask for him to come have a
look at her new townhouse renovations when he was finished with his
massage. A very strange relationship those two have, there’s a definite
love flowing between them but not a passionate one, more like a
respectful business, he gets what he wants...an uncountable number of
girls and she gets what she wants, simple and sweet...an uncountable
amount of money. The two things in life that can create such beautiful
moments or the most horrendously terrible of them all, is sex and money.

Chapter 15

I joined him for a shower, steam bath and concluded his needs with a
massage while listening to classical music. I knew he didn’t want
anything sexual from me now seeing he got what he already wanted
downstairs, no this one was purely therapeutic. My favorite massages to
give, making me feel like an actual real therapist. I lathered him in
aromatic oils and let my hands discover the ways to unlock the stresses
that his body held. After the massage was concluded we were going
downstairs to get ready to go see Ghislane’s townhouse as he had

promised her earlier. He loved taking the hidden staircase while | hated it.

I was so creeped out by his choice of décor, the blood red carpets, violent
medieval paintings, and sculptures of the pagan god Pan, all of it
representing the darker side of hedonism his lifestyle provoked. Spiraling
down the hallway along with each step you took came with a pair of eyes
that followed your every step. Brown, blue, green, hazel, all of the colors
were there, staring at you the entire way down. As each step progressed,
so would my anxiety to get out of there.

We found Ghislane where we had left her, in her office. She had just
received an order in, a satellite camera with a twelve-inch flat screen. She
told us how it was used to pick up any person in any location with the
quick insert of an address. Quite a powerful new toy I thought, but it was
only a minute display of what the rich could afford, what use they would
get out of it was another concern. Soon after she was done figuring out
the controls on the camera, we made a rare and first for me pit stop, the
security room. What I thought was our way out by the front door was
another hidden door. I was in shock as I was led into a room, so discreet
that in three years I never even knew it existed. | kept my head down
most of the time, knowing how secretive this must be being another door
was an entire security base within his mansion. What I could see when |
stole a glimpse here and there was an array of tiny screens, twenty odd or
something. Small screens showing various rooms of the mansion | had
recognized. The images were constantly changing so'l found it hard to
pinpoint an exact location but from the décor and short glimpses |
suddenly knew from then on that my feelings of my every move being
watched inside his corridors was now more than a possibility but was
actually happening. Jeffrey spoke to an obese Spanish guy at the desk,
whose job was to disgustingly overlook all of the video feedback. Kill
two birds with one stone Jeffrey thought, free porn to share with all of his
pedophile friends and when the occasion called for it, a security system
all at one expense. Ever consumed with making money as well as saving
it, | was again astonished at Jeffrey’s capabilities. | didn’t want to even
think how deep the video infiltrated, pretending like I never saw anything
at all I put the memory to the back of my mind and went on about my
day. Stopping at Ghislane’s new townhouse, another gift bought and paid

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020037.txt,"astonished as anyone—a kind of Stepford factotum, as absolutely dedicated to and tolerant
of Mr. Trump as anyone who had ever worked for him.

Shortly after Lewandowski, with whom Hicks had an on-and-off romantic relationship,
was fired in June 2016 for clashing with Trump family members, Hicks sat in Trump
Tower with Trump and his sons, worrying about Lewandowski’s treatment in the press and
wondering aloud how she might help him. Trump, who otherwise seemed to treat Hicks in
a protective and even paternal way, looked up and said, “Why? You’ve already done
enough for him. You’re the best piece of tail he’ll ever have,” sending Hicks running from
the room.

As new layers began to form around Trump, first as nominee and then as president-
elect, Hicks continued playing the role of his personal PR woman. She would remain his
constant shadow and the person with the best access to him. “Have you spoken to Hope?”
were among the words most frequently uttered in the West Wing.

Hicks, sponsored by Ivanka and ever loyal to her, was in fact thought of as Trump’s
real daughter, while Ivanka was thought of as his real wife. More functionally, but as
elementally, Hicks was the president’s chief media handler. She worked by the president’s
side, wholly separate from the White House’s forty-person-strong communications office.
The president’s personal message and image were entrusted to her—or, more accurately,
she was the president’s agent in retailing that message and image, which he trusted to no
one but himself. Together they formed something of a freelance operation.

Without any particular politics of her own, and, with her New York PR background,
quite looking down on the right-wing press, she was the president’s official liaison to the
mainstream media. The president had charged her with the ultimate job: a good write-up
in the New York Times.

That, in the president’s estimation, had yet failed to happen, “but Hope tries and tries,”
the president said.

On more than one occasion, after a day—one of the countless days—of particularly
bad notices, the president greeted her, affectionately, with “You must be the world’s worst
PR person.”

OOK Ok

In the early days of the transition, with Conway out of the running for the press secretary
job, Trump became determined to find a “star.” The conservative radio host Laura
Ingraham, who had spoken at the convention, was on the list, as was Ann Coulter. Fox
Business’s Maria Bartiromo was also under consideration. (This was television, the
president-elect said, and it ought to be a good-looking woman.) When none of those ideas
panned out, the job was offered to Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, who turned it down.

But there was a counterview: the press secretary ought to be the opposite of a star. In

T veny feet and closing.

“Run! Ruuuuuuuuuun!” Hans didn’t speak Portuguese, but the meaning was clear enough—haul ass.
His sneakers gripped firmly on the jagged rock, and he drove his chest forward toward 3,000 feet of
nothing.

He held his breath on the final step, and the panic drove him to near unconsciousness. His vision
blurred at the edges, closing to a single pinpoint of light, and then ... he floated. The all-consuming
celestial blue of the horizon hit his visual field an instant after he realized that the thermal updraft had
caught him and the wings of the paraglider. Fear was behind him on the mountaintop, and thousands of
feet above the resplendent green rain forest and pristine white beaches of Copacabana, Hans Keeling had
seen the light.

That was Sunday.

On Monday, Hans returned to his law office in Century City, Los Angeles’s posh corporate haven, and
promptly handed in his three-week notice. For nearly five years, he had faced his alarm clock with the
same dread: I have to do this for another 40-45 years? He had once slept under his desk at the office
after a punishing half-done project, only to wake up and continue on it the next morning. That same
morning, he had made himself a promise: two more times and I’m out of here. Strike number three came
the day before he left for his Brazilian vacation.

We all make these promises to ourselves, and Hans had done it before as well, but things were now

exceeds the applicable threshold amount
(see chart, below) for the year ($1,250 for
married persons filing separately).

Net Capital Gains/ Net Investment In-
come. AGI thresholds are also used in taxing
investment-type income:

a Net Capital Gains are taxed at the 20
percent maximum rate at levels beyond
which income would otherwise be

pushed into the 39.6 percent bracket

(for 2013, that applicable threshold
amount is $450,000 AGI for married
individuals filing joint returns and sur-
viving spouses, $425,000 for heads of
households, $400,000 for single indi-
viduals, and $225,000 for married in-
dividuals filing separate returns. (The
“regular” 15 percent capital gains rate
is likewise reduced to zero percent for
taxpayers in the 10 percent bracket—
a benefit that can be used by same-sex
couples where one partner has very
little income).

a Net Investment Income, as defined un-
der new Code Section 1411, is taxed
starting in 2013 at 3.8 percent, keyed
to a modified AGI threshold based on
filing status ($250,000 for joint filers;
$125,000 for married, filing separately;
and $200,000 for all others).

Deduction!Credit Thresholds. Thresholds
are also commonly used to restrict deductions,
credits and other benefits based upon adjusted
gross income and filing status:

IMPACT. Jn dealing with threshold
amounts, a benefits/drawbacks analysis gen-
erally depends upon the extent to which that
portion of any tax benefit below a thresh-
old amount would otherwise go unused by
one of the partners if filing separately. With
certain deductions, credits or contribution
levels, however, electing “married filing sep-
arately” status may relegate each spouse to
$0 benefit depending upon circumstances.

OTHER SAME-SEX COUPLE
INCOME TAX ISSUES

Being married for federal tax purposes—ex-
clusive of the right to any particular filing

status—can also give rise to additional tax
benefits and restrictions. The following sit-
uations may be particularly relevant in the
case of married same-sex couples after the
Supreme Court’s Windsor decision:

Dependency Exemptions. \n 2012, the
IRS explained on its website that if a child
is a qualifying child under Code Sec. 152(c)
and both parents are same-sex partners,
either parent, but not both, may claim a
dependency deduction for the qualifying
child if separate returns are filed. If both
parents can otherwise claim a dependency
deduction for the child on their income tax
returns, the IRS will treat the child as the
qualifying child of the parent with whom

“Same-sex couples may
find that the benefits of

filing a joint return may
not always be greater than
filing separately...”

the child resides for the longer period of
time. If the child resides with each parent
for the same amount of time during the tax
year, the IRS will treat the child as the quali-
fying child of the parent with the higher ad-

justed gross income.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020023.txt,"perfected a deft eye roll (referred to as the Anton eye roll). H. R. McMaster seemed to
wear a constant grimace and have perpetual steam rising from his bald head. (“What’s
wrong with him?” the president often asked.)

There was, of course, a higher rationale: the White House needed normal, sane, logical,
adult professionals. To a person, these pros saw themselves bringing positive attributes—
rational minds, analytic powers, significant professional experience—to a situation sorely
lacking those things. They were doing their bit to make things more normal and, therefore,
more stable. They were bulwarks, or saw themselves that way, against chaos,
impulsiveness, and stupidity. They were less Trump supporters than an antidote to Trump.

“Tf it all starts going south—more south than it is already going—I have no doubt that
Joe Hagin would himself take personal responsibility, and do what needed to be done,”
said a senior Republican figure in Washington, in an effort at self-reassurance, about the
former Bush staffer who now served as Trump’s deputy chief of staff for operations.

But this sense of duty and virtue involved a complicated calculation about your
positive effect on the White House versus its negative effect on you. In April, an email
originally copied to more than a dozen people went into far wider circulation when it was
forwarded and reforwarded. Purporting to represent the views of Gary Cohn and quite
succinctly summarizing the appalled sense in much of the White House, the email read:

It’s worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won’t read
anything—not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up
halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored. And his staff is
no better. Kushner is an entitled baby who knows nothing. Bannon is an arrogant
prick who thinks he’s smarter than he is. Trump is less a person than a collection of
terrible traits. No one will survive the first year but his family. I hate the work, but
feel I need to stay because I’m the only person there with a clue what he’s doing.
The reason so few jobs have been filled is that they only accept people who pass
ridiculous purity tests, even for midlevel policy-making jobs where the people will
never see the light of day. Iam in a constant state of shock and horror.

Still, the mess that might do serious damage to the nation, and, by association, to your
own brand, might be transcended if you were seen as the person, by dint of competence
and professional behavior, taking control of it.

Powell, who had come into the White House as an adviser to Ivanka Trump, rose, in
weeks, to a position on the National Security Council, and was then, suddenly, along with
Cohn, her Goldman colleague, a contender for some of the highest posts in the
administration.

At the same time, both she and Cohn were spending a good deal of time with their ad
hoc outside advisers on which way they might jump out of the White House. Powell could
eye seven-figure comms jobs at various Fortune 100 companies, or a C-suite future at a

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013837.txt,"Trex could be a different way of handling monthly and one-time goals. Ill use your example of an

Aston Martin’s monthly payment, a personal assistant’s monthly payment, and a trip to the Croatian
coast. While the first two should certainly be totaled and included in your target monthly income, the trip
is something that should be divided by the number of months between now and the dreamline’s total
time.

Thus if you had a six-month dreamline:

Aston Martin = 2,003 per month
Personal assistant = 400 per month
Croatian trip = 934 total, and thus 934/6 per month

Right now in the book and in the spreadsheet we have (2003 + 400 + 934) x 1.3 monthly expenses =
Target Monthly Income (or TMI).

But I think it should be (2003 + 400 + 934/6 x 1.3 monthly expenses = TMI.

Or, more generally: [Monthly Goals + (One-Time Goals / Total Months)] x 1.3 monthly expenses =
TMI.

— JARED , president, SET Consulting

6. Determine three steps for each of the four dreams in just the 6-month timeline and take the first
step now.

I’m not a big believer in long-term planning and far-off goals. In fact, I generally set 3-month and 6-
month dreamlines. The variables change too much and in-the-future distance becomes an excuse for
postponing action. The objective of this exercise isn’t, therefore, to outline every step from start to finish,
but to define the end goal, the required vehicle to achieve them (TMI, TDI), and build momentum with
critical first steps. From that point, it’s a matter of freeing time and generating the TMI, which the
following chapters cover.

First, let’s focus on those critical first steps. Define three steps for each dream that will get you closer
to its actualization. Set actions —simple, well-defined actions —for now, tomorrow (complete before 11
A.M.) and the day after (again completed before 11 A.M.).

Once you have three steps for each of the four goals, complete the three actions in the “now” column.
Do it now. Each should be simple enough to do in five minutes or less. If not, rachet it down. If it’s the
middle of the night and you can’t call someone, do something else now, such as send an e-mail, and set
the call for first thing tomorrow.

If the next stage is some form of research, get in touch with someone who knows the answer instead of
spending too much time in books or online, which can turn into paralysis by analysis. The best first step,
the one I recommend, is finding someone who’s done it and ask for advice on how to do the same. It’s
not hard.

Other options include setting a meeting or phone call with a trainer, mentor, or salesperson to build
momentum. Can you schedule a private class or a commitment that you'll feel bad about canceling? Use
guilt to your advantage.

Tomorrow becomes never. No matter how small the task, take the first step now!

reality, says Bokhari. Fatah, the ruling
faction of the PA, is essentially tanking. It's
really in a state of decline because of
corruption and charges of embezzlement.
It's got an aging leadership. There's no
dynamism left in the group. There's a lot of
factionalism. It's almost like an oligarchy.

Rawabi could be Qatar's way of
encouraging the currently-calm status quo
in the West Bank, but without obviously
upgrading their ties to Israel, or throwing
their money behind a political
establishment that they don't fully trust.
On one end they need to make sure Fatah
does not completely collapse or weaken to
the point where they're no longer coherent,
says Bokhari, and Hamas needs to be
shaped and contained and shepherded in a
way that it doesn't grow into anything
larger.

Though there are politics underlying
Qatar's investment in Rawabi, it is still,
inevitably, a financial decision. You have
serious people who have a lot at risk here,
Danin says. Their goal is not primarily to
make a political point. Their goal is to
recoup their investment and make some
money. Even resource-rich Qatar, which
wants to diversity its holdings in order to
hedge against long-term shifts in the oil
and natural gas market, cares whether its
investment choices pay off.

Jeffrey,

Iam certainly glad that you have thick skin and care little about what the press says. I am sorry that you
have to appear tolerant against intolerance.

From all appearances, you fulfill the challenge of Kipling when he said:
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

If all men count with you, but none too much.

In spite of outward appearances, I know very few know how you really feel and I can only hope that that
feeling is shown best in the naming of your airplane.

today.

Sunny spring days melted away the ice off the frozen streets of New
York and the harsh winter winds begun to gently blow away the dead
leaves, making the caged trees appear to have some form of life again. I
hated the cold winters there, it would only add to my depression being
locked indoors. Give me hot Florida days blistering in the sun where I
can swelter by a cool pool and sip cocktails with pieces of fruit and little
oriental umbrella’s floating around. What a vision of solace? Looking
around my extravagantly decorated mid-evil room I was reminded of the
desolation that I was more than accustomed too. Knowing it wouldn’t be
long before | was summoned again for another ritualistic occurrence in
fornicating with my master, [ hardly bothered to leave my assigned
chambers, scarcely being sent home for a moments break, I just accepted
my fate. As I predicted the intercom buzzed momentarily and I heard
Ghislane’s voice come over and request to meet them in Jeffrey’s study.
Not an odd call, I would often meet him there first so he could tie up
some unfinished business before heading to the dungeon, or what was
thought to be the massage room. Making my way down the hall, 1 had an
eerie feeling wash over me, as if I had several pairs of eyes on me,
watching my every move. A cold chill moved up my spine and I had to
move my thoughts elsewhere, too easy behind these walls to succumb to
my fearsome anxieties. I punched in number one once inside the elevator
and it took me down to the floor where Jeffrey and his surprise guest
were waiting with anticipation behind closed doors. I cracked open the
heavy wooden doors and a familiar face revealed itself. Definitely not
expected or pre-warned on my part but I already knew what he was here
for or at least why I was called down to the study. Prince Andrew had
that notorious cheesy grin slapped over his face, as he looked me up and
down like a shiny new car on display and he was about to take it for a test
drive. Ghislane led me to the decadent sofa he was lounging on and
twirled me around to give him a good lookover before sitting me down on
his lap. Like a show pony I knew exactly how they wanted me to be
paraded around, with the last of my dignity long lost, I had nothing more
to lose. It was easy to give them the reaction they desired, all T had too do
was pretend to be entertained by their lewd gestures, and when Andrew
cupped my breast with a doll made in his image, I only giggled away.
Ghislane wanted to take a picture of the bizarre scene and even got
Johanna, another one of Jeffrey’s so-called personal assistants, to come
sit on his other knee for the snapshot, giving the impression girls couldn’t
stay away from Randy Andy.

Many crude jokes later and | was asked to show Andrew to the upstairs
massage room. I’m sure he already knew where it was from previous

encounters with Jeffrey’s “staff” but | led the way anyways, as if he was
now my guest of honor. Entering into the dim room it took a few minutes
for my eyes to adjust to the darkness, but knowing my way around the
room was enough to find the shower. I turned on the steam room and
began to undress myself. Andrew followed my lead and disrobed,
throwing his attire to the floor. I wanted to run and hide feeling his hands
touch me again, but my servitude for Jeffrey kept me there. Getting out of
his stronghold I turned my attention to the steam filling up and tried to
turn his attention to the marble bench where | suggested he take a seat
while I rubbed his feet. By the look in his eyes I knew he could care less
about a foot massage, his real desires were being shown by the arousal
his body was forming. He indicated where he wanted me to touch him
and how. I fulfilled his seedy requests, but only just. There was no
pleasure in this for me, the only thing I derived from this event was to
sink further into my slumber of depression. | couldn’t remember a time
when I felt needed for anything other than my body or amusements
thereof. After his massage was thoroughly conducted | couldn’t wait to
get back to my room for another shower. Sitting on the floor of the
shower under the harsh spray of water, [ scrubbed my body where he
touched me. Feeling abhorrent and ashamed what I had become, I let the
water wash away the grime.

As the days progressed into nights and the nights followed a trail of
destructive months, my outlook on life had diminished into utter sadness.
[had lost my spark and my ability to look like I could handle the abusive
state of affairs I had drifted into. Sinking deeper in the euphoric state of
being on coke and pills, not only was my mentality dwindling away but
also my looks. I sure as hell didn’t feel like a seventeen year old anymore
and now I wasn’t looking like one. My eyes had dark circles underneath
them from not sleeping and my bones protruded from my skinny
waistline and chest. This made Jeffrey apprehensive in keeping me
around as often and before | had a moments notice, I was out of money
and looking for a job. When I questioned him what was happening, he
told me I wasn’t the same girl he had first met some time ago now and
looked like I needed a break from working so much. “ [’ll call you next
time I’m in town” was the last thing he said to me.

Chapter 13

Going back to an average teenagers life was more of a harder transition
than I would’ve ever thought. Jeffrey stopped paying my expensive rent
and I was forced to get off the drugs and look for a real job to feed and
shelter T.J and I. It was much harder than it sounded, but I was craving

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016866.txt,"LET’S ASPIRE TO MORE THAN MAKING OURSELVES OBSOLETE
Max Tegmark

Max Tegmark is an MIT physicist and AI researcher; president of the Future of Life
Institute; scientific director of the Foundational Questions Institute; and the author
of Our Mathematical Universe and Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial
Intelligence.

Although there’s great controversy about how and when AI will impact humanity, the
situation is clearer from a cosmic perspective: The technology-developing life that has
evolved on Earth is rushing to make itself obsolete without devoting much serious
thought to the consequences. This strikes me as embarrassingly lame, given that we can
create amazing opportunities for humanity to flourish like never before, if we dare to
steer a more ambitious course.

13.8 billion years after its birth, our Universe has become aware of itself. On a
small blue planet, tiny conscious parts of our Universe have discovered that what they
once thought was the sum total of existence was a minute part of something far grander: a
solar system in a galaxy in a universe with over 100 billion other galaxies, arranged into
an elaborate pattern of groups, clusters, and superclusters.

Consciousness is the cosmic awakening; it transformed our Universe from a
mindless zombie with no self-awareness into a living ecosystem harboring self-reflection,
beauty, hope, meaning, and purpose. Had that awakening never taken place, our
Universe would have been pointless—a gigantic waste of space. Should our Universe go
back to sleep permanently due to some cosmic calamity or self-inflicted mishap, it will
become meaningless again.

On the other hand, things could get even better. We don’t yet know whether we
humans are the only stargazers in the cosmos, or even the first, but we’ve already learned
enough about our Universe to know that it has the potential to wake up much more fully
than it has thus far. AI pioneers such as Norbert Wiener have taught us that a further
awakening of our Universe’s ability to process and experience information need not
require eons of additional evolution but perhaps mere decades of human scientific
ingenuity.

We may be like that first glimmer of self-awareness you experienced when you
emerged from sleep this morning, a premonition of the much greater consciousness that
would arrive once you opened your eyes and fully awoke. Perhaps artificial
superintelligence will enable life to spread throughout the cosmos and flourish for
billions or trillions of years, and perhaps this will be because of decisions we make here,
on our planet, in our lifetime.

Or humanity may soon go extinct, through some self-inflicted calamity caused by
the power of our technology growing faster than the wisdom with which we manage it.

The evolving debate about AI’s societal impact

Many thinkers dismiss the idea of superintelligence as science fiction, because they view
intelligence as something mysterious that can exist only in biological organisms—
especially humans—and as fundamentally limited to what today’s humans can do. But
from my perspective as a physicist, intelligence is simply a certain kind of information

of the earliest recruits to Company A. They shook my hand and motioned me
into a Jeep. As we drove out of the base, they peppered me with questions about
almost anything except the army: the kibbutz, school, sports. Then, Ben-Zvi
pulled the Jeep to the side of the road, turned around to face me and asked: “Is it
true you can pick locks?”

Yes, I said. “Do you want me to show you?” He said that wouldn’t be
necessary.

“Ts it true you can navigate? Read maps?” Nachmias asked. I said yes.

They drove me back to the base in silence. “OK,” Nachmias said. “You'll
probably hear from us.”

I didn’t. But as basic training was winding down, I got a further order: to
report to an address in Tzahala, a neighborhood in north Tel Aviv where a lot of
military officers lived. It was a small house with a metal gate outside. I was met
at the door by a man about 30 in shorts and a T-shirt who introduced himself as
Avraham Arnan. He led me inside. He unfurled a map of Jerusalem and the
surrounding hills. He pointed to a spot on the southwest of the city. He drew a
wide, curving line through the hills to a second point. “You know how to read a
map?” he asked. When I nodded, he said: “I want you to describe to me — just as
if you were walking on this line — exactly what you see, as you make your way
to the place I marked.” I used the elevation lines on the map as a guide, and the
positioning of the hills and woodland and villages on the map, and began
describing how each stage would look. When I was finished, his only response
was the hint of a smile. When he spoke, it wasn’t about the map. It was, again,
about picking locks. “How did you learn?” he asked. I explained how I'd cut
into the locks, figured out how they worked and made a set of tools to open
them. “Thank you,” he said. “You can return to your unit.”

Though he hadn’t said so, I got a feeling this was the Sayeret Matkal
equivalent of a final job interview. When I got back to Beersheva, I dug around
as discreetly as possible for details about Avraham Arnan. I learned he had
served in 1948 in the hills around Jerusalem, so he would have known first-hand
the terrain he asked me to describe. That, I guessed, explained the half-smile.
But I was entering my last week of tironut. 1 still had no idea whether I’d be
spending the next couple of years inside an APC — or in a sayeret whose
function was a mystery, beyond the fact it seemed less interested in whether my
boots were shined than whether I could pick a lock.

corresponding to the presence of a certain pattern). The condition may refer to something in
the world external to the system, or to something internal. For instance, the condition may be
observing a cat. In this case, the corresponding Concept vertex in the mind of Ben Goertzel
is the pattern of activity observed in Ben Goertzel’s brain when his eyes are open and he’s
looking in the direction of a cat. The notion of pattern of activity can be made rigorous using
mathematical pattern theory, as is described in The Hidden Pattern [Goe(6al.

Note that logical predicates, on the SMEPH level, appear as particular kinds of Concepts,
where the condition involves a predicate and an argument. For instance, suppose one wants to
know what happens inside Ben’s mind when he eats cheese. Then there is a Concept correspond-
ing to the condition of cheese-eating activity. But there may also be a Concept corresponding
to eating activity in general. If the Concept denoting the activity of eating X is generally eas-
ily computable from the Concepts for X and eating individually, then the eating Concept is
effectively acting as a predicate.

A SMEPH SchemaVertex, on the other hand, is like a Concept that’s defined in a time-
dependent way. One type of Schema refers to a habitual dynamical pattern of activity occurring
before and/or during some condition is met. For instance, the condition might be saying the
word Hello. In that case the corresponding SchemaVertex in the mind of Ben Goertzel is the
pattern of activity that generally occurs before he says Hello.

Another type of Schema refers to a habitual dynamical pattern of activity occurring after
some condition X is met. For instance, in the case of the Schema for adding two numbers, the
precondition X consists of the two numbers and the concept of addition. The Schema is then
what happens when the mind thinks of adding and thinks of two numbers.

Finally, there are Schema that refer to habitual dynamical activity patterns occurring after
some condition X is met and before some condition Y is met. In this case the Schema is viewed
as transforming X into Y. For instance, if X is the condition of meeting someone who is not a
friend, and Y is the condition of being friends with that person, then the habitually intervening
activities constitute the Schema for making friends.

14.3.2 SMEPH Edges

SMEPH edge types fall into two categories: functional and logical. Functional edges connect
Schema vertices to their input and outputs; logical edges refer mainly to conditional proba-
bilities, and in general are to be interpreted according to the semantics of Probabilistic Logic
Networks.

Let us begin with logical edges. The simplest case is the Subset edge, which denotes a
straightforward, extensional conditional probability. For instance, it may happen that whenever
the Concept for cat is present in a system, the Concept for animal is as well. Then we would
say

Subset cat animal

(Here we assume a notation where “R A B” denotes an Edge of type R between Vertices A and
On the other hand, it may be that 50% of the time that cat is present in the system, cute is
present as well: then we would say

Subset cat cute <.5>

Re: Good Morning America and Night Line interview with Jane Doe 3 
Dear Mr. Zucker: 
I represent Jeffrey Epstein. I have been informed by Producer James Hill that ABC 
intends to air an interview, conducted by a Good Morning America co-host, of a woman known 
in court papers as Jane Doe 3.1 I write to put you on notice that ABC's publication of Jane Doe 
3's accusations is grossly negligent or worse. The accusations, many of which relate to my 
client, relate to alleged conduct that occurred approximately 15 years ago. The current 
accusations are simply reformatted and embellished echoes of previous allegations, which were 
first made by Jane Doe 3 to tabloid publications in the United Kingdom in 2011 and which have 
no independent news value. These allegations were then and remain now uncorroborated and 
have been refuted or undermined by other, credible evidence. Indeed, a federal judge recently 
refused to consider these allegations in pending litigation, finding them immaterial and 
impertinent, while striking the allegations and denying Jane Doe 3s Motion to Join, See Jane 
Doe 1 and 2 v. United States, 08-CV-80736-KAM (S.D. Fla.), Dkt 324 at 5. In addition, in that 
very same litigation, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Timothy R. Slater filed a 
declaration stating that when Jane Doe 3 was interviewed by the FBI in 2007 she refused to 
cooperate with the investigation of Mr. Epstein declaring she wanted nothing to do with the 
matter. For ABC to air these untested allegations on national television as news when Jane 
Doe 3 intentionally declined eight years ago to subject these same allegations to verification by 
the FBI would be grossly irresponsible and severely damaging to Mr. Epstein and others. 
1 Mr. Hill informed me that she was waiving whatever rights to anonymity she might assert but I will, because of 
certain legal obligations, refer to her as Jane Doe 3. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028928 
This is particularly true when ABC knows or should know that several, very specific 
allegations of Jane Doe 3 have been rebutted and/or demonstrated by others to be false. For 
example, I understand that she has accused distinguished Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard 
Law School of sexual misconduct involving her. Professor Dershowitz has flatly denied that 
allegation under oath in a federal court proceeding. I further understand that Professor 
Dershowitz offered to play a tape recording for Mr. Hill that evidences that Jane Doe 3 has made 
recent contradictory statements—that is, that she was pressured into including Professor 
Dershowitz in her allegations and that she has a financial motive in making these allegations. 
The Duke of York and the Royal Palace have likewise unequivocally denied Jane Doe's 
similar allegations against the Duke. Surely, these unequivocal statements of denial of respected 
members of society are entitled to some deference by ABC, particularly where, as here, there is 
substantial evidence of bias, improper motive, and serious credibility problems of their accuser. 
Moreover, additional claims of Jane Doe 3 can be refuted with objective evidence that is 
readily obtainable by ABC. For example, she claims she was in the presence of both former 
President Clinton (after January 20, 2001, and before the summer of 2002) and former Vice 
President Gore (and his wife) at Mr. Epstein's Virgin Island home. I have been told by Mr. Hill 
that she claims to be 100% sure of the facts regarding President Clinton. The claims are 
completely uncorroborated and compellingly contradicted by others. Neither former President 
Clinton nor former Vice-President Gore and his wife have ever been present at Mr. Epstein's 
Virgin Island home. A review of United States Secret Service records, obtainable through a 
Freedom of Information Request would prove the falsity of the claim. Virgin Island government 
records would provide further confirmation. I also believe that Mr. Hill has been told by 
individuals with percipient knowledge that former President Clinton has never been to Mr. 
Epstein's Virgin Island home. Upon inquiry, I am certain that you would receive similar denials 
from Mr. and Mrs. Gore either directly or by or through their counsel Mr. Boies. Jane Doe 3's 
fabrication of these claims against respected former officials undermines completely the 
trustworthiness of each and every one of her remaining allegations. 
We would expect that, in the wake of the damning independent review of Rolling Stone's 
publications of rape allegations involving students at the University of Virginia, ABC would 
proceed with similar, uncorroborated allegations with extreme caution. At the very least, ABC 
has an obligation to verify—with independent evidence—the truthfulness of Jane Doe 3's 
claims. Merely declining to air those portions of her interview that relate to President Clinton 
and Vice-President Gore is insufficient. If ABC has concerns about her credibility with respect 
to any allegation, it must decline to republish all of her allegations. 
In June of 2008, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges that do not relate to 
Jane Doe 3. After an extensive investigation, the United States declined to prosecute Mr. Epstein 
and provided him with a Non-Prosecution Agreement. Mr. Epstein fully conformed to the 
responsibilities and obligations imposed on him by that agreement. Mr. Epstein is not engaged 
in public activities. He is a private person who has complied and continues to comply with his 
legal obligations, and he is attempting to move forward with his life in a productive way. The 
allegations of Jane Doe 3 are neither credible nor news worthy. ABC should not publish them.

engineering philanthropy, unique. They alone had such resources and will.
Now you have legions of people who have to give away vastly larger
fortunes than Rockefeller or Carnegie had at their disposal, or might even
have imagined.

“Except that it’s actually hard to give away this kind of dough,
without causing more problems than you’re solving.”

Epstein’s long-time business thesis is that the rich know very little
about their money. They may know about their own businesses, but the great
sums that are the result are an ultimate after thought and demand an entirely
different sort of intellectual discipline. The Forbes 400, says Epstein, not
immune to an amount of wonder, increased their wealth by $500 billion last
year, meaning, in effect, that every American billionaire makes more than
another billion every year. And, points out the 62-year-old Epstein, they will
almost all be dead in 30 years, most well before that, meaning $2 trillion,
compounding everyday, will have to be given away. “So, to understand the
future, what you have to begin to do is follow the money, not in Watergate-
like terms backwards, as in who has gotten it, but forwards to where it will
go and who will get it.”

Epstein can find himself echoing aspects of Thomas Piketty on the
inequities of the accumulation of wealth (“the divide is between people with
assets, which appreciate, and people without assets, who fail to advance—
that is, of course, the miracle of compounded interest”), except for the fact
that Epstein, knowing the rich, understands a curious point that Piketty
doesn’t: “Nobody, nobody, wants to give it to their children. Everybody now
has the modern appreciation that one of the curses of great wealth is that it
makes your kids weird and fucked up.”

Epstein’s position in this private allotment of a decent fraction of the
U.S. Gross Domestic Product is not as philanthropist but as a higher sort of
banker or guru or brain—a rich whisperer—making him, in addition to rich
himself, arguably, among the most influential people you’ ve never heard of.

Though, likely, you have heard of him, but not for his prowess with
high abstraction, but for a scandal of such luridness that he is, for a great
many, the poster child of the lawlessness of privilege and wealth, and for a
much smaller circle, the poster child for what can happen when you become
the target of a resentful world. He is that Epstein, according to the Daily
Mail—among his most dogged press antagonists—‘‘one of America’s most
notorious sex offenders.”

RE: O-1 Non-immigrant Visa Petition on behalf of Jean Luc Brunel
Dear Sir or Madam:

It in. an extreme pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for Mr. Jean
Lac Brunel. I provide this recommendation based on my knowledgr and
experience in the field of modeling, due to my established reputation and
work in the field as the Vladimir Yudashkin, director of 1 Mother Agency.
Kiev, Ukraine

I have known Jean Luc Brunel professionally for several, yeare through
our work together and, an my opinion, he is an extremely talented
individual with superb professional reputation. He is anjiextraordinarily
able coordinator who atrives for and attains a level of merit in his work
that only a few of hia contemporaries meet. He has the ability to
recognize the creative vision of his client within the tinic and budget
through hig careful and thoughtful choice of model casting combined
with his meticulous ability in the field. Jean Luc Brunel ib a true find in
our industry.

There are plenty of art directors out there. but none with the depth end
quality that Mr. Brunei possesses. He is unlike anyonc in this industry,
and I expect to see him continue to find great models in hie successful
career. Someone overflowing with talent as Jean Luc Brunel should be
given every opportunity to work in the United States, where he will have
the proper venues (c showcase his extraordinary talents.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should veu have any queations
regarding this matter. you fer vuur time and consideration.

FRANCIS FUKUYAMA: This really started with a practical concern
I had after dealing with failed states and nation-building issues in the
wake of September 11 and our nation-building efforts in Afghanistan
and Iraq. It seemed to me that the United States in particular didn’t
appreciate the difficulty of this kind of activity, because we didn’t
adequately understand how hard it was to establish institutions. When
I was at Johns Hopkins at SAIS [School of Advanced International
Studies] I ran an international-development program, focusing on
issues of anti-corruption and improving governance. And a lot of it
seemed premised on an overly optimistic faith in the ability of
outsiders to effect desired outcomes. So I decided to write a book
about where institutions came from in countries that had them and
could take them for granted. We’ve forgotten a lot of that history and
how we’ve gotten to the present. Along the way it was also a means
of revisiting a lot of The End of History 20 years later.

SHAFFER: Some theorists, like Hegel, think that history doesn’t just
tell us what is stable, or what works, but actually points us toward
moral progress. Do you believe that?

FUKUYAMA: Fundamentally, I believe in liberal democracy, that
it’s the best form of government, and that the world has made moral
progress. But that’s a separate question from whether the
development of democratic institutions 1s inevitable and driven by an
underlying historical force. I’ve become more skeptical of that latter
belief over the years as I’ve become more attentive to the role of
accident and contingency. And my current book is about a lot of that.
For example: The reason we got to democracy in Europe is the almost
accidental survival of a feudal institution — the English parliament —
into the modern period. That’s something that didn’t happen in other

authors’ recommendations—ratification of the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty. That treaty could lock us in to weapons designs that are
less safe and secure than others that might one day be developed, but
whose development might necessitate testing. (The current
administration’s ideological opposition to any innovation in the
design of our increasingly obsolete weapons—with the result that we
are not, for example, introducing technology to make them unusable,
should they fall into unauthorized hands—is overly rigid and
shortsighted. It is too bad that the authors of the statement didn’t
make this point.)

Shultz, Kissinger, et al. correctly urge that international measures be
taken to place control of the nuclear fuel cycle in safe hands. But
accomplishing this task is complicated by the legacy of the “Atoms
for Peace” concept dating back to the Eisenhower administration and
enshrined in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Rich in
unintended consequences, Atoms for Peace promised that nations
pledging (1.e., merely pledging) not to acquire nuclear weapons
would be eligible to receive assistance with their civilian nuclear
programs from the advanced nuclear powers. The problem is that the
infrastructure supporting civilian nuclear power gets you well down
the road to nuclear weapons. In fact, from its inception, Atoms for
Peace has spread nuclear technology around the world. India’s
nuclear program, for example, grew from its cooperation with
Canada, which supplied the reactor that enabled India’s bomb.

The NPT has become the poster child for opposition to the spread of
nuclear weapons. Yet, ironically, faith in its capacity actually to
restrain the proliferation of nuclear weapons is at least misplaced—
and possibly much worse. For one thing, the belief that the NPT is
robust enough, and its institutions effective enough, can easily
become an excuse for individual nations to do no more than the treaty

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010610.txt,"We estimate a regression of weekly returns on the MXN spot exchange rate on five
variables: a basket of commodity currencies, US equities, the 10-year US bond yield, the
two-year interest rate differential between MXN and USD swaps, and RealClearPolitics
polling average for Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. The estimated
equation is

RON = bo + by RO + bz *RPP™ + bstdy”? + ba — °°) + bs*RCP + @

where A” is the MXN spot return, A is the commodity currency basket spot return,
RO” is the SP500 index return, dy’’ is the 10-year US bond yield change, ““ - 7°’ is
the two-year swap rate differential (lagged one period), ACP is RealClearPolitics polling
average for Donald Trump, and eis an error term. The commodity currency basket
consists of BRL, CLP, COP, CAD, NOK and AUD with equal weights. The full data sample
has weekly frequency and runs from 6/20/2012 to 9/21/2016.

The model without Trump yields an R-squared coefficient of 0.50. Including Trump’s
variable increases the coefficient to 0.63, a significant improvement (Chart 2). We use
data only up to 1/27/2016 for parameter estimation of the financial variables. We use
the full sample to estimate the parameter on Trump’s variable due to its shorter history.

A possible 15% negative shock on MXN

According to the model that does not include Trump’s polling average, we estimate that
MXN should be trading at around 16.50, more than 15% stronger than current levels
(spot 19.72). Chart 2 shows the possible magnitude of the Trump effect on the Mexican
peso.

The model including Trump’s polling average appears to do a much better job at
explaining the recent behavior of the Mexican peso. However, it still suggests that the
currency has depreciated more than justified by Trump’s increase in recent polls. Based
on Trump’s increase to 43.9% (RealClearPolitics polling average on 21 September) from
39% (RealClearPolitics polling average on 29 June), our model suggests the Mexican
peso should be trading at around 18.50, still almost 7% stronger than current levels.

This, however, does not necessarily mean that MXN has oversold. The almost 5% gain in
Trump’s polling average since June could have had an outsized effect on MXN if those
gains took place in swing states, potentially leading to crucial Electoral College votes.

Strategy: neutral MXN for now

From a strategy standpoint, we recommend staying neutral the Mexican peso for now.
We believe the Mexican peso would likely strengthen significantly if Hillary Clinton wins
the US election. But there is still significant uncertainty. Net speculative long USD/MXN
positions are somewhat stretched, but could increase much more (Chart 3).

sustainable

WHY LOOK TO THE OCEAN?
� Sustainable drought-proof source of
water
� Concern for availability of fresh
surface water and groundwater
resources = regulatory pressure
� Decreasing costs due to technology
improvements
� Comparable costs to indirect potable
water reuse projects

TAMPA BAY DESALINATION FACILITY

PRE-TREATMENT IS KEY TO SUCCESS
� Protect the Membranes
� Screens remove shells,
creatures, wood and debris
greater than ¼ inch
� Heavier solids settled out via
flocculation and clarification
� Smaller solids filtered via
microfiltration membranes
� Ultraviolet light controls biological
activity and fouling
� Control scale formation by
adjusting pH and using
antiscalants
Fine screens
Clarification Basin
UV units

SPECIALIZED MEMBRANES FOR TREATMENT
� RO membranes allow water
particles (dissolved ions) to pass
through tiny screens, while
blocking salts
� Highly specialized technology
� Large amounts of power required
to “push” water through the
membranes via pressure
� Pre-treatment important to
protect costly membranes

SOLIDS HANDLING REQUIRED
Desalination produces “waste” streams that require
materials to be disposed via landfill.
� Debris removed by screens
(shells, wood, etc) must be
landfilled
� Clarification process &
microfiltration backwash solids
are thickened, dewatered, and
sent to the landfill for disposal
Transportation of solids increase facility operations cost
and result with a larger carbon footprint.

DESALINATION PLANT LAYOUT
DESALINATION PLANT ISSUES
� 25 mgd facility required to produce 10 mgd potable water.
� Approximately 10 acres required ed for infrastructure.
� Complex treatment processes.
� Brine by-product waste disposal via deep injection well
(ocean outfalls no longer permitted for WTPs).
� Dewatered sludge must be disposed at landfill.
� Highly energy intensive to operate.
� N t il t f d d t
� Not necessarily exempt from proposed year-round water
restrictions drafted by SFWMD

TREATMENT PROCESSES
� SOURCE
SOURCE - wells can be located near the plant. No
existing users to cause interference (today).
� PRE-TREATMENT
TREATMENT- disposable 5 micron cartridge
filters, pH adjustment, & scale inhibitor.
� MEMBRANES
MEMBRANES – Low Pressure Reverse Osmosis
elements require less power to push water thru screens.
� POST-TREATMENT
TREATMENT – hydrogen sulfide removal with
odor control, disinfection, pH adjustment, blending.
� DISTRIBUTION – connect to existing water main
network without subaqueous crossings.

FLORIDAN PLANT LAYOUT
LOCATION
The Floridan Aquifer wells are not restricted with respect
to specific location in that no other production wells exists
today near the City’s WTP.

FLORIDAN AQUIFER PLANT ISSUES
� Floridan Aquifers can be used for both Aquifer Storage
and Recovery and source water
� Potential increased energy costs associated with lifting i
water and impacts to adjacent users
� Potential for decline in water quality over time
~Some pumping wells become saltier (up-coning of
more saline water from below or laterally along coast)
~ Membrane design and periodic replacement
~Blending with Surficial Aquifer water
� Estimated 125% of raw water to meet treated water
demands
� Concentrate disposal via deep injection well

Fw: WPB/NYC Water Quality Data
Sarah,
We have obtained information about the water supply in NYC as requested. Note that the City of NY
produces about 33 times the amount of water than the City of West Palm Beach. We tried to compile
data that can be comparable. However, NYC act as their own State agency and track different
parameters than the State of Florida. See below for additional information.

Please let know if you want any changes made. NCY produces 1.1 billion mgd per day.
Below is what they say about their treatment process:
Water Treatment
All surface water and groundwater entering New York
City’s distribution system is treated with chlorine, fluoride,
food grade phosphoric acid and, in some cases, sodium
hydroxide. New York City uses chlorine to meet the New
York State Sanitary Code and federal Safe Drinking Water
Act (SDWA) disinfection requirements. Fluoride, at a
concentration of one part per million, is added to help
prevent tooth decay and has been added since 1966 in
accordance with the New York City Health Code. Phosphoric
acid is added to create a protective film on pipes that
reduces the release of metals such as lead from household
plumbing. Sodium hydroxide is added to Catskill/Delaware
water to raise the pH and reduce corrosivity.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent Drinking Water Testing Completed and the Results
The City of West Palm Beach (City) treats surface waters at their downtown facility and
produces drinking water for the residents of West Palm Beach. Residents of the Town of Palm
Beach (Town) receive potable water from the City through a franchise agreement that expires
in the year 2029. Due, in part, to the highly publicized  precautionary boil water notice issued
by the City in September of 2007, concerns arose regarding the overall safety of the drinking
water supply being provided to the Town. Accordingly, HSA Engineers and Scientists was
asked to collect and analyze additional samples from the water supply. These additional
samples were collected by HSA personnel on November 14, 2008 and were submitted to a
laboratory independent of the ones used by the City for their routine drinking water testing
requirements mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). There are more than 90 testing parameters
that are required to be analyzed on drinking water supplies by the USEPA and the FDEP. HSA
collected samples and tested for all of these drinking water parameters and the detailed results
are supplied in the enclosed tabular summary.
Also as shown in the attached detailed summary table, all of the testing results obtained from
our recent sampling passed and all constituents were well below the allowable limits
established by State and Federal regulations.
What are Trihalomethanes (THMs) and Why Did We Receive a Notice That They Were
Elevated?
During the precautionary boil water notice that occurred during the latter part of 2007, the City
added more chlorine to their finished drinking water to ensure adequate bacterial kill. Chlorine
reacts with natural organics (that cause variations in the water’s color) producing a group of
compounds called Trihalomethanes (THMs). Up to a point, the higher the chlorine dose added,
the higher the THM concentrations produced. The USEPA has established a limit of 80 parts
per billion (ppb) for drinking water supplies. In a few samples collected by the City during the
‘boil water notice’ time period, elevated THM test results were obtained due to the additional
chlorine in the drinking water. This represented a one-time spike in THM results and the
current level is well below the 80 parts per billion limit. During the special testing completed by
HSA, the THM level was measured at slightly more than 50 parts per billion, well below the
acceptable limit set by the regulators.

What Do I Need To Do To Ensure My Drinking Water is Safe?
Aside from the recent test results collected and analyzed by HSA, we reviewed historical test
results, also summarized in the enclosed table. The City produces a safe drinking water of
high quality based on the test results over the last several years. According to the USEPA and
the FDEP established standards, the City’s drinking water supply is of good quality and can be
consumed directly without concern. For those who want an added measure of protection,
substituting bottled drinking water is an option or under the kitchen counter reverse osmosis
(RO) filtration system can be installed as added intermediary treatment to provide an excellent
source of high quality of drinking water. These RO units are not cost prohibitive, can be easily
installed, and can usually supply sufficient drinking water for a typical household. A separate
tap is usually installed near the standard sink faucet so the RO water is delivered on demand.
There are several local reputable vendors that can provide free quotation for installing under
the kitchen counter RO units. Please note that the typical RO unit we are referring to does not
treat the entire household water supply but rather just the water intended for drinking or
cooking purposes.
To add a layer of confidence to residents’ concerns about the quality of the City’s drinking
water, we also recommend that the Town establish a primary point of contact for the City for
courtesy notification and/or discussion of real time details related to issues with the City’s
treatment and distribution processes. This could potentially avoid dramatized response to
typically less-detailed public notification.
INTRODUCTION
Residents of Palm Beach receive potable water from the City of West Palm Beach (City)
through a franchise agreement Town of Palm Beach (Town). As required under rule 62-550,
Florida Administrative Code, to protect the public health and ensure the quality of the delivered
potable water product, these taps are routinely sampled by the City of West Palm Beach’s
Public Utilities Department for specified monitoring parameters. Concerned about assuring the
quality of the potable water product delivered to Town residents by the City, the Town
authorized HSA Engineers & Scientists (HSA) to conduct a one-time sampling event from two
of the sampling taps on the potable water distribution system (piping) serving the Town.
Collected samples were targeted for laboratory analyses for regulated water chemistry
parameters, constituents, and microbiologics most likely to be present in South Florida drinking
water supplies.

CITY OF WEST PALM BEACH’S DRINKING WATER MONITORING PROGRAMS
HSA evaluated the City’s monitoring program and most recent results. Steve Schmidt,
laboratory manager at the City’s water treatment plant and Chris Saliba of U.S. Water,
Corporation, the City’s treatment system process and monitoring consultant, assisted with the
acquisition of sampling protocols and laboratory analytical documentation related to the City’s
drinking water monitoring program. Discussions with both yielded important information about
the City’s drinking water monitoring and quality assurance programs. In addition, records of the
City’s Monthly Operating Records (MORs) and recent results from the City’s water monitoring
programs were obtained from the Palm Beach County Health Department (part of the State of
Florida’s Department of Health, FDOH).
The City conducts two programs to monitor its drinking water quality, a Compliance Monitoring
Program (compliance) and a Routine Monitoring Program (routine). Sampling locations for the
City’s two monitoring programs include the surface water impoundments, inbound raw water,
aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) wells, treatment plant points of entry, distribution system
points of entry, and distribution system pumps and sampling taps. While Routine program
sampling events generally range from monthly to “as needed”, compliance program sampling
events generally range from daily to quarterly to annually to sampling for contaminants (like
asbestos) every ninth year.
To monitor the drinking water quality delivered to the Town, the City conducts routine sampling
at ten (10) permanent and temporary compliance distribution system sampling points (taps)
situated within the Town’s boundaries. These include:
• Distribution System Tap 3230 (located at 3230 S. Ocean Dr.);
• Distribution System Tap 2780 (located at 2780 S. Ocean Dr.);
• Distribution System Tap PBGC (located at the Palm Beach Golf Course);
• Distribution System Tap SOFS (located at the South Fire Station);
• Distribution System Tap ISRD (located at Island Rd.);
• Distribution System Tap RPBR (located at Royal Poinciana Blvd. X Bradley Pl.);
• Distribution System Tap NOFS (located at the North Fire Station);
• Distribution System Tap 702 (located at 702 N. County Rd.);
• Distribution System Tap LINL (located at List Rd. X N. Lake Wy.); and
• Distribution System Tap IDSE #6 (located at the north end of Ocean Blvd.);
Page 4 of 8
An eleventh distribution system tap, 4201, is located at 4201 South Ocean Boulevard (in the
South Palm Beach municipality), outside the jurisdiction of the Town. The Phipps Park
“Booster” Pumping Station (PS) is located within the Town’s jurisdiction. The Phipps Park
“Booster” is not a point of entry (POE) to the Town’s distribution system. The City’s map
indicates the locations of the sampling taps, the booster pump station, and a one million gallon
(1 MG) storage tank within the Town’s jurisdiction. Figure 1 depicts the distribution system
sampling taps, “booster” pumping station, and storage tank located within the Town’s
boundary.
The City conducts annual compliance sampling at several sampling locations, most notably
from the first point of entry (POE) to the distribution system. According to the City’s Water
Treatment Plant laboratory manager, the first POE is the tap located in the Water Treatment
Plant’s analytical laboratory.
POINTS OF ENTRY FOR THE CITY’S DELIVERY OF DRINKING WATER TO THE
TOWN
Plans of the distribution system serving the Town, provided by the Town’s Public Works
Department (PWD), identified five potable water transmission mains (large diameter pipes)
crossing the Intracoastal Waterway and connecting to the distribution system to deliver the
City’s potable water product to the Town. These five pipes include:
• A 24-inch diameter transmission main crossing the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) from/to
5th Street (in the City) to the eastern flank of the Royal Poinciana Bridge (in the
Town):
• A 16-inch diameter water main crossing the ICW from/to 45 th Street (in the City) to the
intersection of North Lake Way and Orange Grove Road (in the Town);
• A 16-inch diameter water main crossing the ICW from the southern end of Flagler Drive
(in the City) to the west end of “Sloan’s Curve (on State Road A1A, in the Town);
• A 16-inch diameter water main crossing the ICW from the intersection of Southern
Boulevard with Flagler Drive (in the City) to the eastern flank of the Southern
Boulevard Bridge (in the Town); and
• A 20-inch main crossing the ICW from the City to Everglades Island, near Barcelona
Avenue (in the Town).
Page 5 of 8
Figure 1 also depicts the approximate ICW crossings and points of entry (POEs) of the
transmission mains to the Town. The scale of the map does not allow an accurate depiction of
the POEs associated with the mains. Maps of the Town’s distribution system provided by the
PWD, generated at a significantly larger scale, were used to reference the locations of the
POEs for the transmission mains.
SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS OF THE DRINKING WATER PRODUCT DELIVERED TO
THE TOWN
As a means to independently evaluate the quality of the drinking water being delivered to the
Town, on November 14, 2008 HSA, accompanied by an employee of the City’s Public Utilities
Department, sampled distribution system tap IDSE #6, representing the northern-most extent
of the system, and tap 3230, representing the southern-most extent of the system,. Figure 1
depicts these sampling tap locations.
Sampling was performed by modification of the City’s (distribution system) General Sampling
Procedures to reflect the intended exclusion of sampling equipment, field parameter testing,
associated equipment calibration requirements. Samples were collected in laboratorysupplied,
unpreserved and pre-preserved containers. As required by select analytical
methodologies, at the sampling locations preservative was added to those sample containers
immediately prior to filling or to the water sample immediately prior to sealing the sample
container.
Collected water samples were submitted to FDOH/NELAC-certified testing laboratories for
analysis for typical public potable water system routine and compliance monitoring parameters
including Primary Drinking Water Standards (excluding select Disinfection Byproducts,
Haloacetic Acids; Bromite; and Chlorite), for Secondary Drinking Water Standards, and for
Total Coliform as listed in the Florida Administrative Code rule 62-550. Test America
Laboratories performed all of the analyses for chemical parameters. Jupiter Environmental
Laboratories performed the analyses for the microbiologics.
RESULTS FROM INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE CITY’S DRINKING WATER
PRODUCT
Results of laboratory analysis for target Primary and Secondary Drinking Standards yielded all
chemical and physical parameters below method detection limits (MDLs) or less than
respective maximum contaminant limits (MCLs).
Results of laboratory analysis for target microbiologicals yielded an absence of Total Coliform
in the water samples collected from northern-most Tap A (IDSE #6) and southern-most
Page 6 of 8
Tap B (3230). Table 1 arrays the target Primary and Secondary Drinking Standards, regulated
MCLs, required sampling frequency, and laboratory analytical results for the November 14,
2008-collected water samples.
Appendix A contains the laboratory analytical reports from HSA’s November 14, 2008
sampling event.
COMPARISON TO RECENT CITY MONITORING PROGRAM RESULTS
The City’s most recent annual compliance monitoring event for Primary and Secondary
Drinking Water Standards was performed in June 2008. The sample of ‘finished’ water product
was collected at a sampling point (laboratory tap) at the water treatment plant. Analysis was
performed by the City’s FDOH/NELAC-certified, vendor analytical laboratory, Genapure.
Analysis yielded all target parameter results below method detection limits (MDLs) or less than
respective maximum contaminant limits (MCLs) per Chapter 62-550, F.A.C.
The City’s most recent quarterly routine monitoring event for Nitrate and Nitrite was performed
in August 2008. The sample of ‘finished’ water product was also collected at the water
treatment plant’s laboratory tap. Analysis was again performed by the City’s vendor analytical
laboratory, Genapure. The detected concentration of Nitrate was less than the MCL (10 mg/L).
The concentration of Nitrite was below the MDL (< 0.053 mg/L). Nitrate concentrations from
HSA’s November 2008 sampling event are lower than either result reported from the City’s
annual or latest quarterly sampling from the water treatment plant’s laboratory tap. The
difference between these results is not relevant since the reported concentrations from the City
and from HSA’s sampling event are still less than the MCL.
Table 1 includes a comparative array of the City’s monitoring program results to the results
from HSA’s November 2008 distribution system tap sampling for the target Primary and
Secondary Drinking Standards.
APPLICATION OF DISINFECTION CHEMICALS, BYPRODUCTS, AND THE EFFECT ON
TASTE
To eliminate the presence of microbiologics, such as Coliform bacteria, the City applies
chlorine at the treatment plant to disinfect the processed supply water. This treatment process
results in the formation of chemical compounds in the potable water product known as
Disinfection Byproducts (DBPRs). The allowable concentrations of DBPRs in drinking water
are set as Standards in FDEP rule 62-550, F.A.C.
The latest quarterly (3-month) reporting period for the City’s weekly routine monitoring of
DBPRs (Total Trihalomethanes, TTHMs) ended September 2008. The samples of water
Page 7 of 8
product are regularly collected at a series of distribution system sampling taps. Analysis was
performed by the City’s analysts at the Water Treatment Plant’s laboratory. Results from
HSA’s sampling of the Town’s drinking water from northern-most Tap A (IDSE #6) are directly
compared to the City’s routine sampling of drinking water from distribution system tap LINL
(closest to Tap A). Results from HSA’s sampling of the Town’s drinking water from southernmost
Tap B (3230) are compared directly to those from the City’s sampling of that tap. TTHM
concentrations from HSA’s November 2008 sampling event are slightly higher than the
averages of the results reported from the City’s latest quarterly sampling from tap LINL and tap
3230, respectively. The difference between these results is not relevant since the reported
concentrations from the City and from HSA’s sampling event are still less than the MCL. It is
noted that the concentration of TTHMs reported from the City’s annual compliance event
(collected at the Treatment Plant) is close to the MCL. This is not unexpected as the sampling
location (treatment plant laboratory tap) is much closer to the point of disinfection than the
distribution system sampling taps. Table 1 includes a comparative array of the detected
TTHM’s from City’s monitoring program to those detected from HSA’s November 2008
sampling event as well as the TTHM Standards per rule 62-550, F.A.C.
The City Public Utilities Department acknowledges that to keep the potable water product free
of microbiologics occasionally requires increasing the concentration of disinfecting chlorine
added to the supply water. This results in brief incidences of potable water product with a
notable change in the taste and higher concentrations of DBPRs. Concentrations of DBPRs
and the stronger taste of chlorine subside with the inevitable reduction of chlorination.
CONCLUSION
As a measure of the quality of the drinking water product being delivered to the Town by the
City, results from HSA’s November 2008 collection of potable water from the northern-most
and southern-most distribution system sampling taps revealed target regulated drinking water
parameters at concentrations below the MCL standards established in FDEP rule 62-770,
F.A.C.
A comparative of the results obtained from HSA’s sampling event to the City’s reported annual
and quarterly results from 2008 monitoring events found minor variations in reported
concentrations for select parameters (see Table 1). These variations pose no concern for the
quality of the potable water product being delivered to the Town since all parameter
concentrations reported from the City’s monitoring events and by HSA’s sampling event are
less than respective MCLs.
Page 8 of 8
Comparison of a three-year average of the concentrations of Primary and Secondary Drinking
Water Standards from the City’s annual compliance monitoring events (circa 2006, 2007, and
2008) to the results from HSA’s November 2008 distribution system tap sampling reveals
relative equivalence with irrelevant differences between select parameters concentrations since
the averaged City results are less than respective MCLs (see Table 1).
With the exception of the occasional spike in concentrations of DBPRs (and corresponding
stronger taste of chlorine in the delivered drinking water) resulting from the City’s need to
increase the application of sanitizing chemicals (i.e. chlorine) to treat supply water, HSA
concludes that the quality of the potable water product delivered to the Town by the City meets
or beats the criteria for the standards established under rule 62-550, F.A.C.

Moreover, the discovery that Edwards pursued has to be considered against the
backdrop of Epstein’s obstructionist tactics. In both this case and all other cases filed
against him, Epstein asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege rather than answer any
substantive questions. Epstein also helped secure attorneys for his household staff
who assisted in the process of recruiting the minor girls, and those staff members in
turn also asserted their Fifth Amendment rights rather than explain what happened
behind closed doors in Epstein’s mansion in West Palm Beach. It is against this
backdrop that Edwards followed up on one of the only remaining lines of inquiry open
to him: discovery aimed at those of Epstein’s friends reasonably believed to have been
in a position to corroborate the fact that Epstein was sexually abusing young girls.

In the context of the sexual assault cases that Edwards had filed against Epstein, any
act of sexual abuse had undeniable relevance to the case — even acts of abuse Epstein
committed against minor girls other than L.M., E.W., or Jane Doe. Both federal and
state evidence rules made acts of child abuse against other girls admissible in the
plaintiffs case in chief as proof of “modus operandi” or “motive” or “common
scheme or plan.” The anxiously anticipated trial of this case will present the first full
disclosure of the evidence of the extent of Epstein’s criminal conduct in explanation of
the reason for and the extent of his malice toward Bradley Edwards.

Epstein’s repeated invocations of the Fifth Amendment raise adverse inferences
against him that leave no possibility that a reasonable factfinder could have ever
reached a verdict in his favor. Instead, a reasonable finder of fact could only find that
Epstein was a serial molester of children who was being held accountable through
legitimate suits brought by Edwards and others on behalf of the minor girls that
Epstein victimized.

“[I]t is well-settled that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences
against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative
evidence offered against them.” Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976);
accord Vasquez v. State, 777 So.2d 1200, 1203 (Fla. App. 2001). The reason for this
rule “is both logical and utilitarian. A party may not trample upon the rights of others
and then escape the consequences by invoking a constitutional privilege — at least not
in a civil setting.” Fraser v. Security and Inv. Corp., 615 So.2d 841, 842 (Fla. 4! Dist.

263 U.S. 149, 153-154 (1923) (Brandeis, J.).

In the circumstances of this case, a reasonable finder of fact would have “evidence of
the most persuasive character” from Epstein’s repeated refusal to answer questions
propounded to him. To provide but a few examples, here are questions that Epstein

By Brett Clarkson, Sun Sentinel

Did a Palm Beach billionaire being investigated for having sex with young girls use his wealth to negotiate a lenient and secret agreement that saw him avoid federal prosecution?
 
Attorneys for two victims, known only as Jane Doe 1 and 2, may soon get an answer thanks to an appeals court ruling against financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, 61.
 
The ruling, issued Friday, orders federal authorities to disclose the correspondence that took place between Epstein's attorneys and federal prosecutors when they were negotiating a 2007 agreement, which allowed him to escape federal prosecution if he pleaded guilty to state charges that carried a lesser penalty.
 
We're trying to figure out if Epstein used his political connections and great wealth to secure this kind of arrangement, that was unheard of, frankly, if you look at these charges, said Paul Cassell, an attorney for the women.
 
Epstein is a native New Yorker who according to media reports built a huge fortune as a money manager and owns several properties including a primary residence in Manhattan, a Palm Beach mansion and his own island in the Caribbean. At one point he counted among his friends former President Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and other high-powered figures.
 
The appeal court decision described the background of Epstein's case, stating that in 2006, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating allegations that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused several minor girls.
 
In September 2007, federal prosecutors struck the non-prosecution deal with Epstein, but didn't tell the victims, court filings say.

Not only did the United States neglect to confer with the victims before it entered into the agreement with Epstein, it also failed to notify them of its existence for at least nine months, Circuit Judge William H. Pryor wrote in the appeals court decision.
 
In June 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He spent 13 months behind bars, and is registered as a sex offender in Florida.
 
The situation also resulted in civil suits being filed against Epstein, who according to media reports settled claims from about two dozen young women who alleged he paid them for sexual massages at his Palm Beach mansion, some as young as 14, according to media reports.
 
To the attorneys who represent the Jane Does 1 and 2, the sentence was much lighter than the years, or possibly decades, that Epstein could've spent behind bars had he been prosecuted in the federal system.
 
They're hoping that the correspondence, ordered released by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, will shed light on what they say is an unusually lenient deal.
 
I can say that I've been teaching criminal law for more than two decades and I have never seen a plea agreement as lenient as this one, for hands-on sex offenders, said Cassell, who is based in Salt Lake City.
 
But one of Epstein's attorney's, Martin Weinberg, based in Boston, disputed those characterizations. Weinberg said Monday that the plea agreement was reached in good faith and that it's not a fair conclusion to describe the agreement as either improper or tainted by Epstein's wealth.
 
It's Mr. Cassell's hope that this correspondence may support that theory, but the reality is that the U.S. Attorney's Office made a responsible judgment in how to implement the law, Weinberg said.
 
Weinberg said he was concerned about the potential impact the ruling would have on the ability of criminal defense attorneys and prosecutors to communicate confidentially.
 
He also said he and Epstein co-counsel, Miami criminal defense attorney Roy Black, will ask the Atlanta-based appeals court to review the decision.
 
As for the Jane Does, who are now over 18, it's just the latest development in a long legal saga, another one of their attorneys said.
 
They're pretty numb at this point to favorable news because they've heard this before and nothing's happened, said Fort Lauderdale attorney Brad Edwards.
 
Edwards and Cassel said their goal is to have Epstein's plea agreement deemed to be in violation of federal victims' rights legislation and invalidated. Edwards said Epstein should face a new prosecution.
 
Edwards also said he was first told by the U.S. Attorney's Office that he would receive the correspondence documents on Monday, but was then told that they weren't ready yet. Cassell said the documents number 500 pages.
 
In an email, Annette Castillo, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of Florida, said the office couldn't comment.

The original version of this article can be found on the Internet, but please note that I've
done some editing for clarity. Here's the original:

ACTIVISM:
[theory] Colonized Libidos

This article was published at CarnalNation.com in early 2010. Anti-oppression theory
sure can get out of touch with reality.

te ok ok

Colonized Libidos

The situation for gay / lesbian rights here in Africa has gotten lots of media attention
lately, and I myself have written about meeting a Swazi lesbian activist who was later
murdered. So I won't waste your time by talking about how bad it can get to be gay here
(although it's worth noting that I've seen at least one interesting argument about how the
places in Africa where homosexuality is most heavily punished are also the ones with the
strongest national dialogue, and thus arguably some of the best ones to actually be gay).
Besides, I've become somewhat numb to the situation's sheer awfulness since arriving last
year. What catches my attention these days is unfamiliar cultural angles and arguments.

While reading the local paper, I recently came upon yet another gay-shaming article --
but instead of railing about God's will, the article talked about cultural imperialism.
Specifically, it argued that gays and lesbians are gay and lesbian only because of the
West. Gays and lesbians, the theory goes, have been so influenced by the Sodom and
Gomorrah that is the West that they've internalized our permissive, scandalous sexual
mores. (Those of us who actually come from the West are, of course, a little confused by
how our fractured native cultures -- still fiercely arguing about homosexuality within
themselves -- might create such an influence.) An African proud of his or her
Africanness, who rejects the colonial West, will therefore not only wear African
traditional garb and participate in African traditional ceremonies but will also be straight.
(Ironically, some historians have pointed out that much of Africa was much less
homophobic before Western missionaries came in.)

I got a front-line view of this attitude when I took a newspaper to the Post Office for
photocopying. Another article about lesbians! snorted the postmaster -- they're getting
to know me around there. He took the papers from me and shuffled through my requested
pages. Is it true,” he asked, that President Obama supports lesbians?”

Yes, I said.

The infinity library would contain every possible symphony, theorem,
novel, poem, and play ever written, or to be written. Its sister library
next door, the continuum library, would contain all the analogue works
of art; painting, sculpture, architecture, physical artifacts and the like.
The curators of the two libraries would constantly argue over whose
collection was the better. We'll leave them to differ for the moment. The
infinity library is interesting enough so let's explore it first. After all, its
sister, the continuum library, takes an infinite amount of time just to look
at the first room, and we are in a hurry!

Although the infinity library is infinite, we are probably only
concerned with entries shorter than a million symbols. All the interesting
papers, proofs and symphonies I know of are shorter than this. If wanted
to include all computer programs, I would still only need to increase it to
100 million symbols. Looking for knowledge is not itself an infinite task.

For the sake of clarity, I will ask the infinity librarian to organize
the collection. Any book or paper will be sorted according to its title and
the contents of its pages, and similar books should be grouped together.
I also only want to look at the English section of the library for the
moment. I will still have a huge section to look through but at least every
work is titled and readable by me. Much of the information will be junk
but amongst the sea of rubbish will be islands of useful knowledge. Now,
is there a way to find knowledge in this library in an automated fashion?

Can we do better at making feminist discourses around gender and sexuality open to
normative men, without driving ourselves crazy? How can we make our movement open
to, and accepting of, normative men? Put another way, how do we convince normative
men to support us?

Maybe we don't need a lot of normative men in the camp of sex and gender radicals;
maybe we'll be happier without silly Gender Studies 101 questions clotting our
discussions. Still, even if we don't try to recruit them, I'd love to see more widespread
analysis of masculinity and masculine sexuality amongst normative dudes... if only
because getting a sense for their societal boxes might simply make them happier. If only
because I think they've got their own liberation to strive for.

So at the very least, I'd like to contribute to an America where serious examination of
masculinity and male sexuality can flourish.

That's my final question. How do I do it?

They filed criminal charges against the executives responsible.

Before Morgenthau, the Department of Justice focused on two-bit corporate misdeeds—
Ponzi schemes and boiler room operations. Morgenthau changed that. His prosecutors went
after CEOs and their enablers—the accountants and lawyers who abetted the frauds or
looked the other way. “How do you justify prosecuting a nineteen-year old who sells drugs
on a street corner when you say it’s too complicated to go after the people who move the
money?” he once asked.

Morgenthau’s years as United States Attorney were followed by political success. He was
elected New York County District Attorney in 1974, the first of seven consecutive terms for
that office.

There are parallels between Morgenthau, and Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the
Southern District who was fired by President Trump this weekend.

Like Morgenthau, the 48-year old Bharara leaves the office of US Attorney for the Southern
District celebrated for taking on corrupt and powerful politicians. Bharara prosecuted two of
the infamous “three men in a room” who ran New York state: Sheldon Silver, the
Democratic speaker of the assembly and Dean Skelos, the Republican Senate majority
leader.

He won convictions of a startling array of local politicians, carrying on the work of the
Moreland Commission, an ethics inquiry created and then dismissed by New York’s Gov.
Andrew Cuomo. (This weekend, Bharara cryptically tweeted that “I know what the
Moreland Commission must have felt like,” a suggestion that he was fired as he was
pursuing cases pointed at Trump or his allies.)

But the record shows that Bharara was much less aggressive when it came to confronting
Wall Street’s misdeeds.

President Obama appointed Bharara in 2009, amid the wreckage of the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression. He inherited ongoing investigations into the collapse, including
a probe against Lehman Brothers.

He also inherited something he and his young charges found more alluring: mnsider-trading
cases against hedge fund managers. His office focused obsessively on those. At one point,
the Southern District racked up a record of 85-0 in those cases. (Appeals courts would later
throw out two prominent convictions, infuriating him and dealing blows to several other
cases.)

Hedge funds are safer targets. The firms aren’t enmeshed in the global financial markets in
the way that giant banks are. Insider trading cases are relatively easy to win and don’t
address systemic abuses that helped bring down the financial system.

Federal jury decides Middle East bank did not defraud Orange County entrepreneur<http://fw.to/aXv1QHI>

[Farooq Bajwa]
Farooq Bajwa

By Andrew Khouri

August 11, 2016

A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East’s most prominent banks did not commit fraud
and steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their
partnership collapsed.

Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment
system because it didn’t want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan’s technology to launch its own service.
The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan’s technology. It argued that it cancelled
the partnership because InfoSpan couldn’t produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an
established company, not one with little to no track record.

After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and
theft of trade secrets.

InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the
possibility of an appeal.

The verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile
attorneys on both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama.

At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back
home through text messages.

Bajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the
business and technology.

To launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled
by the United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund.

It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine
company that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s

The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-
made market for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply
than Western Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system.

A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal’s
fifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees.

But the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009.

A few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they
defrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology.

Two years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was
working and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to
launch its own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan’s technology.

In court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it
abhorred how much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm.

“They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money,” attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing
arguments Wednesday.

Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator
David Boies — argued that the bank resorted to “pure extortion” in an attempt to get its way.

As a result of the bank’s criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa’s partner, Larry Scudder, was detained
at the Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours

Even people paid to see the future didn’t see that one coming.

“The board’s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term
problems coming around the corner,” Mr. Thiel said. “We were far from perfect in
doing that.”

Mr. Thiel, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley,
ranging from the tech elite’s fascination with New Zealand hideaways (Mr. Thiel
obtained New Zealand citizenship) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the
problems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to
escape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the
creation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger
audience).

Two subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: President Trump,
whom Mr. Thiel aggressively backed for president, and Facebook, whose core
mission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a
typical Thiel move — he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley
peers try to make themselves inconspicuous — he agreed, in a rare interview, to
talk about both.

“It’s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,” Mr. Thiel said in his new
Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally
looks down on Trump Tower.

Despite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between Mr. Thiel and Mr.
Trump seems to have cooled. After Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National

wanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.

What Do | Need To Do To Ensure My Drinking Water is Safe?

Aside from the recent test results collected and analyzed by HSA, we reviewed historical test
results, also summarized in the enclosed table. The City produces a safe drinking water of
high quality based on the test results over the last several years. According to the USEPA and
the FDEP established standards, the City’s drinking water supply is of good quality and can be
consumed directly without concern. For those who want an added measure of protection,
substituting bottled drinking water is an option or under the kitchen counter reverse osmosis
(RO) filtration system can be installed as added intermediary treatment to provide an excellent
source of high quality of drinking water. These RO units are not cost prohibitive, can be easily
installed, and can usually supply sufficient drinking water for a typical household. A separate
tap is usually installed near the standard sink faucet so the RO water is delivered on demand.
There are several local reputable vendors that can provide free quotation for installing under
the kitchen counter RO units. Please note that the typical RO unit we are referring to does not
treat the entire household water supply but rather just the water intended for drinking or
cooking purposes.

To add a layer of confidence to residents’ concerns about the quality of the City’s drinking
water, we also recommend that the Town establish a primary point of contact for the City for
courtesy notification and/or discussion of real time details related to issues with the City’s
treatment and distribution processes. This could potentially avoid dramatized response to
typically less-detailed public notification.

INTRODUCTION

Residents of Palm Beach receive potable water from the City of West Palm Beach (City)
through a franchise agreement Town of Palm Beach (Town). As required under rule 62-550,
Florida Administrative Code, to protect the public health and ensure the quality of the delivered
potable water product, these taps are routinely sampled by the City of West Palm Beach’s
Public Utilities Department for specified monitoring parameters. Concerned about assuring the
quality of the potable water product delivered to Town residents by the City, the Town
authorized HSA Engineers & Scientists (HSA) to conduct a one-time sampling event from two
of the sampling taps on the potable water distribution system (piping) serving the Town.
Collected samples were targeted for laboratory analyses for regulated water chemistry
parameters, constituents, and microbiologics most likely to be present in South Florida drinking
water supplies.

corruption strategies or help in improving the delivery of services that
citizens want.

Beyond these relatively minor adjustments, a more robust theory of
social change might tell us that, in certain circumstances, the best
way to destabilize an authoritarian society would be not the funding
of civil society groups seeking short-term regime change, but rather
the promotion of rapid economic growth and the expansion of
educational access.5 Conversely, there are many societies we know
will simply waste development assistance dollars because they are
ruled by unaccountable authoritarian regimes. In such circumstances,
it might be a more efficient use of aid resources to cut development
aid entirely and to work only for political change. This is, in effect,
what has happened to Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe, but the
country had to sink very far before anyone considered pulling the aid
plug.

Huntington got a number of things wrong. The authoritarian
transition was not a universally applicable formula for development.
It worked reasonably well in East Asia, where there were a number of
figures like Lee Kwan Yew, Park Chung-hee or the Chinese
Communist Party leadership, who used their autocratic powers to
promote rapid development and social change. Arab authoritarians
were cut from a different cloth, content to preside over economically
stagnant societies. The result was not a coherent development
strategy but a wasted generation.

The aspiration of social science to replicate the predictability and
formality of certain natural sciences is, in the end, a hopeless
endeavor. Human societies, as Friedrich Hayek, Karl Popper and
others understood, are far too complex to model at an aggregate level.
Contemporary macroeconomics, despite dealing with social
phenomena that are inherently quantified, is today in crisis due to its
utter failure to anticipate the recent financial crisis.

Noam

On Iran, as usual, I’m a gloomy contrarian. I’m glad the treaty was signed, and it’s kind of fun to watch the
Republican lunatics shrieking hysterically as they try to kill it (as they may). And Israeli hypocrisy has gone
well beyond being comical. But in fact the whole thing is farcical, in my opinon. In the US, Iran is “the
greatest threat to world peace”, intoned constantly from on high, in the media, everywhere. There is also such a
thing as world opinion, as measured by such ultra-radicals as Gallup. It turns out that the greatest threat to
world peace is the US, by a very wide margin, no one else even close, and Iran barely mentioned. The
American population is protected from these unwanted facts by the Free Press: not reported. There is an
organization called US intelligence. They brief Congress regularly on the international security situation, all
quite public. On Iran, they point out that it has very limited military power, even by regional standards (a small
fraction of Saudi Arabia, for example). Its strategic doctrine is defensive. If—a big If—it has plans for nuclear
weapons, that would be part of its deterrent strategy. Now who would be opposed to Iran having a deterrent
strategy? Answer is clear: the rogue states that rampage violently in the region and don’t want any impediment:
the US and Israel, also lesser ones like UK and France. One simple way to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons
would be to establish a nuclear-weapons free zone in the region, as has been done elsewhere (over US
objections). That’s been advocated by the Arab states for 20 years, with very wide global support, including
Iran. It comes up regularly at the 5-year review meetings of the Nonproliferation Treaty, at the UN, again a few
months ago, when, again, it was blocked by the US to protect its Israeli client, which has a huge nuclear
weapons arsenal and wants to keep it. Again, the population is protected from such facts by the Free Press
(though in this case there are some fringe exceptions, and of course the Arms Control literature). Same with the
rest of the litany. Reading the US and UK press is like living in some lunatic asylum. I’m wondering whether
to write about it — again; have done so repeatedly. It’s like talking to a wall. Iran has an awful government,
though by the standards of such US allies as Saudi Arabia, it’s practically heaven.

Nevertheless, better to have the treaty than not to, given the nature of the asylum.

not (i) a Principal, (ii) a family member of a Principal, (iii} an employee of a Principal or any entity
controlled by one or more of the Principals, and (b} meet the definition of “independent director’ set forth
in Rule 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (as if the General Partner,
KUE and each of its Subsidiaries were the ‘listed company”) , including any such individuals appointed by
the investors who otherwise satisfy the requirements of this definition.

At the time of the final closing of this offering, the General Partner will have at least two Independent
Directors. After the Initial Listing and sc long as consistent with contractual, listing and licensing
obligations, a majority of the board of directors of the listed company will be Independent Directors.

“Initial Listing” means a listing on a recognized international securities exchange with a substantially
concurrent underwritten offering generating gross proceeds of U.S. $200 million or more. “Initial Listing’
refers to the Initial Listing of KUE or any successor or any subsidiary of KUE to which substantially all of
KUE's assets and liabilities have been transferred or are held.

The General Partner may take and cause KUE to take such actions as the General Partner reasonably
deems necessary to complete the Initial Listing on the recognized international securities exchange or
exchanges selected by the General Partner, including without limitation a restructuring or reorganization
or other transaction or asset transfer between or among KUE and any of its subsidiaries. If the Initial
Listing involves the listing of shares or other interests of a subsidiary of KUE, in the General Partner's
discretion, KUE may (i} retain some or all of KUE’s interest in such subsidiary not sold in connection with
the Initial Listing, (ii) distribute some or all of KUE’s interest in such subsidiary not sold in connection with
the Initial Listing to the Partners, (iii) offer Partners the opportunity to exchange their Common LP Units
and shares of the General Pariner for interests in such subsidiary, (iv) require Partners to exchange their
Common LP Units and shares of the General Partner for interests in such subsidiary, or (v) any
combination of the foregoing. Each Partner shall cooperate with the General Partner in connection with
the foregoing, including, without limitation, (i) by providing any necessary approvals from such Partner for
(a) any merger or consolidation of KUE or a subsidiary then permitted by law into an entity that is eligible
to effect such Initial Listing and has no other material business, assets or liabilities, or (b) a transfer of all,
substantially all or a portion of the assets and liabilities of KUE to one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries
eligible to effect the Initial Listing; (ii} by exchanging such Partner's Common LP Units and shares of the
General Partner for shares or other interests of the entity to be listed; (iii) by agreeing to customary “lock-
up” (on terms no more restrictive than KUE LLC or its affiliates or any other Common Limited Partner
which provides a “lock-up) and other agreements with underwriters; and (iv} by taking such other actions
as may be reasonably requested by the General Partner, provided that, in connection with such Initial
Listing, no Partner shall be required to contribute additional capital to KUE or the entity effecting the Initial
Listing. The economic interests of the Profits Participation Limited Partner shall not be reduced as a result
of any actions taken fo effect the Initial Listing.

The Class B Shares will automatically convert to Class A Shares if the Principals' aggregate economic
interest in KUE is less than 15% of the outstanding Partnership Units.

importantly, it requires a collective decision by public officials of all political stripes to agree to
stop running as defenders of the faith and to end the contest over who is more religious or
committed to “faith.” Religion and faith, as Jefferson recognized, are private matters and no one
should be judged based on their “religious opinions, any more than [their] opinions in physics or
geometry.” With this in mind, let me end this chapter with my own “Ten Commendments” (a
commandment is a cross between a “commandment” and an “amendment” that I would
“commend” candidates for following:

1. Do not claim God as a member of your party or that God is on your side of an issue.

2. Do not publicly proclaim your religious devotion, affiliation, and practices, or attack
those of your opponents.

3. Do not denounce those who differ with you about the proper role of religion in public
life as antireligious or intolerant of religion.

4. Do not surround your political campaign with religious trappings or symbols.

5. Honor and respect the diversity of this country, recalling that many Americans came to
these shores to escape the tyranny of enforced religious uniformity and, more recently,
enforced antireligious uniformity.

6. Do not seek the support of religious leaders who impose religious obligations on
members of their faith to support or oppose particular candidates.

7. Do not accuse those who reject formal religion of immorality. Recall that some of our
nation’s greatest leaders did not accept formal or even informal religion.

8. Do not equate morality and religion. Although some great moral teachers were
religious, some great moral sinners also acted in the name of religion.

9. When there are political as well as religious dimensions to an issue, focus on the
political ones during the campaign.

10. Remember that every belief is in a minority somewhere, and act as if your belief were
the least popular.

dream team of attorneys that included Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Ken Starr, [Alan Dershowitz]

being used as a means to government-sponsored sexual blackmail and other forms of leverage.

Trump Hands China an Easy
Win in the Trade War

The president's tough rhetoric plays into Chinese economic
nationalism.

By Kevin Rudd

Mr. Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is the president of the Asia Society Policy
Institute.

May 29, 2019

When President Trump tweeted on May 5 that the China trade deal was off, the historical echoes
in Beijing were loud and clear. Almost exactly 100 years earlier, China’s “May Fourth Movement”
of 1919 was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War
I. Wilson had promised China, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be
returned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to Japan. China exploded with anti-
American, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the
Chinese Communist Party, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country.

Thus, Mr. Trump has handed Xi Jinping a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time
when he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is
now full of accounts of the country’s economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking
the spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, China was able to stare
down the vastly superior American military.

And just in case people didn’t get the point, Mr. Xi recently visited Jiangxi, the starting point of
the Long March in 1934, in which the Communist Party endured many hardships but ultimately
emerged victorious.

I can almost hear members of the Trump administration groaning. Why on earth would they need
to take into consideration events in China’s ancient past?

The answer depends on what Mr. Trump’s primary objective is. If it’s to sound tough to American
voters, he may well have a winning formula. But if it’s to bring about a substantive change in
China’s negotiating posture toward a bilateral trade agreement, one that might usher in changes
in China’s trade policy, addressing questions of forced technology transfers, intellectual property
theft, industrial subsidies, currency manipulation and a phalanx of other non-tariff barriers, I’m
not so sure.

"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010943.txt,"consumption must exclude any schooling or nurture already counted in that
investment. (Schooling counts as consumption.) Mill would have understood the
human capital concept, defined by Sir William Petty nearly two centuries before, but
economists only recently have begun to take it seriously. Mill’s meaning of the

Y =C +I equation, and the one accepted everywhere in macroeconomics even today,

leaves out the growth in human capital and includes all consumption.

That equation, which | will try to prove correct if we make the two adjustments,
shows that less consumption brings faster growth if output holds still. But nothing
in the equation says it will. It says that less consumption means either more growth
or less output. It doesn’t say which. John Maynard Keynes, probably the most
famous and influential economist of the 20 century, put this fact of math a special
way in his General Theory of 1936. In his analysis, saving through less consumption
is either invested or not. Since output is consumption plus investment, saving
uninvested is so much less output. I like to put the same idea with a range of degrees.
All saving is invested, as I use the word, but finds different returns. Saving under the
mattress is investment at zero return, and drops output just as Keynes said.
Investment at the current average return keeps output unchanged. That’s what
Keynes meant. But investment at lower returns lowers output, and conversely.
Keynes’ version sees intended saving (consumption restraint) as either invested or
not, and sees it as translated dollar for dollar into actual capital growth if it is. Mine
allows any degree of capital growth below or above the actual cost of investment in

consumption given up.

This is a surprising concept, either in Keynes’ version or mine, because it seems to
fight personal experience. Until the next raise or job change or layoff, our incomes
seem to be known quantities. If we skip desert, and watch TV instead of going to the
movies, we can put more in the bank. At least our incomes will not drop because we
saved those costs. But it is different for all of us collectively. When the whole nation
saves, and either does not invest or invests less productively, output drops. Keynes’

analysis says the same, but leaves out the “less productively”.

including the hacking culture. Ex-hackers who lacked (or shunned)
employment opportunities in the corporate sector were suitable
candidates for the system administrator jobs that these firms had
contracted to supply the NSA. In the rush to expand, little heed was
paid to the 1996 warning that this hacking culture might provide
a portal to anti-government hacktivist groups. The NSA became
so enamored with this new computer technology that it neglected
the security implications of employing outsiders to service it. “All
of us just fell in love with the ease and convenience and scale [of
electronic storage],” General Hayden, who headed the NSA at the
time, said to The Wall Street Journal in 2015. “So we decided to take
things we used to keep if not in a safe, at least in our desk drawer,
and put it up here [in a computer network], where it’s by definition
more vulnerable.” Making matters even worse, as has previously
been discussed, the NSA stripped away much of the so-called stove-
piping that insulated highly sensitive data from the NSA’s other
computer networks. FBI Director Mueller, in his “Statement Before
the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental

© Affairs,”described a decade of post—9/11 intelligence reorganization ©
thus: “One of the first steps was to centralize control and manage-
ment of counterterrorism operations at headquarters to avoid the
‘stove-piping’ of information on terrorism cases in the 56 individual
field offices across the country.” Here the NSA was merely following
the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission to make their data
more accessible to other agencies concerned with potential terrorist
attacks, but as a result, the inner sanctum of the NSA became more
open to its new army of civilian technicians.

By 2013, much of the job of managing the NSA’s classified com-
puters had been handed over to a handful of private companies: Booz
Allen Hamilton, which handled the most highly secret work; Dell
SecureWorks; Microsoft; Raytheon; and IBM. In many respects,
these five companies acted less like management consultants and
more like temporary employment agencies in finding for the NSA
the computer specialists who had the necessary security clearances.

The NSA found that the universe of independent contractors was
governed by very different considerations from that of intelligence
services. Unlike intelligence services, their fate depended on turning

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014023.txt,"After my trip, I told my friend that I needed to dedicate all my energies to developing a method of
receiving income from U.S. citizens while living elsewhere. VOIP had recently been introduced to the
marketplace and Internet service was improving in South America and other parts of the third world.

The business had to be based upon absolute mobility. I boiled the whole business down to two basic
functions: reliable telephone via VOIP and high-speed Internet.

At the time I had a small research consultation practice where I was helping doctoral students on the
phone and via e-mail to complete their dissertations, theses, and statistical analyses. I had a small
website that was getting traffic but I was relying on others for web and marketing services. I
subsequently learned more about search engine optimization and web marketing and eventually took
control of all web marketing and promotion of my website, http://www.ResearchConsultation.com,
allowing me to expand my business substantially.

During the next three years I conducted numerous “mobile tests” ... traveling to Costa Rica, the
Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Colombia in order to fine-tune my system of conducting business
from abroad.

I finally left my job last November, the day before Thanksgiving, vowing to never return to the
mundane 9-to-5 structure. My job had even recently instituted a “bio-metric fingerprint” identification
system where you had to “punch in and out” at the beginning and end of your hospital shift with your
fingerprint to ensure that you were working your eight hours. This was just another sign that I had to
leave.

I now live in NYC and Colombia and travel to other parts of the world throughout the year: speaking
to customers, managing my contractors (U.S. and Colombian) in order to acquire U.S. dollars while
living for a fraction of the cost abroad. I’m also developing other websites and businesses (community
forums) that will hopefully be more automated, requiring less day-to-day interaction and monitoring.

Well, that’s my story for now ... today South America, tomorrow anywhere I can get a high-speed
connection (banda ancha)! My stress level has dropped significantly since leaving my old job and my
quality of life has improved enormously.

My family and friends in NYC still think ’'m out of my mind, and I continue to fully agree with
them.... —JEFF B.

THE 4-HOUR FAMILY AND GLOBAL EDUCATION
Tim,
We moved to a totally digital nomadic life traveling the world as a family in 2006, so we discovered

your book and ideas after we had begun and loved it! Our life has changed totally and is more fulfilling
and much more simple. We are greener, leaner, healthier, happier, more connected.

Other people thought we were absolutely nuts when we decided to do this in 2004/5, but now many of
those same people think we are smart and psychic.

Problems finding a good school fit (despite having many award-winning excellent ones at our
disposal) was probably the most specific moment (John Taylor Gatto says it best on why schools do not
educate) that helped us to change as well as wanting more time together and forecasting the
house/economy crash coming.

I think more families will be taking mini-retirements and living slower, traveling digital nomadic lives.
If you are away for months as a family, you need to be informed about all the wonderful educational
opportunities which are actually richer than staying home (which few realize)!

There are a TON of fantastic resources like Classroom 2.0 and many innovative educators online. My
daughter just turned eight and is having a blast with her online course with John Hopkins
University/CTY and it is also a nice resource for friends. Today one can immerse deeply in one culture

Things I’ve Loved and Learned in 2008

Dos was one of the most exciting years of my life. I did more dealmaking and met more people than

in the last five years combined. This produced many surprise insights about business and human nature,
especially as I uncovered dozens of my own false assumptions.

Here are some of the things I learned and loved in 2008.

Favorite reads of 2008: Zorba the Greek and Seneca: Letters from a Stoic. These are two of the most
readable books of practical philosophies ve ever had the fortune to encounter. If you have to choose
one, get Zorba, but Lucius Seneca will take you further. Both are fast reads of 2-3 evenings.

Don’t accept large or costly favors from strangers. This karmic debt will come back to haunt you. If
you can’t pass it up, immediately return to karmic neutrality with a gift of your choosing. Repay it before
they set the terms for you. Exceptions: tiber-successful mentors who are making introductions and not
laboring on your behalf.

You don’t have to recoup losses the same way you lose them. I own a home in San Jose but moved
almost 12 months ago. It’s been empty since, and I’m paying a large mortgage each month. The best
part? I don’t care. But this wasn’t always the case. For many months, I felt demoralized as others
pressured me to rent it, emphasizing how I was just flushing money away otherwise. Then I realized:
You don’t have to make money back the same way you lose it. If you lose $1,000 at the blackjack table,
should you try and recoup it there? Of course not. I don’t want to deal with renters, even with a property
management company. The solution: Leave the house alone, use it on occasion, and just create incoming
revenue elsewhere that would cover the cost of the mortgage through consulting, publishing, etc.

One of the most universal causes of self-doubt and depression: trying to impress people you don’t
like. Stressing to impress is fine, but do it for the right people—those you want to emulate.

Intelligence Agency that the military files compromised by Snowden included documents bearing
on military plans and weapons systems; foreign government’s intelligence activities (including
special activities), intelligence sources, or methods or cryptology;

Scientific and technological matters relating to national security;; vulnerabilities systems,
installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relations to national security
and the development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction. The members of the
House and Senate Intelligence Committees, but not the public, also have been privy to an NSA
investigation that established the chronology of his actions, including changing jobs, copying more
than one million classified documents at the Signals Intelligence Center in Hawaii and flying to
Russia.

Nor does additional information necessarily change the minds of people who already have a
firm view. In the field of social psychology, the testing of “confirmation theory” consistently
shows that people tend to more readily reject new information that contradicts their pre-existing
beliefs. For example, when Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested in the Texas Theater on November
22, 1963, he said famously, “I haven’t shot anybody.” Ten months later, the Warren Commission
presented evidence, including ballistic tests that it claamed showed that Oswald had shot three
people, including President John F. Kennedy, less than an hour before making his statement. Yet,
many of those who believed Oswald’s public proclamation his innocence chose to believe that the
government had falsified all the incriminating evidence to tarnish Oswald (who had been killed on
November 24, 1963) rather than accept that they had been wrong in believing Oswald.

The charges, countercharges and defamatory name-calling in the Snowden case therefore only
deepened the great divide. Those who saw Snowden as a democratic hero exposing the abuses of
power of an out-of-control national security state tended to dismiss anything that depicts
Snowden in a negative light as a fabrication while those who saw Snowden as a “traitor” tended
to dismiss anything that depicted him in a more positive light.

When it comes to the murky universe of spy agencies, the problem in deciding where the truth
lies is further heightened by the possibility of deliberate deception. Spy masters are, after all, in
the business of concealing their most sensitive operations. It is often considered essential that
important secrets be protected by what Winston Churchill famously termed “a bodyguard of lies.”
Top intelligence officials are not exempt from this practice. Consider, for example, the response
to a question concerning the NSA’s operations made by James D. Clapper, the Director of
National Intelligence to the Senate Intelligence Committee on March 12, 2013. Senator Ron
Wyden (D-Oregon) of the Committee asked the spy master if the NSA collected data on
Americans. Clapper answered that the NSA did not knowingly “collect any type of data” on
millions of Americans. Clapper’s answer was clearly untrue. However, it did not mislead Senator
Wyden or any other members of the Senate Intelligence Committee because Clapper had
truthfully testified that the NSA did collect American’s telephone records in a classified session of
the Committee earlier that week. Who was being misled was the American public. Yet, none of
the Senators on the Committee, including Senator Wyden, corrected this obviously false answer.
When Clapper realized he had misspoken, he could not publically correct the record of the public

Re Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been a lot of 
focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we hear from 
management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. 
This morning the pricing is as follows: 
Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10 
Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90 
Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept puts. 
However I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management before August expiry.

Smiles
When we smile naturally we use a full set of facial muscles, including the
muscles around our eyes. When the smile is forced those eye muscles
remain passive and the smile, although superficially the same, is missing
something. You can’t put your finger on it, but the look is insincere. A
study of marriages in the USA analyzed smiles in wedding photographs.
The couples with false smiles divorced much earlier than the genuinely
happy couples. Similarly for high school photos; people with genuine
smiles at 18 years of age were happier later in life and in more stable
relationships. Smiling is really important. It is good to be around people
who smile, they are more successful — and nicer.

There is also a curious reverse effect. The link between our minds
and bodies is much more fundamental than we thought. If you grasp a
pencil between your teeth, it forces you to smile. Try it. The mere act
of smiling is found to make you happier, it causes the release of the
chemicals called endorphins which improve your feeling of well-being.

Micro-expression Analysis

Since the involuntary movements of the muscles around our eyes give
away genuine happiness, a whole science has evolved looking for other
biological cues to mood. The two most interested groups are the FBI,
trying to detect lies, and poker players, trying to make money! Much has
been written on the topic, including a few best sellers, but the evidence
for micro expressions is mixed. Regardless of whether involuntary
actions give away our emotions, humans voluntarily use a great deal of
body language when talking.

Body Language

A study by Albert Mehrabian is often cited to say 93% of the information
in a conversation comes through nonverbal cues. This is misquoted.
The study really stated 93% of the emotional content is nonverbal.
That's more believable. And further studies have shown when there is
doubt, nonverbal cues win over verbal information every time. The rule
is sometimes laid out as the 7%-38%-55% rule — 7% words, 38% tone
of voice and 55% body language. Remember this is emotional content,
your conviction and sincerity. You will still have to get over the factual
information you want to convey.

Now, I don't leap from the Oval Office on a Saturday afternoon to Auschwitz, but there
are similarities when the rule of law doesn't obtain, or where you have one law for the
powerful and one for the nonaristocratic.

He did not give me an opportunity to respond to his absurd invocation of Auschwitz. But I did
insist on responding when Congressman Barr contrasted me with the “real America” and how
“the real America views these matters.” The following heated exchange then took place:

MR. DERSHOWITZ: Can I respond, 30 seconds, to what I perceive to have been a
personal attack? First of all, whenever I hear the word real Americans, that sounds to
me like a codeword for racism -- a code word for bigotry, a codeword --

REP. BARR: That's absurd, professor, you ought to be ashamed. That is the silliest thing
I have ever heard --

MR. DERSHOWITZ: When I hear you describe me as something other than a real
American -- shame on you. We may have a disagreement about the merits of these issues,
but I would no more impugn your Americanism than you should impugn mine, sir.

REP. BARR: You're being silly, professor. You are being absolutely silly.
MR. HIGGINBOTHAM: May I respond, Mr. Chairman?

REP. HYDE: Yes, indeed -- far be it from me to not have anyone respond. Go right
ahead.

MR. HIGGINBOTHAM: I take profound disagreement with Congressman Barr's
categorization of the real America, which he apparently understands with such fine
discernment, and those of us who teach at universities are oblivious. You know we have
students, and they teach us something. And my father was a laborer. My mother was a
domestic. And I climbed up the ladder, and I did not come to where I am through some
magical wand. So t hat I am willing to match you any hour any day in terms of the
perception of the real American.

Not all the Congressmen were angered by my aggressive testimony. This is how Congressman
Rogan summarized his views:

I guess, in fairness, Professor Dershowitz, I have to single you out just for one moment,
because I want to assure you that you and I have no hard feelings between ourselves. I
know that you raised a few hackles here with some of my colleagues with controversial
comments, but I want you to know I personally found them to be very therapeutic,
because up till now the only excuse I had for not having attended Harvard Law School
was my grade-point average. (Laughter.) So you've given me a little different perspective.

Following my testimony, I worked closely with the president’s legal team both on the
impeachment and on the Starr investigation. One summer day, during the impeachment crisis, the

of Yanta, across from Jobb Jannine.

But as it was making its way there, we got word a cease-fire had been
agreed. It was set for noon the next day, Friday, June 11. The main focus of our
advance shifted to a crossroads a few miles east of Jobb Janine. It was a flat,
open area surrounded by hills, codenamed the Tovlano Triangle on our maps.
We knew we would meet some Syrian resistance. On the way up the valley,
we'd seen signs of reinforcements from inside Syria. But we had overwhelming
superiority in tanks, artillery and infantry in the area, as well as full control of
the air. In our command post, about five miles back from our frontline forces,
Yanoush set in motion the plan for a pre-cease-fire advance to take the hills
overlooking the Tovlano Triangle. It was still about eight miles short of the
Beirut-Damascus road. But the idea was to establish a more secure defensive
position by the time the truce took effect, and to put us in position to advance
further if the cease-fire collapsed or was delayed.

Shortly before sunset, Yanoush left by helicopter for a field commanders’
meeting with Raful in northern Israel. That left me in charge, alongside
Yanoush’s de facto chief-of-staff, Amram Mitzna. A decorated veteran of 1967
and 1973 whom I knew well, Amram had the added distinction of being disliked
by Raful almost as much as I was. Our main reserve division had been ordered
to take control over the hills south of the Tovlano Triangle. One of its brigades,
led by a former Sayeret Matkal soldier named Nachman Rifkind, was sent to
take up a position immediately south of the triangle. Soon after nightfall,
Rifkind radioed in that he was there, and that the area seemed clear of enemy
forces. The divisional command post then ordered a second brigade to move
toward the hills dominating the crossroads.

The first sign of trouble came around midnight. From our overall command
post, we were listening in on all radio traffic, and heard the second brigade
report that it had come under fire while moving toward the crossroads. At first,
we assumed it must be from the remnants of a retreating Syrian unit. But
Rifkind, who had reported the area was clear, now said that he could see flashes
of shellfire two or three miles to his north. Only the following morning did it
become clear that he had not deployed immediately south of the triangle as
planned. He had mistakenly halted at a hill about two miles short of there.

By the time Yanoush returned to the command post a little after midnight,
we were facing another problem. The battalion nearest to the south of the
triangle had spotted a dozen large vehicles armed with missiles a few hundred

IMAGES-012-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033417.txt,"In the years after the First World War, until the end of the Second World War, three political models for shaping the future of
nation states emerged; Fascism, Communism and liberal democracy. These all offered great ideas for the future of the world.
Fascism and Communism shared some common features: authoritarian, strong leaders and a belief that their revolutions had
to be carried through with violence. This led to the mass murders in the Nazi concentration camps and 1n the Soviet Gulags.

In the mid war periods, the “Litfass columns” that were originally designed to carry advertising, became the outdoor galleries
for the war of ideologies. The political poster was born. High quality posters from every political party in Germany popped
up on the columns. Hitler’s propaganda chief Géebels stated that the Nazi election campaign should be run through speeches
and posters. The other parties responded in kind. An art form thus became an essential political tool in the battle for votes.
The propagandist Art used by the Nazis and communists alike was essential in helping sell their message to the masses.
Indeed, much of the art that was critical of these movements was suppressed or censored and “subversive” artists cowed, in
some cases imprisoned or even worse.

The liberal democratic model departed sharply from these authoritarian perspectives by presenting the alternative of free and
transparent elections, the rule of law and freedom of speech. In the mid-war period the three narratives were competing to be
the conceptual frame for society. After the Second World War fascism was crushed leaving the two competing ideologies of
communism and liberal democracy. After the demise of communism in 1989, through to the late 1990’s, liberal democracy
was victorious 1n the idealogical battlefield. Some historians, like Francis Fukuyama, went so far as to proclaim this period as
“the end of history”.

A key piece of art that championed this kind of ideology was Sheppard Fairey’s campaign poster for Barack Obama. In this
poster, Fairey, a well established graffiti artist uses urban colours and stencilling techniques combined with the message
“HOPE” to promote the incoming presidents positive values and popularity with the young. It 1s notable that Fairey’s most
recent political poster protests the Trump presidency rather than promote it.

With the rise of so called “illiberal democracy”, with strong parties standing for populist ideologies, we have now moved into
what can be described as the age of bewilderment. We were not in fact at the “end of history”. Once again the future looks
unpredictable and insecure and artists are responding in different ways.

Jeremy Deller, a British Turner prize winning artist created a work which features a car damaged in the bombing of the
historic Mutanabbi Street book market, which resulted in the deaths of 38 people. Here, an art work has been used to show the
aftermath of an event. This event was the result of the Iraq war, which was seen as a way to spread democracy. Here Art 1s
used as a means by which to explore the effects of ideology rather than promote it, another really interesting area in the study
of the intersections between ideology and art.

Exploring how art reflects the historical and ideological contexts of the world around it is fascinating to me and I would love
to study these ideas in more depth at undergraduate level.

something from the signals it receives. This is similar to our engineer
probing the terminals of the circuit of a black box. How can we know our
experience of the world is real?

Understanding the World

The French philosopher Descartes gave us an explanation for this
paradox. He spent a long time looking skeptically at everything we
perceive. For example, when we poke a stick into a pond, the surface of
the water bends light and the stick appears to have a kink in it. Our eyes
tell us the stick is bent, but our brain ‘knows’ the stick is straight: it’s an
illusion. Descartes wondered if something so simple could be an illusion,
perhaps the whole of our experience is too.

His eventual solution underpins much of modern philosophy - ‘T
think therefore I am, cogito ergo sum. Even if we doubt everything else,
we cannot doubt we are thinking about this doubt. At least we can rely
upon the existence of this ‘thought’ as some reality. Descartes built up
from this bedrock the real world we live in. We can be sure we experience
things and can apply logic and use thought. We can use this intellectual
faculty to tell a great deal about our Universe.

True Understanding

In the QED lecture series, The Strange Thing about Light and Matter,
Richard Feynman relates the story of the ancient Mayan astronomers.
3000 years ago they were able to predict the motion of Venus in the sky
using only pebbles. They had a simple system that could predict when
the planet would rise over the horizon. Put a stone in the jar every day,
take out a stone once a week, add a stone at every new moon. If the
number of stones in the jar is divisible by 23, Venus will rise. ’m making
up the details but you see the idea... It’s a very simple algorithm. What
should we conclude if the Mayans had perfected their calculations to
predict the motion of Venus and it proved reliable over a whole century?
Would this constitute understanding?

Feynman would say no: the Mayan understanding was not
complete. It was only black box equivalent to our modern understanding
over a limited period. We known that once the Sun begins to run out
of fuel it will swell to a red giant and explode, destroying Venus and
the Earth. Their model could not predict this catastrophic failure. Our
modern deeper understanding of the workings of the solar system allows

now found an unbalanced woman who has delusions of having sex tapes of Donald Trump,
Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and other prominent figures,” Dershowitz said in a tweet.

Boies, best known for arguing on behalf of Vice President Al Gore in the 2000 Florida election
recount, responded in an interview with the Herald:

“[Dershowitz’s] charges are absurd. Either he has become totally unhinged or he thinks that if
he says things that are loud enough and crazy enough it will distract attention from what he has
done. There is no support — none — for what he says.”

Ransome claimed that, in her early 20s, she was recruited to work as a masseuse for Epstein
who, in exchange, promised he would help her get into fashion design in New York, according to
her civil lawsuit, filed in January 2017. Epstein and Maxwell then kept her passport and
threatened to ruin her life and physically harm her if she didn’t have sex with them and others
in 2006 and 2007, Ransome said in the complaint.

The complaint alleges that this all occurred at the same time as Epstein’s lawyers were
negotiating with Acosta and other federal prosecutors for a deal to avoid federal sex trafficking
charges in connection with a scheme in which he lured underprivileged girls, mostly 13 to 16, to
his home in Palm Beach under the pretense that he would pay them $200 to $300 for massages.
Instead, police in Palm Beach found that he had been molesting and sexually abusing dozens of
girls between 2001 and 2007.

In this photograph, Virginia Roberts socializes with Prince Andrew as Jeffrey
Epstein associate Guislaine Maxwell stands in the background. Roberts claims she
was effectively used as a sex slave by Epstein. In that capacity she had sex with
the prince, Roberts says. The prince denied that. COURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS

Under the plea deal, known as a non-prosecution agreement, Epstein was allowed to plead
guilty in state court to two prostitution charges. He served 13 months in a private wing of the
Palm Beach County jail, where he was given liberal work release privileges. The deal also
quashed an FBI investigation into whether Epstein was operating an international sex
trafficking organization, the Herald found as part of its yearlong investigation.

“Even as [Epstein, Maxwell and other defendants] and their attorneys were busy arguing
Epstein’s innocence and publicly defaming his victims as liars...defendants merely changed

true, Woody’s actions would demonstrate extreme insensitivity to Mia Farrow’s family. Here is
how the appellate court ultimately characterized Woody’s behavior.

“In January of 1992, Mr. Allen took the photographs of Ms. Previn [Soon Yi] which were
discovered on the mantelpiece in his apartment by Ms. Farrow and were introduced into
evidence...Mr. Allen in his trial testimony stated that he took the photos at Ms. Previn's
suggestion and that he considered them erotic and not pornographic. We have viewed the
photographs and do not share Mr. Allen's characterization of them. We find the fact that
Mr. Allen took them at a time when he was formally assuming a legal responsibility for
two of Ms. Previn's siblings to be totally unacceptable. The distinction Mr. Allen makes
between Ms. Farrow's other children and Dylan, Satchel and Moses is lost on this Court.
The children themselves do not draw the same distinction that Mr. Allen does. This is
sadly demonstrated by the profound effect his relationship with Ms. Previn has had on the
entire family. Allen's testimony that the photographs of Ms. Previn “... were taken, as I
said before, between two consenting adults wanting to do this ...” demonstrates a chosen
ignorance of his and Ms. Previn's relationships to Ms. Farrow, his three children and Ms.
Previn's other siblings. His continuation of the relationship, viewed in the best possible
light, shows a distinct absence of judgment. It demonstrates to this Court Mr. Allen's
tendency to place inappropriate emphasis on his own wants and needs and to minimize and
even ignore those of his children. At the very minimum, it demonstrates an absence of any
parenting skills.”

Mia asked me to call Woody and tell him to stop doing what he was doing. She told me that
Woody admired me and that he kept a copy of my book Chutzpah on his bed table.

I asked Mia to have Woody call me but he apparently refused so I decided to write him a letter,
which I asked his lawyer to give him. In the letter, I urged Woody to try to resolve the matter
privately:

“T still believe that matter can be resolved without even more escalation and damage to all
parties. As you and Mia both know, I am a great admirer of your work, and I do not want
to see your career and your life destroyed. Right now you are on that road and something
must be done to head it off, not only for your sake, but for the sake of the children and for
Mia.”

I don’t know whether he ever got the letter. I received no reply. Mia then asked me to contact
his lawyers and see if the matter could be resolved without any public disclosure. I said I would
try. I called his lawyers and they agreed to a meeting in New York. I brought with me to the
meeting a law school classmate, David Levett, who was a leading lawyer in Connecticut and was
knowledgeable about the Connecticut law relating to such issues. Our goal, and Mia’s, was to
bring about some resolution of this troubling matter without any publicity, which she felt would
be harmful to her children.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028053.txt,"Though no one claimed responsibility, there was no shortage of suspects.
During and since the civil war, Gemayel had at various times been at odds with
a whole array of enemies or rivals: Muslim militias, the PLO, other Maronite
factions and, of course, the Syrians. But I think for all of us, even Arik, the issue
of who was behind the bombing was hardly the most urgent concern. The
immediate danger was a revival of the kind of rampant bloodletting Lebanon
had endured in the civil war. The day after the assassination, I joined a half-
dozen other members of the general staff and helicoptered up to the Lebanese
capital. Arik, ignoring weeks of US pressure not to do so, had already ordered
Israeli troops into west Beirut — not to fight, but to take control of key junctions
and vantage points and keep basic order.

But the question obviously on everyone’s mind was how to make sure the
situation remained under control. It was early afternoon when we reached an
Israeli command post in the largely Palestinian southwest part of the city. It was
set up by Amos Yaron, the former paratroop commander whose division had
landed by sea at the start of the invasion and was part of the push north to the
capital. At his side was Amir Drori, the head of the northern command. They
had set up a rooftop observation post just a few hundred yards in from where I
had landed with my Sayeret Matkal team a decade earlier for the Rue Verdun
operation. It overlooked a pair of Palestinian refugee camps: Sabra and, a
couple of hundred yards closer to us, Shatila.

Raful was with us as well. So was Moshe Levy, the deputy chief-of-staff,
and Uri Saguy, the head of the operations branch in the kirya. I listened rather
than spoke. All I could gather from the other generals’ conversation was that
they were trying to figure out how to handle the Palestinian camps. No one
explicitly mentioned the idea of Israeli troops going in, presumably because
they realized that, far from helping ensure order, that might well inflame things
further. Even Raful, at least in my earshot, made no reference to the “several
thousand” PLO fighters that he and Arik still wanted out of Beirut. The only
note that struck me as odd was a general agreement that the Phalangists had not
been carrying their load of the fighting during the war. One comment in
particular stuck with me, though I didn’t take it as referring to the Palestinian
camps in particular. I can’t remember which general said it, only that everyone
seemed to agree: “Why the hell do we have to do their fighting for them?”

It was not until the next morning, back in Tel Aviv, that the alarm bells rang
for me, and by then it turned out to be too late. It was Friday, the eve of the
Jewish New Year. Yet in the wake of Gemayel’s assassination, the kirya was

history dating back to the era of the czars, Russian intelligence had
perfected the technique of false flag recruitment, through which it
assumes an identity to fit the ideological bent of a potential recruit.

Russian intelligence was well experienced with false flags. It first
used this technique following the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 to
control dissidents both at home and abroad. The centerpiece, as later
analyzed by the CIA, was known as the “Trust” deception. It began
in August 1921 when a high-ranking official of the Communist
regime in Russia named Aleksandr Yakushev slipped away from a
Soviet trade delegation in Estonia and sought out a leading anti-
Communist exile he had known before the revolution in Russia. He
then told him that he represented a group of disillusioned officials in
Russia that included key members of the secret police, the army, and
the Interior Ministry. Yakushev said that they all had come to the
same conclusion: the Communist experiment in Russia had totally
failed and needed to be replaced. To effect this regime change, they
had formed an underground organization code-named the Trust,
because the cover for their conspiratorial activities was the Moscow

© headquarters of the Municipal Credit Association, which was a trust ©
company. According to Yakushev’s account, it had become the equiv-
alent of a de facto government by 1921.

The exiled leader in Estonia reported this astonishing news to
British intelligence, which, along with French and American intel-
ligence, helped fund this newly emerged anti-Communist group.
Initially, British intelligence had doubts about the bona fides of the
Trust, as did other Western intelligence services sponsoring exile
groups. But they gradually accepted it after they received intelli-
gence reports confirming its operations from many other sources,
including Russian officials, diplomats, and military officers who
claimed to have defected from the Soviet government. Because these
reports all dovetailed, they recognized the Trust as a legitimately
underground organization.

Once the Trust had been established in the minds of the West-
ern intelligence services, it offered them as well as exile groups the
services of its network of collaborators. These services included
smuggling out dissidents, stealing secret documents, and disbursing
money inside Russia to sympathizers. Within a year, exile groups in

KING’S CROSS , LONDON

I stumbled into the deli across the cobblestone street and ordered a prosciutto sandwich. It was 10:33
A.M. now, the fifth time I’d checked the time, and the twentieth time I’d asked myself, “What the & %$#
am I going to do today?”

The best answer I had come up with so far was: get a sandwich.

Thirty minutes earlier, I had woken up without an alarm clock for the first time in four years, fresh off
arriving from JFK the night before. I had soooo been looking forward to it: awakening to musical
birdsong outside, sitting up in bed with a smile, smelling the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and
stretching out overhead like a cat in the shade of a Spanish villa. Magnificent. It turned out more like
this: bolt upright as if blasted with a foghorn, grab clock, curse, jump out of bed in underwear to check
e-mail, remember that I was forbidden to do so, curse again, look for my host and former classmate,
realize that he was off to work like the rest of the world, and proceed to have a panic attack.

I spent the rest of the day in a haze, wandering from museum to botanical garden to museum as if on
rinse and repeat, avoiding Internet cafés with some vague sense of guilt. I needed a to-do list to feel
productive and so put down things like “eat dinner.”

This was going to be a lot harder than I had thought.

Cheap and Out of Control along with a lion-tamer, a topiarist, and an expert on the
naked mole rat, was described by one reviewer as “smiling with a wild gleam in his eye.’
But that’s pretty much true of most visionaries.

A few years later in his career, Brooks, as befits one of the world’s leading
roboticists, suggested that “we overanthropomorphize humans, who are after all mere
machines.” He went on to present a warm-hearted vision of a coming Al world in which
“the distinction between us and robots is going to disappear.” He also admitted to
something of a divided worldview. “Like a religious scientist, I maintain two sets of
inconsistent beliefs and act on each of them in different circumstances,” he wrote. “It is
this transcendence between belief systems that I think will be what enables mankind to
ultimately accept robots as emotional machines, and thereafter start to empathize with
them and attribute free will, respect, and ultimately rights to them.”

That was in 2002. In these pages, he takes a somewhat more jaundiced, albeit
narrower, view; he is alarmed by the extent to which we have come to rely on pervasive

Bosphorus, past Istanbul, and on to Haifa on the Palestinian coast, from where
they were taken by truck to their bunk-bed rooms in one of a dozen prefab
structures on the recently established kibbutz. Though the water came from a
well, and it lacked even the basic creature comforts of the cramped Godin
apartment in Warsaw, that, to my mother, was just part of the challenge, and the
dream, she’d embraced and had come to define her. I know that she felt, on
arriving in the kibbutz, that only now was her life truly beginning.

It was a feeling that never left her. Yet it was always clouded by the memory
of the family she left behind. When the Second World War began in September
1939, the Germans, and then the Soviets, invaded, overran and divided Poland.
Two of my mother’s three sisters fled to Moscow. Her teenage brother Avraham
went underground, joining the anti-Nazi partisans. All three would survive the
war. Yet in the autumn of 1940, the rest of her family found themselves inside
the Warsaw Ghetto with the city’s other 400,000 Jews. My mother’s parents
died there, along with her 13-year-old brother Itzik and her little sister Henya,
who was only 11.

When my mother arrived in the kibbutz, her Gordonia friends assumed she
would marry a young man named Ya’akov Margalit, the leader of their group
back in Warsaw. But the budding romance fell victim to the Zionist cause. As
she was embarking on her new life, he was frequently back in Poland training
and arranging papers for further groups of pioneers. He continued to write her
long, heartfelt letters. But the letters had to be brought from the central post
office in Tel Aviv, and the kibbutznik who fetched the mail was a quiet,
dimunitive 25-year-old named Yisrael Mendel Brog — my father. Known as
Srulik, his Yiddish nickname, he had come to Palestine five years earlier. He
was an ordinary kibbutz worker. He drove a tractor.

My father’s initial impulse in coming to Palestine was more personal than
political. He was born, in 1910, in the Jewish shtet/ of Pushelat in Lithuania,
near the larger Jewish town of Ponovezh, a major seat of rabbinic learning and
teaching. His own father, though the only member of the Pushelat community
with rabbinical training, made his living as the village pharmacist. Many of the
roughly 10,000 Jews who lived there had left for America in the great exodus
from Russian and Polish lands at the end of the 19 century. By the time my
father was born, the community had shrunk to only about 1,000. When he was
two years old, a fire broke out, destroying dozens of homes, as well as the
shtetl’s only synagogue. Donations soon arrived from the US, and my paternal

of age-wage profiles as we see them. Pay is all human depreciation at the end.

What I Thought Once

Chapter 6 will compare accounting for human capital to accounting for a firm. Pay,
in this analogy, is the worker’s revenue. The firm deducts outside operating costs of
labor and supplies to leave gross realized output. The analogy for human capital
would be maintenance consumption enabling life and activity. But I don’t deduct
this in reaching the workers’ gross realized output (gross realized work) because |
take it as part of the net output we intend in itself rather than a cost in return for
what we intend. I see adult consumption as mainly Schultz’ pure consumption
exhausted from the universe of capital, including human capital, in satisfying our

taste for adult survival.

Opinion is divided here. Some economists have treated the maintenance
consumption that keeps workers going as new investment in human capital for the
sake of higher pay in future. Some in the 18 century expensed it, like maintenance
in the firm, as a cost recovered in keeping up the worker’s revenue (pay) now,
rather than invested for later. I did that for years. I now treat it as recovered neither
in pay now nor pay later. Even though we couldn’t earn without it, | count it in pure

consumption exhausted in satisfying tastes for survival.

When! thought it was recovered in pay and work products, up to about five years
ago, I realized that human depreciation could not also be. There would be nothing
left for pure consumption except Mill's “unproductive consumption” neither
replacing nor maintaining human capital. That would stand biology on its head.
Biology is precisely about replacing and maintaining us. Unproductive consumption,
for which there seem to be parallels in other species, is something biology has yet to

justify. It cannot be the unique taste satisfaction that behavior reveals.

The rise and possible fall of the Assad dynasty would provide a
perfect illustration of the Khaldunian paradigm under recent
postcolonial conditions. Under Ottoman rule the Nusayris were
impoverished outsiders struggling on the social margins. In addition
to feuding among themselves, they were fierce rivals of the Ismailis,
whom they expelled from their highland refuges and castles, forcing
them to settle in the more arid lands east of Homs. The Ottoman
governors regarded them as nonbelievers and tools of the Shiite
Persians: they were not even accorded the dignity of a millet, or
recognized religious community.

When the French took over Greater Syria after World War I
(including modern Lebanon and parts of modern Turkey), they flirted
briefly with the idea of creating a highland Alawi state of 300,000
people separate from the cities of the plains—Homs, Hama,
Damascus, and Aleppo—with their dominant Sunni majorities. The
French rightly believed that the Sunni majority would be most
resistant to their rule. Like other minorities the Alawis, as they
preferred to be called, saw the French as protectors. In 1936, six
Alawi notables sent a memorandum to Leon Blum, head of France’s
Popular Front government, expressing their loyalty to France and
their concern at negotiations leading to independence in a
parliamentary system dominated by the Sunni majority. The
memorandum includes the following points:

¢ The Alawi people, who have preserved their independence year
after year with great zeal and sacrifices, are different from the Sunni
Muslims. They were never subject to the authority of the cities of the
interior.

¢ The Alawis refuse to be annexed to Muslim Syria because in Syria
the official religion of the state is Islam, and according to Islam the
Alawis are considered infidels.

victim, despite being ordered not to contact her, the court record shows.

Still, Hunt argued that a sentence of five years was overly harsh.

Villafafia disagreed, but conceded that McDaniel would benefit from psychological
treatment. She advocated for a sentence of five to sex years, which was at the low
end of the guideline.

It was then that the judge heard from the victim’s mother.

In a statement, the mother decried the emotional and mental trauma her daughter
suffered and the long road to recovery she had ahead of her. The mother mentioned
she was further upset that McDaniel continued contact with her daughter after his
arrest and she said she believed that McDaniel was still trying to manipulate her
daughter by blaming her for his arrest.

The mother pointed out that prior to their sexual encounter, McDaniel had directed
her daughter to watch sexually explicit movies and had described for her sex
activities he had had with another underage girl.

At that point, the judge interrupted.

“_.. [here has been some reference to another incident with a minor girl. What do
you know about that, if anything?” Zloch asked Villafana.

Former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta never told sexual-abuse victims of a lenient plea
deal for Jeffrey Epstein.

Only then did Zloch learn that McDaniel had preyed on other girls over the internet,
including a 16-year-old California girl whom he brought to Texas and impregnated.
He was also having another relationship with a 15-year-old girl at the time of his
arrest, Villafafa admitted in court.

The judge promptly sentenced McDaniel to 10 years — twice what Villafana
recommended.

Three months later, in January 2007, after reviewing the entire case, Zloch issued
an order excoriating Villafaiia for failing to tell him about McDaniel’s prior history.

“The serial nature of defendant’s seduction of minor girls was revealed for the first
time to the court upon the Government’s response to the Court’s inquiry,” Zloch

The same is true for Vice President Gore and his wife

Historically, the majority of k12’s revenue has been from virtual schools and district-managed virtual
programs. Traditionally, k12’s revenue growth has been driven by three major factors; (i) the addition of
grades, (ii) the addition of states and (iii) same-store growth in existing states.

In 2002 k12 began operations in two states (Colorado and Pennsylvania). In 2003 revenue grew to $30.9
million from $6.7 million during the 2002 fiscal year end. Growth was due to the addition of four new
states (Ohio, Idaho, California and Arkansas), three new grades and same store sales growth of
approximately 40%. During 2004 revenue increased by 131.0% to $71.4 million. Revenue growth during
the 2004 fiscal year was due to the addition of five new states (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin
and the District of Columbia) and two new grades. During the 2005 fiscal year k12 began to concentrate
on leveraging its scale to achieve profitability by slowing down curriculum production and not aggressively
pursuing new states. Revenue grew at a slower rate, but profitability increased as the growth in the
existing states continued. Existing state growth is more profitable than new state growth because each
new state requires a significant amount of fixed overhead to be added.

The projections of financial results presented above are based on the development and expansion of
k12’s operations in existing states and grades. Key growth drivers in the near term are expected to
include high same-store growth rates and k12's ability to leverage its existing infrastructure for margin
improvement. Future drivers of growth at k12 which are not included in the projections are expected to
include the addition of new states. In 2006, k12 opened in Texas, Wyoming and Washington. More
recently, the Chicago school board approved a virtual public school for the city of Chicago that will be
managed by k12. k12 also received a charter in the Sacramento area of California that will allow it to
serve a large area in California that it cannot currently serve. 12 is currently continuing to pursue
opportunities in several other states.

Under k12’s current revenue recognition policy, revenues are principally earned from contractual
agreements to provide on-line curriculum, books, materials, computers and to manage and operate virtual
charter schools. In most contracts, k12 is responsible to the charter schools for all aspects of the
management of schools, including but not limited to the monitoring of the academic achievement of the
students, training, and compensation of school personnel; and procurement of curriculum and equipment
necessary for operations of the schools. The schools receive funding on a per student basis from the
state in which the charter school or school district is located. Where k12 has determined that they are the
primary obligor for substantially all expenses under these contracts, k12 records the associated per
student revenue received by the school from its state funding school district up to the expenses incurred
in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal
Versus Net as an Agent. k12 has generally agreed to fund any operating losses of the schools in a given
school year; however, k12 is not entitled to any revenue in excess of expenses incurred on its contracts,

company’s books and records so that the company and its management
are aware of the payments and can assure that the payments were properly
made under the circumstances. For example, in one instance, a Kazakh
immigration prosecutor threatened to fine, jail, or deport employees

ofa US. company’s subsidiary. Believing the threats to be genuine, the
employees in Kazakhstan sought guidance from senior management

of the US. subsidiary and were authorized to make the payments. The
employees then paid the government official a total of $45,000 using
personal funds. The subsidiary reimbursed the employees, but it falsely
recorded the reimbursements as “salary advances” or “visa fines.” The
parent company, which eventually discovered these payments, as well

as other improperly booked cash payments made to a Kazakhstani

v i u u ws, but I’ve never experi i
I’ve been to many prisons and on numerous death rows, but I’ve never experienced so grim a
cae ww? wi ic mn ; Le
lace as this “life or death row,” where every inmate saw every other inmate as a competitor in
the quest to remain alive.

The warden invited me to play basketball with the inmates and I agreed. No one fouled me, trash-
talked me or in any way misbehaved, as the warden watched, notepad in hand. I was conscious
throughout the 30 minute game that anything a player did or didn’t do could become part of their
score of death—or life. I tried hard to make everyone look good in the eyes of the warden.

The changing consensus regarding human rights

By the mid-1970s, the consensus regarding human rights was beginning to change. Although the
Soviet Union had long used the language of “human rights” (as well as the language of “civil
rights”) as a club against western democracies, few serious people gave this hypocritical ploy any
credence. “There they go again” was the general response when Soviet diplomats at the United
Nations postured against the imperfections of the United States, while their Communist masters
locked up dissidents, made a mockery of justice,” and kept entire nations in subjugation behind an
iron curtain.

By the early 1970s, however, the Soviet ploy was beginning to be expropriated by the hard left in
the United States and Europe. Hard left intellectuals such as Professors Noam Chomsky of MIT
and Richard Falk of Princeton were claiming that the United States was the worst human rights
violator in the world.'°° Some hard left lawyers, such as William Kunstler, refused to say anything
critical of the human rights records of the Soviet Union, China, Cuba or other “socialist”
countries, while railing against the human rights violations of the United States and its allies. As I
previously mentioned, Angela Davis, who I had helped to represent in the early 1970s, refused to
speak up for Soviet dissidents and in fact supported Soviet repression of “fascist opponents of
socialist democracy,” i.e., dissidents and Refusenicks. Another client, Abby Hoffman, also turned
against me. I was part of the legal team in the Chicago Seven case that grew out of
demonstrations during the Democratic National Convention of 1968. Abby Hoffman, who was
one of the defendants, had allegedly made some crude remarks about how his “Jew lawyers”
cared more about Israel than America. I called him out on his comments in a brief note, to which
he responded with an angry handwritten two page letter which included the following:
“T never made a remark about my ‘Jewish Lawyers.’ I might have spoken more positively
about the PLO but I would never make an anti-Semitic juxtaposition such as you think
you heard. If you read my current autobiography you will see I flaunt my ‘Jewishness’ at
every turn of the road.”
At the time Hoffman penned these words, the PLO was a terrorist gang that was hijacking
airplanes, murdering civilians and blowing up synagogues, and Israel had not yet established any
settlements in occupied areas.

» An old Soviet dissident joke went this way: The leader of Czechoslovakia asked his Soviet masters for money
for a Department of the Navy. The Soviet replied, “But you’re a landlocked country and don’t need a department
of the Navy.” The Czech leader replied: “Well you have a Department of Justice.”

afterthought, and that’s what stuck in people’s minds. That was a
mistake, because it kind of undermined the notion of democracy

promotion, simply because it was connected to a very unpopular

intervention.

SHAFFER: Taking lessons from that, what can we do to promote
democracy in the aftermath of the “Arab Spring’?

FUKUYAMA: We already are doing a lot. We’ve got organizations
like the National Democratic Institute, or the International
Republican Institute, that are all over Tunisia and Egypt and Libya,
and other places, trying to help them organize political parties, trade
unions, civil-society organizations, that hopefully will allow the more
Western-oriented democrats in those Arab countries to actually
contest in the elections. As we move toward votes in Tunisia and
Egypt we want to have some alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood
and the military. So we’re giving them that kind of assistance right
now. That’s difficult, because they haven’t had experience with
democracy previously.

It’s a long-term struggle, and I think we’ll be disappointed in the
short run. I don’t think the more pro-Western forces are the ones that
will end up on top in the short-run. But we’ve got to start somewhere.

SHAFFER: Is the spread of liberal democracy dependent upon
persisting American hegemony?

FUKUYAMA: It’s been helpful. The U.S. obviously plays a big role
in maintaining a liberal, open world order, through its alliances and
the influence it projects. And American ideas have been very
dominant in the world especially in the last two decades. A lot of that
is shifting now because of the rise of other powers and other ideas.

Day 6: Weaponized Social

The time when the solution to bad speech could be advanced as simply more speech might
seem quaint. The famously libertarian Electronic Frontier Foundation recently released a white
paper in which it acknowledged a line between a clash of ideas and flat-out harassment, with
the latter causing less rather than more robust debate. Separately, concerns about outright
false news that spreads virally have inspired calls for action by intermediaries like Facebook -- a
self-described technology, rather than media, company.

Applying lessons from the conflicts of the past two decades online, how might we agree upon a
vision for social networking even if we disagree on many substantive issues to be debated
there, and what are the roles, if any, of regulators and private platforms in establishing
boundaries on behavior online through code or legal sanction?

Is it more difficult to agree on a vision is our media is no longer about the battlefield or the real
world but /s the battlefield and the real world?

Re: Jeffrey Epstein
Dear Mr. Lefkowitz,

I am in receipt of your e-mail dated May 19, 2008 to the United States Attorney. The U.S.
Attomey would like me to advise you that all communications and inquiries related to the Epstein
matter, will be handled by AUSA Marie Villafana and/or her supervisor, Karen Atkinson, so he does
not intend to respond to your e-mail or calls unless AUSA Villafana and/or her supetvisors advise
him otherwise. Furthermore, you make reference to “our July 8 deadline.” Respectfully, the United

_ States.Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) has never agreed to any such

deadline. Should you decide to provide the SDFL with any additional information, please do so
through AUSA Villafana, and, in her absence, AUSA Atkinson.

On September 24, 2007, your client, Jeffrey Epstein, in consultation with Gerald Lefcourt,
Esq. and Lilly Ann Sanchez, Esq., as well as numerous other nationally-renowned lawyers, including
but not limited to Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, former Independent Counsel and
Solicitor General of the United States Kenneth Starr, just to name a few, entered into a global
resolution of state and federal liabilities faced by your client (“the Agreement”) with the SDFL.
Although you and other members of the défense team have since claimed that the Agreement was
the product of adhesion, the following facts demonstrate that Epstein knowingly and voluntarily
entered into the Agreement in order to avoid a federal indictment regarding his sexual conduct
involving minor victims. Despite the fact that by signing the Agreement, Epstein gave up the right
to object to its provisions, the SDFL bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider
your objections. Since these objections have finally been exhausted and Epstein has previously
expressed his intent to not comply with several of the terms and conditions of the Agreement as set
forth below, the SDFL hereby notifies you that unless he complies with all of the terms and
conditions of the Agreement, as modified by the United States Attorney’s December 19, 2007 letter
to Ms. Sanchez by close of business on Monday, June 2, 2008, the SDFL will elect to terminate the
Agreement.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026718.txt,"While central bank investment tranches are

in some ways comparable to sovereign portfolios,
they are differentiated by the former's broader
market functions

While there are similarities in the approach taken to
investment tranches (in terms of risk asset allocation
and development of internal capability), central banks
have a broader set of functions, including local market
money supply, the role of lender of last resort and
currency exchange rate regime management. These
factors have considerable influence over investment
strategy and capacity, and differentiate central banks
from sovereign investors.

In last year’s report, we focused on emerging
market (EM) central banks due to their increasing
use of investment tranches (reserves sub-portfolios
which prioritise investment return over liquidity),
which have similar allocations to sovereign investor
portfolios. We noted that many of the respondent
banks were moving up the risk spectrum in response
to achieving capital preservation in the face of low
and negative yields, and that reserve managers were
allocating higher levels of reserves to the investment
tranche. We explore how central banks in developed
markets with low financial market exposure have
followed emerging market reserve managers up the
risk spectrum.

Low banking sector exposure is accompanied

by lesser build-up in the levels of reserves and

a growing appetite for risk assets

In this year’s report, we have expanded our central
bank sample and segmented the central bank
universe into developed and emerging markets to
understand differences in strategy and pace of change
with respect to investment tranches. Within developed
market central banks, we further segmented them
into two categories: those with high exposure to
financial markets (DM High FME) and those with

low exposure (DM Low FME?). We summarise these
classifications in figure 27.

While there are various means of calculating
reserves adequacy (with import coverage and short-
term debt coverage most frequently cited in figure
28), all measures link level of reserves to potential
drawdown of funds. Following the Global Financial
Crisis of 2008, DM High FME central banks increased
estimates of the likelinood and size of potential
drawdowns, increasing the level of reserves over
the intervening years to better equip themselves as
‘lenders of last resort’. In 2016, this trend continued
with DM High FME central banks increasing reserves
more rapidly than DM Low FME and EM (figure 29).
DM High FME reserve managers rely on these large
net inflows to maintain high levels of liquidity (with
67% of respondents describing reserves as ‘ample’
in figure 30), and focus less on capital preservation
and investment returns. Furthermore, reserve
managers in High FME markets noted that they are
unwilling to invest in risk assets such as equities
or asset-backed securities as they are seeking to
diversify (not correlate) their reserves from local
financial market shocks.

(Note that both members of this family were awarded BILLION dollar contracts; that's quite
exceptional, no?)

As for terrorism as an US industry, it's hardly better seen than through the following which is
information of course we all know:

We note that in-between Bush #41's 9/11/1990 speech(with Dick Cheney as his Secretary of
Defense) and the 9/11/2001 attack on the WTC were little more than Clinton's 8 years in the White
House. We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between
the actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack
on the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no
uncertain terms sponsored terrorism:

(Writes Scott) The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult
and painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection we
have surveyed:

1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to
participate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing;

2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which could
have prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing;

3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him
free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing;

4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an unindicted coconspirator in the 1993 WTC bombing case
and Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing.

(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State)

Scott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack on
the WTC:

(Writes Scott) For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened,
letting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by some
as conspiracy theory.” Yet in this chapter, | will show that this claim doesn't to arise from theory, but
from facts that are true, even though they have been systemically suppressed or under-reported in
the American mainstream media. | am describing a phenomenon that occurred not just once, but
repeatedly, almost predictably. We shall see that, among the al-Qaeda terrorists who were first
protected and then continued their activities were the following:

1. Ali Mohamed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the leader of the 1998 Nairobi Embassy
bombing;

2. Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier
of both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed;

illustrated the potentially decisive power of one state — Ohio and
Nevada.

A test of Mr. Obama’s support will come June 20, when he will hold
a fund-raiser for about 80 Jewish donors at a private dinner.

John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United
Nations and a possible Republican presidential candidate, argues that
because of administration proposals, Republicans will be able to
make gains not only among American Jews but also among
evangelicals who are supportive of Israel on biblical grounds, and
other voters.

Mr. Bolton said that he was on a cruise sponsored by the conservative
magazine Weekly Standard last week in the Mediterranean, and that
most of the people on the ship “reacted very strongly against” Mr.
Obama’s speech outlining his Mideast vision. “As a Republican,” he
said, “you can use this to show how radical the president’s policies
are on a whole range of issues.”

The depth of Democrats’ worries was evident from the competition to
out-applaud Republicans on Tuesday during Mr. Netanyahu’s speech
to a joint meeting of Congress and from the speed with which
Congressional Democrats led by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the
majority leader, distanced themselves from Mr. Obama on Israel.
‘Are there questions in the American-Jewish community? I think the
answer is yes,” said Mr. Mellman, who is Jewish and has polled the
community for Democrats in the past. “Has Obama been branded as
not pro-Israel or anti-Israel? Not at all.”

“T think he is strongly pro-Israel, in fact,” he added. “But that is the
political struggle in which the Republicans are engaged, which is to
get him branded as not pro-Israel. And to the extent they’re
successful in that, the likelihood is they would have some meaningful
impact on the Jewish vote.”

Is that a true and accurate statement”
The president responded: “That is absolutely true.”

Shortly thereafter, reports began to appear of tape recorded conversations between Linda Tripp
and Monica Lewinsky suggesting that there had been a sexual relationship of some kind between
the President and Monica Lewinsky.

On January 23, 1998 I appeared on the MSNBC program “Internight” and criticized Bennett for
allowing the President to walk into a perjury trap and a swearing contest. I recommended that
the President “get out in front of this story. He has to tell the truth, and if the truth is inculpatory
he has to tell it.” I recommended that the president “get a new lawyer, tell him the truth, sit down
with your new lawyer ... and [have him give you] the straight poop.” The lawyer has to be
someone “who doesn’t care what the president thinks of him. His obligation is to tell the
president what he doesn’t want to hear.”

On January 27, 1998, Robert Bennett called me to complain about what I said on television.
Bennett kept me on the phone for nearly half an hour telling me that I did not understand his
“strategy” in the case and accusing me of “Monday morning quarterbacking” his decisions.

I asked Bennett a direct question: “Did you ever advise the President that in addition to the option
of settling the Jones case, he could simply default on the liability phase of the case?”

Bennett replied that defaulting would have been “ridiculous” and “a stupid idea” and that he
would never recommend it.

I asked Bennett what kind of an investigation he had conducted of the Lewinsky matter before he
allowed the President to be deposed, and he acknowledged that he simply accepted the
President’s word, since it was supported by Lewinsky’s affidavit. I asked him whether he had
ever questioned Lewinsky and gave a vague response. He did say that he was surprised about the
questions asked concerning Lewinsky at the deposition.

I told Bennett that I strongly believed he had made a mistake by walking his client into a perjury
trap and allowing him to get into a swearing contest about his sex life. He assured me that he
knew what he was doing and that it would all work to the advantage of his client. I told him I
hoped he was right, but that I still thought he had made a mistake.

A lawyer owes his client the duty to explain all available legal options, even if he believes that the
client will probably reject a given option. Bennett failed in this duty. He now argues, in his own
defense, that if Clinton had defaulted the Jones case, many more litigants would “come out of the
woodwork” and sued Clinton in the hope that he would default. This is a fallacious argument for
several reasons. First, the statute of limitations would have passed on virtually all allegations
arising — as the Jones case did — before Clinton became President. Even more importantly, the
moment it became public — which it quickly did — that the President previously had offered a
$700,000 settlement to Jones, there was more than enough incentive for gold-diggers to come

Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but Im encouraged and glad for
you. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that 1 not tell him what a disaster lay before
him. what would you like me to tell Barry?

There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work
that i outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it
again if you like ). Brad wechsler was never up to the task . sorry, I realize I have been saying the very
same thing for a long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning
there was Eileen and Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was
chosen from a pool of 2 people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally
augmented his comp in order to get him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax,

He complained for over a year , re his direction by eileen and ada , and then brad. His breakdown was
not a surprise after months and moths of warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with
john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you
told him that he works for you and not for me and that brad needs to pays him .

. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. :

I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen _ )
but somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . _ when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the
task, you bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by
trying to protect you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his
work. it then turns out that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and
continued to make a really dangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes , was also my doing , though
email after email said , I take no responsibility for him,and 1YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM |!!!, , your
response was that was my opinion was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan
you told me he was gone. however he too is still there, and a waste of money and space.

My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the
foreign funds repatriation plan that 1 had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions
to make re my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit
much time and make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced
mess.

That being said, the tasks at hand are the following.

TRY THE PAPER CLIP TEST AGAIN!

Divergent thinking is rarely the final goal; it is rather a jumping off
point for the creation of something new, like a solution to a mathematical
puzzle, a painting, or a novel invention. The exercises allow us to
explicitly see one of the early creative steps — idea generation before the
pruning step. But most creative people often just create, they don’t follow
a scripted process. The term ‘the creative process’ is a great misnomer.
There is no process that actually creates. Process merely puts us in the
right frame of mind to do so. Processes are useful for framing a problem
and ensuring we have all the right tools at our disposal: good crayons,
some nice art paper, a hot cup of coffee. But process must be put to one
side at the moment of actual creation.

Convergent Thinking

Convergent thinking is the opposite of divergent thinking. It focuses
on discovering the final solution to a problem rather than generating
precursor ideas. Some creative people only use this method, avoiding
laborious processes such as brainstorming.

Tests of skill for convergent thinking generally pose puzzles where
there is only one correct answer, but one that requires a non-linear step.
Here’s a really simple convergent thinking puzzle to try. It only requires
a piece of paper and pen. Draw a circle on a piece of paper with a dot in
the center. It should look like this. Do NOT take the tip of the pen off the
paper until you are finished.

random and squeaked when it got caught under the couch.

Technological prediction is particularly chancy, given that technologies progress
by a series of refinements, halted by obstacles and overcome by innovation. Many
obstacles and some innovations can be anticipated, but more cannot. In my own work
with experimentalists on building quantum computers, I typically find that some of the
technological steps I expect to be easy turn out to be impossible, whereas some of the
tasks I imagine to be impossible turn out to be easy. You don’t know until you try.

In the 1950s, partly inspired by conversations with Wiener, John von Neumann
introduced the notion of the “technological singularity.” Technologies tend to improve
exponentially, doubling in power or sensitivity over some interval of time. (For
example, since 1950, computer technologies have been doubling in power roughly
every two years, an observation enshrined as Moore’s Law.) Von Neumann
extrapolated from the observed exponential rate of technological improvement to
predict that “technological progress will become incomprehensively rapid and
complicated,” outstripping human capabilities in the not too distant future. Indeed, if
one extrapolates the growth of raw computing power—expressed in terms of bits and
bit flips—into the future at its current rate, computers should match human brains
sometime in the next two to four decades (depending on how one estimates the
information-processing power of human brains).

The failure of the initial overly optimistic predictions of AI dampened talk about
the technological singularity for a few decades, but since the 2005 publication of Ray
Kurzweil’s The Singularity is Near, the idea of technological advance leading to
superintelligence is back in force. Some believers, Kurzweil included, regard this
singularity as an opportunity: Humans can merge their brains with the
superintelligence and thereby live forever. Others, such as Stephen Hawking and Elon
Musk, worried that this superintelligence would prove to be malign and regarded it as
the greatest existing threat to human civilization. Still others, including some of the
contributors to the present volume, think such talk is overblown.

Wiener’s life work and his failure to predict its consequences are intimately
bound up in the idea of an impending technological singularity. His work on
neuroscience and his initial support of McCulloch and Pitts adumbrated the startlingly
effective deep-learning methods of the present day. Over the past decade, and
particularly in the last five years, such deep-learning techniques have finally exhibited
what Wiener liked to call Gestalt—for example, the ability to recognize that a circle is
a circle even if when slanted sideways it looks like an ellipse. His work on control,
combined with his work on neuromuscular feedback, was significant for the
development of robotics and is the inspiration for neural-based human/machine
interfaces. His lapses in technological prediction, however, suggest that we should
take the notion of a technological singularity with a grain of salt. The general
difficulties of technological prediction and the problems specific to the development of
a superintelligence should warn us against overestimating both the power and the
efficacy of information processing.

A Single Point of Failure

A single point of failure (SPOF) is a part of a system that, if it
fails, will stop the entire system from working.

Grower DESCRIBED anyone who was the sole repository of
secrets that could undo the NSA’s intelligence gathering as “the
single point of failure.” While still shielding his own identity in May
2013, he wrote to Gellman that U.S. intelligence “will most certainly
kill you if they think you are the single point of failure that could
stop this disclosure and make them the sole owner of this informa-
tion.” Such a person of course would be of even greater interest to
adversary intelligence services if they were aware of the payload of
secrets that person was carrying because they could use it to unravel
the NSA’s sources and methods.

Snowden saw himself as that “single point of failure.” We know
that while still in Hong Kong he said he had obtained access to com-
puters that the NSA had penetrated throughout the world and in
Moscow he added that he had had “access to every [NSA] target,
every [NSA] active operation,” against the Chinese. “Full lists of
them,” which, if he chose to share them, could make China “go
dark.” To be sure, he did not refer to Russian intelligence activity in

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016255.txt,"designs and provides at least one case of a provably beneficial system in the sense
introduced above. The overall approach resembles mechanism-design problems in
economics, wherein one incentivizes other agents to behave in ways beneficial to the
designer. The key difference here is that we are building one of the agents in order to
benefit the other.

There are reasons to think this approach may work in practice. First, there is
abundant written and filmed information about humans doing things (and other humans
reacting). Technology to build models of human preferences from this storehouse will
presumably be available long before superintelligent AI systems are created. Second,
there are strong, near-term economic incentives for robots to understand human
preferences: If one poorly designed domestic robot cooks the cat for dinner, not realizing
that its sentimental value outweighs its nutritional value, the domestic-robot industry will
be out of business.

There are obvious difficulties, however, with an approach that expects a robot
to learn underlying preferences from human behavior. Humans are irrational,
inconsistent, weak-willed, and computationally limited, so their actions don’t always
reflect their true preferences. (Consider, for example, two humans playing chess.
Usually, one of them loses, but not on purpose!) So robots can learn from nonrational
human behavior only with the aid of much better cognitive models of humans.
Furthermore, practical and social constraints will prevent all preferences from being
maximally satisfied simultaneously, which means that robots must mediate among
conflicting preferences—something that philosophers and social scientists have struggled
with for millennia. And what should robots learn from humans who enjoy the suffering
of others? It may be best to zero out such preferences in the robots’ calculations.

Finding a solution to the AI control problem is an important task; it may be,
in Bostrom’s words, “the essential task of our age.” Up to now, AI research has focused
on systems that are better at making decisions, but this is not the same as making better
decisions. No matter how excellently an algorithm maximizes, and no matter how
accurate its model of the world, a machine’s decisions may be ineffably stupid in the eyes
of an ordinary human if its utility function is not well aligned with human values.

This problem requires a change in the definition of AI itself—from a field
concerned with pure intelligence, independent of the objective, to a field concerned with
systems that are provably beneficial for humans. Taking the problem seriously seems
likely to yield new ways of thinking about AI, its purpose, and our relationship to it.

different feel to them. My question is this. Is there more to face-to-face
communication between human beings than the simple exchange of
symbolic information?

Let us propose an experiment. I erect a 3D screen with a hi-fi
surround sound system in a university lecture hall and deliver a lecture
to a camera in the adjacent hall. Half the students see the lecture directly,
and half remotely. With modern screens, it might be possible to set up
the experiment so well that is difficult to tell which hall I am actually in.
Is the experience of the remote students the same as the ones sitting in
direct proximity with me? Do mirror neurons fire more strongly and
pick up more information when you see me in the flesh, or is the feeling
that a lecture is better when you are ‘physically there’ an illusion? You are
perhaps less likely to fall asleep in my lecture if you are physically there
because you are afraid I might walk over and hit you! What possible non-
classical effects could be in play when you see an event or communicate
in person that might make the communication different? Here are two
potential differences:

Information in a face-to-face encounter is continuous, not digitized.
Continuous information is infinite in nature and does not have the finite
limitation of digitized data. Of course, if we have digitized the sound
at 24 bits and replayed it with extreme fidelity, there should not be any
loss in information, but the interactivity of the soundscape is hard to
simulate.

Light entering your eye contains information that could be quantum
entangled with the object you are viewing. You become part of the system
rather than merely an independent observer. It is difficult to see why this
would produce a different quality of communication but it is testable.
Set up the lecture experiment and measure the quality of understanding
communicated between the parties.

If we believe our brains are super-Turing, then considering there
might be some similar effects involved in human communication is not
unreasonable, perhaps quantum effects play a role in communication. If
we conclude our brains think classically, then we probably communicate
classically.

who defended O.J. Simpson against murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the

prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying about sex with

young women.

Palm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry
Krischer sent the case to a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once
boasted of accepting only billionaire clients could face a trial. The police had taken a high
school transcript, class schedules and phone messages from Epstein's home that showed.
he knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's
lawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls’ character by showing they had chatted on
myspace.com about smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide
whether the victims - and Epstein - were credible.

Ultimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the
plea agreement left Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein
had been convicted at a trial, he could have been sentenced to anything from probation to
15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek said, adding that the
recommended guideline sentence was 21 months.

Epstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically
required of sex offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court
supervision, who will ensure Epstein is in fact being treated?

The plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was
warranted, how does dropping it before completion benefit the public?

Epstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his
lawyers bought him the protection the state attorney owed to the victims.

IT looks like New York billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein got off easy when he was hit
with a charge of soliciting a prostitute for a happy ending in Palm Beach.

Because if Palm Beach police had their way, Epstein, 53 - who surrendered last Sunday
and is out on $3,000 bail - might have been whacked with far more serious charges of
paying underage girls for sex.

But a state grand jury found the witnesses in the case were not credible and threw out all
but the single charge of soliciting a hooker in his luxurious Palm Beach home. Epstein's
lawyers and friends now say he's the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach Police
Chief Michael Reiter, whom they describe as a born-again nut case.

According to the police investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Palm Beach
Post, detectives took statements from 17 witnesses and five alleged victims. Haley
Robson, 20, a Palm Beach Community College student who described herself as like a

Heidi Fleiss, says she got naked to give Epstein a massage, then brought him six girls

Day 1: Introduction

Welcome! We aspire to the implausible: a nine-day introduction to the unusual dynamics of the
world’s digital space, sufficient for a strategic understanding of what makes it difficult (but far
from impossible) to regulate or shape; who’s trying to do it nonetheless; and how such efforts
have fared over the past twenty years, with an eye towards lessons for influencing the space
and the behavior within it today.

In addition to offering some frameworks for thinking about Internet architecture and policy, and
the curious open and generative nature of the phenomenon, we will delve into the net as a
contingently global phenomenon, and the way that complicates regulation by traditional
sovereigns. Our case study will be the current debates around implementation of Europe’s “right
to be forgotten” in search engine results. As you complete the readings, you might see how
you'd answer the question of what a state like France’s view should be towards the scope of its
RTBF regulation, and whether the kind of “zoning” described in the Cato Institute article from
thirteen years ago (!), is realizable and desirable.

Opportunity

Problem & Solution

InsightsPod offers services such as marketing research, reports composed with said
research, and plan consultation. The service is extremely relevant, timely, and accurate
enabling clients to make informed decisions. Social media platforms such as Facebook,
YouTube, and Twitter are used to gather live feeds on which we run a sentiment
analysis, and in turn, offer our clients a superior approach to market research. We
provide the expertise to companies seeking the means to develop and improve their
products and services. To improve a company's reputation and overall customer
experience, we help identify which customer is dissatisfied in minutes. We help
businesses determine a customer’s intent and buying habits. Through the vast amounts
of data available across social media, we not only help politicians to understand what
their constituencies are talking about but also to influence people, track voters and get
them to vote. Investors who predict stock behavior by interpreting the news and public
sentiment make better trades. InsightsPod can give an insight into public sentiment
quickly and can aid financial institutions, as well as individuals, to make sound
investment decisions.

InsightsPod has already been tested during the recent EU referendum and it is
currently evaluating public opinion on the two US presidential candidates; Donald
Trump and Hillary Clinton. The results that InsightsPod produced during the
referendum proved to be positive in favour of a Brexit, and a week later, Britain voted
to leave the EU, indicating that our model was reliable. The final results of the
referendum were the complete opposite of the poll projected figures; the Leave
campaign won with a 51.9% majority. This is potentially a great example of how polls
are not as reliable as we originally thought them to be when it comes to collecting data
on general public consensus. In contrast, we gather live feeds on significant political
events to aid political figures in their campaigns and activities.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013002.txt,"86 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures

The LIDA cognitive cycle itself is a theoretical construct that can be implemented in many
ways, and indeed other BICAs like CogPrime and Psi also manifest the LIDA cognitive cycle
in their dynamics, though utilizing different particular structures to do so.

Figure 4.13 shows the cycle pictorially, starting in the upper left corner and proceeding
clockwise. At the start of a cycle, the LIDA agent perceives its current situation and allocates
attention differentially to various parts of it. It then broadcasts information about the most
important parts (which constitute the agent’s consciousness), and this information gets features
extracted from it, when then get passed along to episodic and semantic memory, that interact
in the “global workspace” to create a model for the agent’s current situation. This model then,
in interaction with procedural memory, enables the agent to choose an appropriate action and
execute it - the critical “action-selection” phase!

The LIDA Cognitive Cycle in More Depth

We now run through the cognitive cycle in more detail. It begins with sensory stimuli from
the agent’s external internal environment. Low-level feature detectors in sensory memory begin
the process of making sense of the incoming stimuli. These low-level features are passed to
perceptual memory where higher-level features, objects, categories, relations, actions, situations,

anywhere pound for pound. Along the way, a strong national
consciousness was forged in the vein of a twenty-first-century trading
state. Lee’s method of government was not altogether democratic,
and his intrusion into people’s lives bordered on the petty and anal-
retentive: banning spitting, the use of tobacco and chewing gum. The
press, of course, was tightly controlled. Whenever criticized, Lee
scoffed at how an uninhibited media in India, the Philippines and
Thailand had not spared those countries from rampant corruption;
multinationals love Singapore in large measure because of its
meritocracy and honest government. Yes, Singapore is green with
many parks, and so immaculate it borders on the antiseptic. But it is
also a controlled society that challenges ideals of the Western
philosophers.

For Lee has provided for the well-being of his citizens without really
relying on democracy. His example holds out the possibility, heretical
to an enlightened Western mind, that democracy may not be the last
word in human political development. What he has engineered in
Singapore is a hybrid regime: capitalistic it is, but it all occurred—
particularly in the early decades—in a quasi-authoritarian setting.
Elections are held, but the results are never in doubt. There may be
consultations with various political groupings, yet, in fifty years,
there is still little sign that the population is fundamentally unhappy
with the ruling People’s Action Party (though its majority has fallen
somewhat). Unsurprisingly, Lee makes liberals supremely
uncomfortable. Fundamentally Mill, Berlin and many other Western
philosophical theorists and political scientists—from Thomas Paine
and John Locke to Francis Fukuyama of late—hold that people will
eventually wish to wrest themselves from the shackles of repressive
rule. That the innate human desire for free will inevitably engenders
discontent with the ruling class from below—something we have
seen in abundance in the lands of the Arab Spring. Yet, Confucian-

Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records

these documents, not only in defamatory statements broadcast worldwide, but also in his
pleadings before this Court and in recent depositions. Indeed, Dershowitz said in his
media interviews that he wants “everything to be made public” and implied that Edwards
and Cassell had something to hide. Accordingly, Dershowitz has failed to carry his heavy
burden to justify sealing these presumptively-public documents.

L DERSHOWITZ HAS NOT JUSTIFIED SEALING ALLEGED
DEFAMATORY RECORDS THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THIS
DEFAMATION CASE.

In his motion, Dershowitz never recounts the heavy burden that he must carry to seal the
records at issue. To be sure, Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 allows for the sealing
of “confidential” materials. But the Rule begins by recounting the overarching principle that
“t]he public shall have access to all records of the judicial branch of government, except as
provided below.” Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(a). This rule is a codification of the Florida
Supreme Court’s admonition that a “a strong presumption of openness exists for all court
proceedings. A trial is a public event, and the filed records of court proceedings are public
records available for public examination.” Barron vy. Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531
So.2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988) (emphasis added). In light of this presumption of openness, “[t]he
burden of proof in [closure] proceedings shall always be on the party seeking closure.” Jd. To
obtain a sealing order, the party seeking sealing must carry a “heavy burden.” Id.

Remarkably, Dershowitz fails to acknowledge these well-settled principles. More
important, he even fails to cite (much less discuss) the limited substantive exceptions to this

general principle of access— and which specific exception he believes applies to this

The Court will recall the extraordinary lengths to

week we used some leading questions during the deposition.
We tried to also use some nonleading. Leading questions can be

used when? When you have a witness who's associated with the

party on the other side. Well, we said they're ina

clearer example of when leading questions would be appropriate.

The final argument they made, I think last night in

their late replies was that we somehow missed the deadline in

taking their deposition. What they don't disclose I think in

their papers is, your Honor will recall that we had to come to
you, obtain an application for alternative service, and then,
as a result of that, they came in. We did all these things

with the Court's blessing and approval of taking depositions.

Those schedules were discussed with opposing counsel. And as
soon as we'd taken the deposition, within approximately a week,
we provided the designations. That was back in February of
this year. There's no prejudice.

So for all these reasons, we would ask that we be

transfers cancel internally, and there is no source of investment from outside,
simplifies to exhaust of value in taste satisfaction. There is no negative component
because there is no external source of new investment. Tradition through most of
economic history has called this exhaust consumption. Schultz recognized some
consumption as investment in human capital, I said earlier, and limited the exhaust
to “pure consumption”. I will use this and the term “exhaust” interchangeably. Then
transfer, consumption, exhaust and pure consumption belong in the vocabulary too.

So does “invested consumption”, my restatement of Schultz’ “pure investment” in

human capital.

This seems to be the right track. The object is prediction of behavior. The maximand
rule predicts all behavior, and I have sought to build a vocabulary and catechism to
clarify its terms. The right vocabulary, thank gosh, is mostly the one we have all used
since Adam Smith or even Petty. It has needed only a little tweaking and

clarification, as to the two kinds of capital and consumption for example.

There is a “fundamental theorem” of calculus showing how differentials and
integrals fit together. Its proof takes a lot of thought. There is a simpler one for
algebra. Might a fundamental theorem of economics be helpful? Obvious candidates
would include the maximand rule predicting all behavior, the total return truism
explaining the output numerator of the maximand (rate of return), and the present
value rule explaining the capital denominator. For years I chose the maximand rule
as the fundamental theorem. Then | preferred the present value rule as more
fundamental since it explained the denominator. But so would be the total return
truism in explaining the numerator. Now | opt for the judgment of Paris. Let the
three together be the fundamental theorems of economics. The maximand rule is
the centerpiece, and the other two define its terms. All three together are much

easier to follow, mercifully, then the one of calculus.

told me recently. “T struggled on, went to Los Alamos, and thought, ‘Well maybe I’m not
going to be a Nobel Prize winner, but I can still be a scientist.’ All of us who were in
Physics and had these romantic heroes—the Feynmans, the Manhattan Project—realized
that our career trajectory would at best be working on one project at CERN for fifteen
years. That project would either be a failure, in which case there would be no paper, or
it would be a success, in which case you'd be author #300 on the paper and become an
assistant professor at Iowa State.

Internet by connecting physics labs; second, we built the Web; third, we were the first to
do Big Data. We had supercomputers—Crays—which were half the power of your phone
now, but they were the supercomputers of the time. Meanwhile, we were reading this
magazine called Wired, which came out in 1993, and we realized that this tool we
scientists use could have applications for everybody. The Internet wasn’t just about
scientific data, it was a mind-blowing cultural revolution. So when Conde Nast asked me
to take over the magazine, I was like, ‘Absolutely!’ This magazine changed my life.”

Questions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised in Sex Case Against Money Manager -
September 3, 2006

By ABBY GOODNOUGH

PALM BEACH, Fla. — In the summer and autumn of last year, when most of the
mansions here stood empty behind their towering hedges, the police stealthily watched
one at the end of a waterside lane. They monitored the comings and goings of its owner’s
private jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his trash.

The owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money manager with
several billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the
Palm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr.
Epstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her.

In sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a friend
had arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein’s home and give him massages, usually in
their underwear, in exchange for cash.

Most of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated during the
massages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They
identified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled
that his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars.

Mr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged with,
soliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become
increasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised
questions about whether Mr. Epstein’s prominence won him preferential treatment.

By the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein with much

more serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of
unlawful sexual activity with a minor.

Italy: Concerns about Italy have risen to peak levels since the election of a populist government in
May and credit default swaps have increased to reflect these higher risks. The government’s
expansive fiscal plan, with a proposed budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP, may be rejected by the
European Union commission and result in rating downgrades. While the EU is likely to manage this
situation in its usual incremental and reactive way, the possibility of new elections in late 2019
reigniting euro viability questions will keep Italy on our radar screens.

BREXIT: It is hard to know whether Brexit risks are unchanged, higher or lower given the minute by
minute headlines out of the UK. Our base case remains that while the internal politics of the
Conservative party will keep uncertainty at elevated levels and the European Union will not
compromise on its key tenants of free movement of goods, services, and people, the two sides will
agree to a deal that defers the difficult choices on the shape of a final agreement with the EU until late
2020.

The Middle East: Risks in the Middle East have not changed substantially with respect to Iraq, Syria,
or even the impositions of sanctions on Iran. However, the disappearance of the Saudi journalist who
entered the Saudi Embassy in Turkey on October 2™ has the potential to raise risks to global oil
supply. While there has been a global uproar, it is not yet clear whether the US will impose serious
sanctions or Saudi Arabia would retaliate by reducing oil exports if the US finds sufficient evidence
regarding the alleged killing of the Saudi journalist. The recession in 1973-74 was partly due to the
quadrupling of oil prices due to the Arab Oil Embargo. Later in that decade, the Iranian Revolution
and the Iran-lraq War also led to a 2.5 times spike in oil prices that, along with Federal Reserve
tightening by then Chairman Paul Volcker, led to a US recession. While we think it is unlikely that
Saudi Arabia would react so aggressively in the face of serious US reprisals, we note that it remains a
real risk.

become friendly. They, like me, were concerned about undermining the
Americans’ military and diplomatic coalition.

Shamir mostly listened, until very near the end. He then asked Dan Meridor,
Misha and me to join him in a separate room. He asked each of us for our
views. Misha, even more strongly then in front of the full cabinet, argued that
we could not allow night after night of missile attacks without responding.
Meridor reiterated his opposition, stressing the damage we’d risk doing to the
Americans’ war effort by possibly weakening Arab support for their attack on
Saddam. When Shamir turned to me, I said that if the government did decide on
military action, we were ready. From a purely military and security point-of-
view, I said, an attack made absolute sense. Even if we didn’t succeed in
destroying, or even finding, the mobile launch sites, putting a military force on
the ground would almost surely lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of
Scud launches. But, echoing Meridor, I added that a military response would
carry a price in our relationship with the Americans. My view was that, at least
for now, we should hold off.

When we rejoined the meeting, Shamir rapped his hand on the table. In the
startled silence that followed, he said he shared many ministers’ urge to hit back
against the Scuds. But he said: “At this stage, we’re not going to do anything.
We bite our lips and wait.”

Three nights later, his resolve was stretched almost to breaking point.
Missiles landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, and nearly 40 homes
were damaged. A three-story house was flattened. In all, nearly 100 people were
injured, and three elderly residents died of heart attacks. On the night of January
25, another seven Scuds hit. Nearly 150 apartments were badly damaged, and a
51-year-old man was killed. The pressure on Shamir was all the greater because
the Ramat Gan attack had come within range of one of the Americans’ Patriot
batteries. The Patriots had been originally designed not as anti-missile weapons,
but to attack aircraft, and they seemed to have been ineffective. Nor were
American air strikes in Iraq stopping the Scuds. Though American jets had
taken out a few fixed launch sites, they were having no luck with finding and
destroying mobile launch vehicles.

Even Shamir now felt that unless the Americans got the mobile launchers,
we would have to attack military action. I was sent to Washington along with
Misha and David Ivri, a former air force commander, to deliver that message to
the Bush administration. From the first days after Saddam’s attack on Kuwait,

on bin Laden, whose money, mystique, and connections to wealthy
Gulf Arabs gave Al Qaeda an advantage few other terror groups have
ever enjoyed. Zawahiri has experience in rebuilding broken terrorist
groups; his own organization in Egypt, Al Jihad, was twice wiped out
by operational errors, and Zawahiri had to rally the demoralized
survivors, even pretending to step aside from power, although he was
never really far from the controls. His ultimate solution was to merge
Al Jihad with Al Qaeda, making it into an Egyptian body with a
Saudi head. Now that bin Laden is gone, the challenge for Zawahiri
will be to keep non-Egyptians in Al Qaeda. Members pledged their
loyalty to bin Laden personally, not to the organization, so a new
round of declarations will have to be made, providing Zawahiri an
immediate test of his popularity. One big difference in Zawahiri’s
leadership from that of his predecessor is likely to be a renewed focus
on Egypt. Zawahiri’s terrorist career began when he was fifteen years
old, when he started a cell to overthrow the Egyptian government.
Now the government actually has been overthrown, no thanks to
Zawahiri’s efforts. The country is in a tumultuous and formative but
also vulnerable moment in its history, which Zawahiri will seek to
exploit. He knows that Egypt is the real game in the Islamist contest
for power. The future of Egypt will determine much of what happens
in the rest of the Arab world. No matter how it turns out, the
Egyptian revolution will be seen historically as a bookend to the
Iranian revolution in 1979, which added reality to the radical Islamist
agenda and inspired so many young Muslims, like Zawahiri, to take
up jihad. Iran showed them that they actually could take over a major
Muslim country and turn it into a theocracy. Zawahiri was always
frustrated that it was a Shiite country that became the first important
Islamic theocracy in the modern world. He will devote himself to
making Egypt a Sunni replica of the Iranian state, and not the end of

—MOHANDAS GANDHI

L, February of 2004, I was miserable and overworked.

My travel fantasy began as a plan to visit Costa Rica in March 2004 for four weeks of Spanish and
relaxation. I needed a recharge and four weeks seemed “reasonable” by whatever made-up benchmark
you can use for such a thing.

A friend familiar with Central America dutifully pointed out that it would never work, as Costa Rica
was about to enter its rainy season. Torrential downpours weren’t the uplifting jolt I needed, so I shifted
my focus to four weeks in Spain. It’s a long trip over the Atlantic, though, and Spain was close to other
countries I'd always wanted to visit. I lost “reasonable” somewhere shortly thereafter and decided that I
deserved a full three months to explore my roots in Scandinavia after four weeks in Spain.

If there were any real-time bombs or pending disasters, they would certainly crop up in the first four
weeks, so there really wasn’t any additional risk in extending my trip to three months. Three months
would be great.

Those three months turned into 15, and I started to ask myself, “Why not take the usual 20-30-year
retirement and redistribute it throughout life instead of saving it all for the end?”

The Alternative to Binge Traveling

Thanks to the Interstate Highway System, it is now possible to travel from coast to coast
without seeing anything.

—CHARLES KURALT, CBS news reporter

L, you are accustomed to working 50 weeks per year, the tendency, even after creating the mobility to

take extended trips, will be to go nuts and see 10 countries in 14 days and end up a wreck. It’s like taking
a starving dog to an all-you-can-eat buffet. It will eat itself to death.

I did this three months into my 15-month vision quest, visiting seven countries and going through at
least 20 check-ins and checkouts with a friend who had negotiated three weeks off. The trip was an
adrenaline-packed blast but like watching life on fast-forward. It was hard for us to remember what had

happened in which countries (except Amsterdam),©2 we were both sick most of the time, and we were
upset to have to leave some places simply because our pre-purchased flights made it so.

I recommend doing the exact opposite.

The alternative to binge travel—the mini-retirement—entails relocating to one place for one to six
months before going home or moving to another locale. It is the anti- vacation in the most positive sense.
Though it can be relaxing, the mini-retirement is not an escape from your life but a reexamination of it—
the creation of a blank slate. Following elimination and automation, what would you be escaping from?
Rather than seeking to see the world through photo ops between foreign-but-familiar hotels, we aim to
experience it at a speed that lets it change us.

This is also different from a sabbatical. Sabbaticals are often viewed much like retirement: as a one-
time event. Savor it now while you can. The mini-retirement is defined as recurring—it is a lifestyle. I

Bill: It seems like you’re on your way out. I mean, are you going to quit on us? Second, what if everyone
wants to do the same?

Sherwood: Fair enough. Good points.© First, to be honest, I was close to quitting before, with all the

interruptions and commute and whatnot, but I’m actually feeling great now with the change in routine.

I’m doing more and feel relaxed for a change. Second, no one should be allowed to work remotely unless
they can show increased productivity, and I’m the perfect experiment. If they can show it, however, why
not let them do it on a trial basis? It lowers costs for the office, increases productivity, and makes
employees happier. So, what do you say? Can I test it out for two weeks and come in Fridays to take care
of the office stuff? Il still document everything, and you, of course, have the right to change your mind
at any point.

Bill: Man, you are an insistent one. OK, we’ll give it a shot, but don’t go blabbing about it.

Sherwood: Of course. Thanks, Bill. I appreciate the trust. Talk to you soon.

Sherwood continues to be productive at home and maintains his lower in-office performance. He
reviews the results with his boss after two weeks and continues with four remote days per week for an
additional two weeks until Tuesday, September 19, when he requests a full-time remote trial of two

weeks while he is visiting relatives out of state.©4 Sherwood’s team is in the middle of a project that
requires his expertise, and he is prepared to quit if his boss refuses. He realizes that, just as you want to
negotiate ad pricing close to deadlines, getting what you want often depends more on when you ask for it
than how you ask for it. Though he would prefer not to quit, his income from shirts is more than enough
to fund his dream-lines of Oktoberfest and beyond.

His boss acquiesces and Sherwood doesn’t have to use his threat of quitting. He goes home that
evening and buys a $524 round-trip ticket, less than one week’s shirt sales, to Munich for Oktoberfest.

Now he can implement all the time-savers possible and hack out the inessentials. Somewhere between
drinking wheat beer and dancing in lederhosen, Sherwood will get his work done in fine form, leaving
his company better off than prior to 80/20 and leaving himself all the time in the world.

But hold on a second ... What if your boss still refuses? Hmm ... Then they force your hand. If upper
management won’t see the light, you’Il just have to use the next chapter to fire their asses.

An Alternative: The Hourglass Approach

L can be effective to take a longer period of absence up front in what some NR have termed the

“hourglass” approach, so named because you use a long proof-of-concept up front to get a short remote
agreement and then negotiate back up to full-time out of the office. Here’s what it looks like.

1. Use a preplanned project or emergency (family issue, personal issue, relocation, home repairs,
whatever) that requires you to take one or two weeks out of the office.

2. Say that you recognize you can’t just stop working and that you would prefer to work instead of
taking vacation days.

3. Propose how you can work remotely and offer, if necessary, to take a pay cut for that period (and
that period only) if performance isn’t up to par upon returning.

4. Allow the boss to collaborate on how to do it so that he or she is invested in the process.

attitude that has to be confronted in various cases.
Frequently, if there's domestic violence that's at issue, an
expert witness comes in to explain to the jury, oh, why didn't

she leave? Why did she stay with this fellow who was beating

her up? She was free to walk out of the relationship. Why

didn't she do so? And there is a whole literature that I know

your Honor is familiar with and that we cited in our brief, as

well.

We don't want to get into that in front of the jury in
this particular case. This is a blame the victim tactic that
shouldn't be allowed. This has very marginal, if any,

probative value and a very significant prejudicial effect

because the jury will potentially blame the victim for staying
with her abusive spouse.

Now, in addition, you'll notice from the pleading that

the defendants aren't intent just on asking questions about

this, but they also want to go into the whole criminal case
against Ms. Giuffre's husband, you know, whether he appeared or
what the felony charges are and a variety of things. That,
obviously, has even less probative value than the information I
was discussing a moment ago and should be independently

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028090.txt,"Yet the most immediate security concerns were right next door. In Lebanon,
Hizbollah fighters were being armed and financed by the Iranians and by Syria
as well. They were mounting increasingly effective operations against the
Israeli troops we’d left in the security zone. Even closer to home, Palestinian
attacks on both troops and civilians, though on nowhere near the scale of the
first months of the intifada, showed no sign of ending. I had my own views on
both. In Lebanon, I still believed we should pull out all our troops and focus our
security arrangements on what really mattered: protecting the citizens of
northern Israel. As for the lessons to be learned from the intifada, my view that
we needed a political dialogue had inadvertently become public, from remarks I
made in Moshe Dayan’s honor at a memorial event a few months before
becoming chief of staff. “We are currently in a struggle with the Palestinians — a
long, bitter and continuing struggle,” I said. “A people cannot choose its
neighbors. But we will have to talk to the Palestinians about matters, especially
about issues that are vital to them.”

Still, I was the commander of the armed forces, not a politician. Though all
chiefs of staff had political influence, if only as part of the decision-making
process on all major security questions, making policy was for our elected
government. My main focus was on how to improve the military’s fitness to
respond. I’d lived through, and more recently fought in, all of Israel’s wars. I
felt that we had yet to apply some of the critical lessons from those conflicts.
Leading tanks into battle against the Egyptians’ deadly Sagger missiles in 1973,
and a decade later watching whole Israeli armored columns stalled and attacked
by small bands of PLO fighters or Syrian commandos in Lebanon, had hardened
my conviction that Israel needed a leaner, more mobile army, with more
specialised strike units, as well as more easily targeted, less vulnerable weapons
systems. I wanted to shift the emphasis to weaponry that relied on Israel’s
strengths in new technology, invention and engineering. In a sense, this was the
macroscopic equivalent of one of the guiding principles of Sayeret Matkal:
brains, not just brawn.

While cost-saving wasn’t the catalyst, I did realize that a change in strategy
would mean a change in how we allocated our resources. When Israel bought its
first Mirage jets from France in the 1960s, they cost about a million dollars
apiece. The price tag of an F-16 was now closer to fiftv million dollars. The cost
of a tank had increased tenfold. I wasn’t going to deprive the air force of state-
of-the-art aircraft, key to our ability to fight and win a war. But while we still
needed a strong armored corps, it was important to realize that units like the

Origins and Structure

From the 1950s to the 1970s, when the United States maintained an alliance with the
regime of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan, pro-PRC organizations faced challenges gaining
traction in the United States. During the 1950s, the FBI, aided by pro-Kuomintang security
organizations, closely monitored their activities and participants. This antagonistic state
of affairs began to change after President Nixon’s historic trip to China in 1972.'On
February 24, 1973, more than forty Chinese on the East Coast, most of them immigrants
from Taiwan, established the Washington Association to Promote China Unification to
help advocate for Beijing’s official positions. One of the founders was a professor at the
University of Maryland who was actively involved in organizations that already supported
China’s position on Taiwan and Tibet.? However, a more beneficial contribution came

in the form of advancing US-China scientific, educational, and cultural exchanges that
started to be promoted by a growing number of preeminent Chinese American scientists,
engineers, and academics who were also advising the Chinese government to launch
reforms in science and education. These Chinese Americans were also personally helping
them establish various programs to bring thousands of talented Chinese students to
American institutions of learning.

Recognizing the achievements, influence, and growth of the Chinese diaspora, Beijing
undertook a systematic program designed to target and exploit overseas Chinese
communities as a means of furthering its own political, economic, and security interests.
The Beijing government used specialized bureaucracies to manage what it called “united
front” activities abroad. Organizations such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office inside
the Communist Party Central Committee’s United Front Work Department? and the State
Council’s Taiwan Affairs Office led the charge. Almost all of these agencies have established
nongovernmental fronts overseas, including the China Council for the Promotion of
Peaceful National Reunification, the China Overseas Exchange Association, and the China
Overseas Friendship Association.* Other “united front” organizations, such as the Chinese
Enterprise Association and other Chinese chambers of commerce, are almost always linked
both to the United Front Work Department and to the Ministry of Commerce.

Following the violent crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in Beijing on June 4,
1989, the Chinese Communist Party redoubled its efforts to reach out to overseas Chinese.
Many members of these communities had supported the student democracy movement,
providing funds and safe havens for fleeing dissidents. But senior Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping was not dissuaded. In 1989 and again in 1993, he spoke of the “unique
opportunity” overseas Chinese offered the PRC. Deng insisted that by drawing on their
help, China could break out of international isolation and improve its international
political standing. Gaining influence over overseas Chinese groups in order to “turn them
into propaganda bases for China” became an important task of overseas Chinese united
front work.*

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016912.txt,"“INFORMATION” FOR WIENER, FOR SHANNON, AND FOR US
David Kaiser

David Kaiser is Germeshausen Professor of the History of Science and professor of
Physics at MIT, and head of its Program in Science, Technology & Society. He is the
author of How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum
Revival and American Physics and the Cold War Bubble (forthcoming).

In The Sleepwalkers, a sweeping history of scientific thought from ancient times through
the Renaissance, Arthur Koestler identified a tension that has marked the most dramatic
leaps of our cosmological imagination. In reading the great works of Nicolaus
Copernicus and Johannes Kepler today, Koestler argued, we are struck as much by their
strange unfamiliarity—their embeddedness in the magic or mysticism of an earlier age—
as by their modern-sounding insights.

I detect that same doubleness—the zig-zag origami folds of old and new—in
Norbert Wiener’s classic The Human Use of Human Beings. First published in 1950 and
revised in 1954, the book is in many ways extraordinarily prescient. Wiener, the MIT
polymath, recognized before most observers that “society can only be understood through
a study of the messages and the communication facilities which belong to it.”. Wiener
argued that feedback loops, the central feature of his theory of cybernetics, would play a
determining role in social dynamics. Those loops would not only connect people with
one another but connect people with machines, and—crucially—machines with
machines.

Wiener glimpsed a world in which information could be separated from its
medium. People, or machines, could communicate patterns across vast distances and use
them to fashion new items at the endpoints, without “moving a...particle of matter from
one end of the line to the other,” a vision now realized in our world of networked 3D
printers. Wiener also imagined machine-to-machine feedback loops driving huge
advances in automation, even for tasks that had previously relied on human judgment.
“The machine plays no favorites between manual labor and white-collar labor,” he
observed.

For all that, many of the central arguments in Zhe Human Use of Human Beings
seem closer to the 19th century than the 21st. In particular, although Wiener made
reference throughout to Claude Shannon’s then-new work on information theory, he
seems not to have fully embraced Shannon’s notion of information as consisting of
irreducible, meaning-free bits. Since Wiener’s day, Shannon’s theory has come to
undergird recent advances in “Big Data” and “deep learning,” which makes it all the
more interesting to revisit Wiener’s cybernetic imagination. How might tomorrow’s
artificial intelligence be different if practitioners were to re-invest in Wiener’s guiding
vision of “information”?

When Wiener wrote Zhe Human Use of Human Beings, his experiences of war-related
research, and of what struck him as the moral ambiguities of intellectual life amid the
military-industrial complex, were still fresh. Just a few years earlier, he had announced

Palm Beach Post Editorial #3

Spare us the outrage

Wednesday, February 13, 2008

An 11-month police investigation led to an indictment on one felony charge of
solicitation of prostitution. That was in July 2006, and part-time Palm Beacher
Jeffrey Epstein still has faced no repercussions for allegedly preying on underage
girls.

So maybe Mr. Epstein is satisfied that he's getting his money's worth from his large
legal team, which includes Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz
(remember O.J. Simpson?) and Kenneth Starr (remember Monica Lewinsky?). Jack
Goldberger of West Palm Beach, who's also on the team, told Post columnist Jose
Lambiet in November: This case is absolutely going to end without a trial within
the next two months.

He was wrong, but Mr. Goldberger remains on Mr. Epstein's payroll, feigning
moral outrage at two lawsuits filed this year against the Manhattan money

manager. The lawsuits allege sexual exploitation of teenaged girls, one of

them as young as 14. Said Mr. Goldberger after the first lawsuit, seeking

more than $50 million, was filed on Jan. 24: We think this shows what this

case is all about: money. Yes, it is - Mr. Epstein's effort to buy his way out

of prosecution.

According to the lawyer of a 17-year-old whose parents are suing him, Mr. Epstein
masturbated in front of her (she was 14 at the time) and used a vibrator on her at his
home in February 2005. Another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann Sanchez dismissed it:
Jeffrey Epstein did not have sex with this woman.

For those girls who claim that he did, Mr. Epstein's lawyers maintain that he did not
know their ages, despite a police search of his home and garbage that found phone
messages about the girls’ school schedules and even a high school transcript. For all of
his money, Mr. Epstein's best defense remains I didn't know that I was a criminal
pervert?

investment banker began serving 18 months in jail.

US Equities Have Been Shunned All Along

In both our 2018 Outlook and mid-year update, we highlighted the surprising absence of inflows into
US equities based on flows into mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds. As shown in Exhibit 9,
flows into US equities were negative in 2018, even before the recent downdraft. In fact, US equities
have seen outflows of $81 billion through August 2018 (based on the most recent comprehensive
data), while non-US developed equities and emerging market equities have had inflows of $72 billion
and $20 billion respectively. This is further evidence of our view that while sentiment and short term
positioning among speculators and hedge fund managers shifts frequently, more stable investors
have shunned US equities during this long bull market in favor of other developed and emerging
market equities and global bonds.

This steady outflow of assets from US equities has been offset by record levels of stock buybacks by
US companies given high levels of profitability and incremental cash from repatriation of overseas
earnings, as mentioned above.

All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their 
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already 
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect in

The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source.

witnesses would say the Fifth to everything, and then you look
at the jury and you say, okay, now you can impose an adverse
inference against anybody you want to based on the questions
that the lawyers asked. I mean, that's really what this ends
up being, and it's a waste of time, and it is of no evidentiary
significance.

Then the last point, which I'm just going to need to

correct Mr. Cassell on, the plaintiffs were saying somehow that

we were untimely in not designating portions of these

depositions which we believe are wholly inadmissible, and the

point of our reply was, wait a minute, you didn't designate any

Keynes showed otherwise by invoking the old paradox of thrift. If everyone put
money in vaults instead of consuming, consumption would go down while money
piled up. But the added money would find less output to buy with it, as nothing new
was created to compensate for the drop in consumption. The value of the piled-up
money would vanish in inflation. Saving would equal investment in the end because

Pay me fifty million dollars. Or pay the IRS seven times that

At first Epstein did not demand his fee up front. Instead he
asked that the payment— often a substantial one—be put into
escrow. If his strategy worked, he'd get paid. If not, the money
bounced back to the client.

In 1982, Epstein sold his wealthy friends, his friends’ wealthy
relatives, and others on an oil-drilling deal. One of the investors,
Michael Stroll, had run Williams Electronics, an entertainment

* The defense immediately raised concerns regarding the non-independence
of the review when told that it would be Mr. Oosterbaan tasked with
providing the review, but was told that when Mr. Oosterbaan rendered his
prior opinion, “he was not really up to speed on the facts”

o CEOS’ review was not de novo:

 By letter dated May 15, 2008 (four days before Mr. Sloman’s letter), Mr.
Oosterbaan advised Mr. Lefkowitz that CEOS reviewed the matter only
for abuse of discretion:

[T]he question we sought to answer was whether U.S.
Attorney Acosta would abuse his discretion if he
authorized prosecution in this case.

See Tab 38, May 15, 2008 Letter from D. Oosterbaan, p. 1 (emphasis
added). See also, id. p. 2 (“Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his
discretion if he decided to pursue such a course of action.”); and p. 5
(“Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he
authorized federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein.”).

«For the factual record of its “abuse of discretion” review, CEOS relied on
the very same prosecution memo that it had already reviewed in rendering
its prior opinion, stating:

As you know, our review of this case is limited, both factually and
legally. We have not looked at the entire universe of facts in this
case.

See Id., p. 1 (emphasis added).

«Nor did CEOS review any facts related to the irregular provisions in the

Deferred Prosecution Agreement or the numerous complaints of

prosecutorial misconduct, both of which are inextricably intertwined with

the impropriety of the investigation. Jd. at 1.

a, NOTIFICATION OF WITNESSES.

Mr. Sloman’s Letter:

e Mr. Sloman dismissed the totality of the defense’s objections to the inappropriate
notification the SDFL proposed to send to its witnesses, stating merely that:

“[Y Jou objected to victims[”] being notified of time and place of Epstein’s
state[-]court sentencing hearing.”

Case No.: CACE 15-000072

Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 8 of 20

Because the Government now contested the joinder motion, Edwards and
Cassell prepared a more detailed pleading explaining the justification for granting the
motion. One week after receiving the Government’s objection, on December 30, 2014, Ms.
Giuffre (i.e., Jane Doe No. 3) and Jane Doe No. 4 filed a motion (and later a corrected motion)
seeking to join the case. DE 279 and DE 280. (Note: DE 280 is the first of the three documents
Dershowitz seeks to have declared “confidential” in this case.) Uncertain as to the basis for the
Government’s objection, the motion briefly proffered the circumstances that would qualify
the two women as “victims” eligible to assert rights under the CVRA. See 18 U.S.C. 3771(e)
(defining “crime victim” protected under the Act). With regard to Ms. Giuffre, the motion
indicated that when she was a minor, Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to Dershowitz and Prince
Andrew (among others) for sexual purposes. Jane Doe No. 3 stated that she was prepared to
prove her proffer. See DE 280 at 3 (“If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe No. 3 would prove
the following . ... “). The motion also provided specific reasons why Jane Doe No. 3’s
participation was relevant to the case, including the pending discovery issues regarding
Dershowitz and Prince Andrew. DE 280 at 9-10 (explaining several reasons participation of new
victims was relevant to existing issues).

After the motion was filed, various news organizations published articles about
it. Dershowitz also made numerous media statements about the filing, including calling Jane
Doe No. 3 “a serial liar” who “has lied through her teeth about many world

leaders.” —_ http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/us/dershowitz-sex-allegation/, Dershowitz also

repeatedly called Edwards and Cassell “two sleazy, unprofessional, disbarable lawyers.” Id On

is Just and necessary.

But the imperative, inescapable accompaniment to Israel is Palestine.
A two-state solution is the only strategic and moral answer to the
wars since 1948 that have left countless Palestinians bereft of home
and dignity, living under an Israeli dominion as corrosive of its
masters as it is punishing to its victims.

Judt, who later suggested the binational idea was utopian, penned a
provocation. Its spark was that the current impasse is untenable:
Israel cannot be at once Jewish and democratic if it permanently
disenfranchises millions of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
While I disagreed with his proposed resolution, I agree that the
occupation is untenable and I found the hounding of Judt, who died
last year of Lou Gehrig’s disease, an appalling instance of the
methods of the relentless Israel-right-or-wrong bullies.

Enter the second Tony of this saga, Tony Kushner, the Pulitzer-prize
winning author of “Angels in America.” His honorary degree from
the City University of New York gets blocked on May 2 after a
trustee called Jeffrey Wiesenfeld — like Judt from a family of
Holocaust survivors — suggests Kushner is an “extremist” opponent
of Israel.

Wiesenfeld, by the way, is not sure Palestinians are human given that
they “worship death for their children.”

For anyone familiar with the Judt saga, Kushner’s travails have a
familiar ring. He’s interested in historical facts, which include
Palestinians being driven from their homes in 1948; he’s appalled by
the ongoing Israeli settlement policy and is a board member of an
organization that has supported boycotting West Bank settlements
(although Kushner told me he’s against a boycott); he’s mused about
one state.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019926.txt,"Corzine, the former Goldman chief and future United States senator and governor of New
Jersey, climbing the Goldman ranks when Bannon was at the firm, was unaware of
Bannon. When Bannon was appointed head of the Trump campaign and became an
overnight press sensation—or question mark—his credentials suddenly included a
convoluted story about how Bannon & Co. had acquired a stake in the megahit show
Seinfeld and hence its twenty-year run of residual profits. But none of the Seinfeld
principals, creators, or producers seem ever to have heard of him.

Mike Murphy, the Republican media consultant who ran Jeb Bush’s PAC and became a
leading anti-Trump movement figure, has the vaguest recollection of Bannon’s seeking PR
services from Murphy’s firm for a film Bannon was producing a decade or so ago. “I’m
told he was in the meeting, but I honestly can’t get a picture of him.”

The New Yorker magazine, dwelling on the Bannon enigma—one that basically
translated to: How is it that the media has been almost wholly unaware of someone who is
suddenly among the most powerful people in government?—tried to trace his steps in
Hollywood and largely failed to find him. The Washington Post traced his many addresses
to no clear conclusion, except a suggestion of possible misdemeanor voter fraud.

In the midnineties, he inserted himself in a significant role into Biosphere 2, a project
copiously funded by Edward Bass, one of the Bass family oil heirs, about sustaining life in
space, and dubbed by Jime one of the hundred worst ideas of the century—a rich man’s
folly. Bannon, having to find his opportunities in distress situations, stepped into the
project amid its collapse only to provoke further breakdown and litigation, including
harassment and vandalism charges.

After the Biosphere 2 disaster, he participated in raising financing for a virtual currency
scheme (MMORPGs, or MMOs) called Internet Gaming Entertainment (IGE). This was a
successor company to Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), a dot-com burnout, whose
principals included the former child star Brock Pierce (The Mighty Ducks) who went on to
be the founder of IGE, but was then pushed out. Bannon was put in as CEO, and the
company was subsumed by endless litigation.

Distress is an opportunistic business play. But some distress is better than others. The
kinds of situations available to Bannon involved managing conflict, nastiness, and relative
hopelessness—in essence managing and taking a small profit on dwindling cash. It’s a
living at the margins of people who are making a much better living. Bannon kept trying
to make a killing but never found the killing sweet spot.

Distress is also a contrarian’s game. And the contrarian’s impulse—equal parts
personal dissatisfaction, general resentment, and gambler’s instinct—started to ever more
strongly fuel Bannon. Part of the background for his contrarian impulse lay in an Irish
Catholic union family, Catholic schools, and three unhappy marriages and bad divorces
(journalists would make much of the recriminations in his second wife’s divorce filings).

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016282.txt,"I was introduced to Max Tegmark some years ago by his MIT colleague Alan Guth, the
father of the inflationary universe. A distinguished theoretical physicist and cosmologist
himself, Max’s principal concern nowadays is the looming existential risk posed by the
creation of an AGI (artificial general intelligence—that is, one that matches human
intelligence). Four years ago, Max co-founded, with Jaan Tallinn and others, the Future
of Life Institute (FL), which bills itself as “an outreach organization working to ensure
that tomorrow ’s most powerful technologies are beneficial for humanity.” While ona
book tour in London, he was in the midst of planning for FLI, and he admits being driven
to tears in a tube station after a trip to the London Science Museum, with its exhibitions
spanning the gamut of humanity’s technological achievements. Was all that impressive
progress in vain?

FLI’s scientific advisory board includes Elon Musk, Frank Wilczek, George
Church, Stuart Russell, and the Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom, who dreamed up an
oft-quoted Gedankenexperiment that results in a world full of paper clips and nothing
else, produced by an (apparently) well-meaning AGI who was just following orders. The
Institute sponsors conferences (Puerto Rico 2015, Asilomar 2017) on AI safety issues and
in 2018 instituted a grants competition focusing on research in aid of maximizing the
societal benefits of AGI.

While Max is sometimes listed—by the non-cognoscenti—on the side of the
scaremongers, he believes, like Frank Wilczek, ina future that will immensely benefit
jrom AGI if in the attempt to create it, we can keep the human species from being
sidelined.

it. Find another, create a work-around, and so on. By doing this, we are
effectively mechanically generalizing our solution. This is forbidden as
it breaks the Turing limit, so we can’t mechanically solve a general logic
problem above the logic limit. We need instead to use intuitive or creative
thought. In our panic we did not stop, take a step back and engage our
brain. Instead, we attempted, unsuccessfully, to blindly hack our way
through the problem.

If we eventually succeeded in perfecting the code this way, we
would have broken a fundamental law of the Universe. Something nasty
would have to happen to prevent it, such as rupturing the space-time
continuum or an event equally horrible! Luckily something prevents this
and keeps our Universe intact - BUGS! Bugs stop us breaking Turing’s
limit.

The next time you curse a bug, remember if they didn’t exist youd be
in danger of causing a logical paradox. There is no problem in redefining
the domain and then creatively producing an all-encompassing design,
but, you can’t patch and hack your way there. This theory of bugs leads to
an explanation for some modern programming rules of thumb.

Written specifications are valuable because they force you to lay out
the whole problem. You don't need to be detailed regarding the depth,
but should be expansive about the breadth, covering all the logical
complexity. This might result in many details as a by-product, but a
specification needs to delineate the edges of the problem space and not
simply focus on a few key points.

Writing the tests for the software in advance is helpful as it is likely
to tell you early whether your design encompasses the whole problem
space.

Also, building a prototype, throwing it away, and then building the
real thing can help greatly. It may be the only way to examine the edges
of the problem space in detail. Armed with a full understanding, you
can then imagine solutions to the complete problem in a single creative
sitting. Whatever techniques you use to improve the quality of your
software, remember you are engaged in a creative process that is not,
itself, open to automation.

The Art of Programming

Programming is an art: a creative endeavor. It is also, of course, highly
scientific. When you work with a good programmer — and I have been
fortunate to work with some of the best in the world — they all follow
a similar process. First they talk with you at length about your needs

achines cannot discover theorems using algorithms, yet
AY Eee do it all the time. Do the rest of us break the

logic limit? It seems we do. People appear creative — painting,
composing, sculpting and so forth. But, are these endeavors creative
in the mathematical sense. To prove this, ironically we need to find
something outside mathematics that is definitely non-computable. This
is tricky. Most artistic things are fuzzily defined and there are no written
rules we can apply. How can we prove a work of art could not have been
generated by a computer?

Trivial proofs exist but they are rather contrived. For example, it
would not be possible to make a film with a solution to the still unproven
Riemann Hypothesis on the blackboard in the background of a movie
scene. All the mathematics Good Will Hunting had been already
discovered before the movie was made. New mathematics cannot be
accidentally generated by a set designer — unless, of course, they also
happened to be a world class mathematician.

These trivial proofs might lead a mathematician to argue the theory
is proven. There are some artworks which cannot be computed. QED. But
these are not very satisfactory proofs. I could create almost any movie I
wanted without tripping over this rule. What I really wanted to know is
whether Good Will Hunting as a whole could have been generated by a
computer. Not that some weird version with a particular mathematical
proof on the blackboard is forbidden. Movies are a difficult subject for

signals across a range of sectors and macro prices is typically a warning that markets
have moved too far too fast in a more general sense.

The last comparable episode was in early July in the wake of the Brexit sell-off. At that
point Defensives were hitting record over bought signals with Financials and Cyclicals
seeing the opposite. Against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty over the effects of
Brexit the models provided a great signal to fade the violent rotation.

With these signals in mind we look for a period of consolidation in the rotation trade.
The models are short term in nature and are not intended to identify strategic turning
points — although like in the case of Brexit they do tend to emphasize when a crescendo
is reached. While we would look for another potential leg in some of the reflation trades
over the coming months we would prefer to wait for a pull back. The Basic Resources
sector provides a useful example in how to use the models tactically. Three times this
year prior to the current instance the sector has hit overbought levels on its relative CT|
indicator. Previous pullbacks lasted 4-8 weeks and averaged -11% in relative
performance terms.

weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation
starting from where you were, to where you are currently . youhave madea hell ofa deal. -- negotiating
down my original amount requested , calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was
partially my fault. (though in that specific example , I had never been asked to do more than merely provide
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. (by the way ,,suggesting now, that your
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past.

In order to move forward

I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will
have this year for my time . (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but Iam, under no
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness. and those very circumstances I took
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear
of your own design )

I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . (
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said
you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion
of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of
our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps ..
However, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the
required work yourself. I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,.
share moments ideas etc.. Iam of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route .
always . It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine .

We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019932.txt,"liberals would have to oppose them.

Bannon’s mission was to puncture the global-liberal-emperor-wears-no-clothes bubble,
nowhere, in his view, as ludicrously demonstrated as the refusal to see the colossally
difficult and costly effects of uncontrolled immigration. He wanted to force liberals to
acknowledge that even liberal governments, even the Obama government, were engaged
in the real politics of slowing immigration—ever hampered by the liberal refusal to
acknowledge this effort.

The EO would be drafted to remorselessly express the administration’s (or Bannon’s)
pitiless view. The problem was, Bannon really didn’t know how to do this—change rules
and laws. This limitation, Bannon understood, might easily be used to thwart them.
Process was their enemy. But just doing it—the hell with how—and doing it immediately,
could be a powerful countermeasure.

Just doing things became a Bannon principle, the sweeping antidote to bureaucratic
and establishment ennui and resistance. It was the chaos of just doing things that actually
got things done. Except, even if you assumed that not knowing how to do things didn’t
much matter if you just did them, it was still not clear who was going to do what you
wanted to do. Or, a corollary, because nobody in the Trump administration really knew
how to do anything, it was therefore not clear what anyone did.

Sean Spicer, whose job was literally to explain what people did and why, often simply
could not—because nobody really had a job, because nobody could do a job.

Priebus, as chief of staff, had to organize meetings, schedules, and the hiring of staff;
he also had to oversee the individual functions of the executive office departments. But
Bannon, Kushner, Conway, and the president’s daughter actually had no specific
responsibilities—they could make it up as they went along. They did what they wanted.
They would seize the day if they could—even if they really didn’t know how to do what
they wanted to do.

Bannon, for instance, even driven by his imperative just to get things done, did not use
a computer. How did he do anything? Katie Walsh wondered. But that was the difference
between big visions and small. Process was bunk. Expertise was the last refuge of liberals,
ever defeated by the big picture. The will to get big things done was how big things got
done. “Don’t sweat the small stuff’ was a pretty good gist of Donald Trump’s—and Steve
Bannon’s—worldview. “Chaos was Steve’s strategy,” said Walsh.

Bannon got Stephen Miller to write the immigration EO. Miller, a fifty-five-year-old
trapped in a thirty-two-year-old’s body, was a former Jeff Sessions staffer brought on to
the Trump campaign for his political experience. Except, other than being a dedicated far-
right conservative, it was unclear what particular abilities accompanied Miller’s political
views. He was supposed to be a speechwriter, but if so, he seemed restricted to bullet
points and unable to construct sentences. He was supposed to be a policy adviser but knew

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016296.txt,"Throughout his career, whether studying language, advocating a realistic biology of
mind, or examining the human condition through the lens of humanistic Enlightenment
ideas, psychologist Steven Pinker has embraced and championed a naturalistic
understanding of the universe and the computational theory of mind. He is perhaps the
first internationally recognized public intellectual whose recognition is based on the
advocacy of empirically based thinking about language, mind, and human nature.

“Just as Darwin made it possible for a thoughtful observer of the natural world to
do without creationism, ” he says, “Turing and others made it possible for a thoughtful
observer of the cognitive world to do without spiritualism. ”

In the debate about AI risk, he argues against prophecies of doom and gloom,
noting that they spring from the worst of our psychological biases—exemplified
particularly by media reports: “Disaster scenarios are cheap to play out in the
probability-free zone of our imaginations, and they can always find a worried,
technophobic, or morbidly fascinated audience.” Hence, over the centuries: Pandora,
Faust, the Sorcerer’s Apprentice, Frankenstein, the population bomb, resource depletion,
HAL, suitcase nukes, the Y2K bug, and engulfment by nanotechnological grey goo. “A
characteristic of AI dystopias,”’ he points out, “is that they project a parochial alpha-
male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. . .. History does turn up the occasional
megalomaniacal despot or psychopathic serial killer, but these are products of a history
of natural selection shaping testosterone-sensitive circuits in a certain species of primate,
not an inevitable feature of intelligent systems.”

In the present essay, he applauds Wiener’s belief in the strength of ideas vis-a-vis
the encroachment of technology. As Wiener so aptly put it, “The machine’s danger to
society is not from the machine itself but from what man makes of it.”

Walsh's success in getting foreign backers on board for the planned Palm House
project, according to the SEC’s complaint, was largely based on lies made to

unsuspecting investors who believed the project carried minimal risk.

In bold font, one marketing brochure claimed that the EB-5 investor money would
only be used for 43 percent of the project’s total costs while the rest would be covered
by a $29 million loan from a “reputable bank” and $22 million in equity from the

developer.
None of that was true.

SARC also claimed the investors’ funds would be held in an escrow account at PNC

wouldn't be touched until then. Investors were even sent photos of a PNC account

Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or 
anything of the kind. 
All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their 
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already 
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect in 
person. 
The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source.

Subject: Oscar Diary 
It's Thursday morning on Wilshire Boulevard and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has just 
opened it's doors for ticket pick-up for the 85th Oscar telecast. 
Forty voting members, the distinguished director Norman Jewison and I are on a long single file line that 
snakes thru the lobby patiently waiting to go upstairs to pick up our tickets. My seats were awarded via 
a lottery system. We clutch our photo I.D. 
Suddenly, a messenger slips in wearing a smart khaki windbreaker and cuts through the line. He announces 
to the uniformed guard in a stage whisper, Dreamworks, and as if Steven Spielberg himself had just 
delivered the Gettysburg address, is ushered upstairs. 
That is the final act of social justice of the Lincoln campaign. 
I am sleep deprived and jet lagged having just spent six hours on a flight sitting next Paula Wagner who 
is Tom Cruise's ex-agent turned Broadway producer for Jessica Chastain's The Heiress. We discuss 
Jessica's not so great chances to beat Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress. I mention Harvey Weinstein's 
concern about Emmanuel Riva's last minute surge. The French phenomena doesn't speak English, has never 
been to L.A. and it's like voting for a ghost, even on her 86th birthday. 
This is the year I got phone calls in September from top studio executives announcing each are winning 
the Oscar. Their euphoric giddiness is due to the quality of the films resulting in the priciest oscar 
campaigns on record and astounding audience support at the theaters. 
Seven of the nine best picture nominees have taken in well over $100 million at the domestic box office 
to date, but it's the worldwide numbers in the millions that are staggering. 
Twentieth Century Fox's Life of Pi caused a tsunami at $595, 
Universal's Les Miserables scored $412, the Weinstein Cos.' Django Unchained whipped up $395, 
DreamWorks' Lincoln delivered at $254, Warner's Argo captured $219, Weinstein's Silver Lining 
Playbook danced to $187 and Sony's Zero Dark Thirty killed at $107 million. 
In comparison, Sony Classics' Amour received $19 and Fox Searchlights' Beast of the Southern Wild 
worked up $19 million. 
Hugh audiences having actually seen the films this year have an ear for the nuances of the Oscar race and 
everyone including Ben Affleck follow the bloggers religiously. 
So by Thursday morning on line at the Academy the informed buzz was as follows: Argo takes best 
picture because is was most entertaining. The director snub to Ben Affleck was a Godsend as George 
Clooney's advice came from far away Berlin where he was in pre-production on The Monuments Men. 
Warner's president Sue Kroll kept the campaign clean and calm on the home front. 
Lincoln's victory is Daniel Day Lewis from day one of shooting, no pun intended. The suggestion that 
Obama is our answer to Lincoln was interesting. Voters knew Obama secretly hosted three screenings in the 
White House, but they weren't invited. The Hollywood Foreign press were the biggest winners with Bill 
Clinton's surprise appearance on their broadcast. DreamWorks' ran an impeccable patriotic campaign that 
the media ate up. 
The best director race had the most drama. Hollywood dreaded Spielberg loosing to Ang Lee. (Eventually 
everyone was thrilled Steven was anointed president of the Cannes Jury for 2013 the day after the awards 
show.) 
The voters knew beloved Ang Lee's three year boat ride was the technical miracle. Fox's $595 million 
international box office blew in the win. 
Harvey Weinstein having three horses running is always the most talked about. His loquacious Quentin 
Tarentino was a lock for screenplay. Best supporting actor was a total toss up with a sentimental edge 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019465 
to Robert DeNiro. We even applauded Bob putting his handprints in cement in front of Grauman's Chinese 
Theater. 
The conversations continued about how our government put the cabasch on Zero Dark Thirty with their 
arrogant denial of enhanced interrogation. Even MPAA President Chris Dodd could not help Mark Boal, 
Katherine Bigalow and Amy Pascal. 
Additional chatter was the renewed last minute love for Les Miserables. Clearly the most polarizing 
film in the race, this 27 year old theatrical musical seen by 60 million fans is now the talk of the 
Oscar weekend. 
Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Amanda Segfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sasha Baron Cohen, Helena 
Bonham Carter and Samanthe Barks are making an historic one time live performance as part of Sunday's 
television broadcast. Producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron's will attempt to razzel dazzel us with an 
homage to movie musicals for three plus hours at the Dolby theater. 
Barbra Streisand, Adele and Shirley Basse's appearances also create high anxiety and a blood bath for 
tickets...hence the hysteria created by DreamWorks' messenger cutting the line. 
After checking into the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel, my home away from home for 30 years of Oscar weekends 
and meticulously laying out all the ensembles sent from Valentino and Ralph Rucci, I hit the party 
circuit overdressed for life. 
Daisy... I can do this...fairly easily now...but I have a lunch at 12:30pm and important meetings. I am 
so distraught about all this pressure. I am calling you now. Peggy

Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 14 of 20

Dershowitz description of what was said is not true.” Statement of Ms. McCawley on Behalf of
David Boies (Oct. 15, 2015).

More broadly, the Court can readily see from this passage how Dershowitz is willing to
inject into the record a part of Ms. Giuffre’s affidavit whenever it serves his purpose — and,
indeed, to characterize the part of the affidavit as “preposterous.” But then he asks this Court to
place the underlying affidavit under seal, so that the Edwards and Cassell stand accused having
filed a “preposterous” affidavit without anyone being able to assess the validity of Dershowitz’s
attack.

Dershowitz has referred to the court records that he now wishes to have the Court declare
confidential not only in his deposition, but also in his widely-broadcast media attacks on
Edwards and Cassell. For example, Dershowitz appeared on the British Broadcasting
Corporation (the BBC) and was asked about the allegations:

Well, first of all they were made in court papers that they don’t even ask for a hearing
to try to prove them. They put them in court papers in order to immunize themselves
from any consequences from a defamation suit. The story is totally made

up, completely out of whole cloth.

I don’t know this woman. I was not at the places at the times. It is part of a pattern of
made up stories against prominent people and world leaders. And the lawyers in
recent statement challenged me to deny the allegations under oath. I am doing that. I
am denying them under oath, thus subjecting me to a perjury prosecution were I not
telling the truth. 7 am now challenging them to have their client put these charges
under oath and for them to put them under oath. I am also challenging them to repeat
them outside of the context of court papers so that I can sue them for defamation. .. .
And I will prove beyond any doubt not only that the story is totally false, but it was
knowingly false: that the lawyers and the client conspired together to create a false
story. That is why I am moving for their disbarment in challenges to be provided to
the disciplinary committee.

Of course, there would also be an upside to Assad's demise. A brutal
regime would have fallen; Iran would be denied an Arab patron and a
critical window into Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli arena; Hamas
would likely drift further into the orbit of Egypt and Saudi Arabia;
and Hezbollah -- though hardly defanged in Lebanon -- would lose a
critical patron. At this point, however, the administration clearly
judges that the risks of U.S. action outweigh the potential benefits.
Bad options, bad outcomes. So, for now, we watch and wait to see
where the arc on the Assads is headed -- north or south. But if the

at some point resumes a business-as-usual posture with the only

Paton the back or force for good: what purpose do development awards serve?
Mark Tran — Guardian blog

Divyesh Thakkar has just returned from refugee camps in Ethiopia, where he was surprised to see portable solar lanterns
designed by his company still in use three years after their distribution.

The batteries for the prototype lamps were expected to last only two years, but were still functioning at the Jijiga camp near
the Somali border.

It's amazing they're still working and to see them changing lives, said Thakkar, who is based in Leicester. People are
going to university thanks to the lamp.

The solar lantern, which looks like an old-fashioned kerosene hurricane lamp, won an innovation award last year at AidEx,
an annual trade show bringing together suppliers and buyers of products for the aid industry. The lamp has a built-in solar
panel to charge its four AA-sized batteries.

The lantern has an obvious advantage over kerosone-fuelled equivalents: with no flame or smoke emissions, it is safer and
more environmentally friendly. The batteries are made for 500 cycles, or about two years, but the longevity of the lamps in
Ethiopia has come as a pleasant surprise. In a novel twist, the lantern, which costs $38 (£24.50), can also be used to charge
mobile phones.

The award provided a huge fillip for Thakkar's company, Sunlite. As word spread, relief agencies placed increasingly large
orders. About 100,000 of the lamps have been (or are being) used after emergencies in Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and
Syria.

Sunlite makes 15,000 lamps a month at two plants in India, including one in a special economic zone in Gujarat state.

Next month, there will be a new winner at AidEx in Brussels, the third year of the award. The innovation award sits alongside
a crowded field of honours in the development world, although AidEx is geared more towards humanitarian needs.

Awards seem to be proliferating. Last month, 53 finalists met in Washington to showcase ideas to save the lives of mothers
and newborns in developing countries. The award is given by the Saving Lives at Birth partnership, launched in 2011, which
includes USAid, Norway, Grand Challenges Canada, backed by the Canadian government, the UK's Department for
International Development, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

In October, the Mo Ibrahim foundation will announce its prize for achievement in African leadership, established in 2007.
Past winners include presidents Joaquim Chissano and Festus Gontebanye Mogae, of Mozambique and Botswana
respectively, although the prize is not awarded if no one meets the criteria.

Sceptics may wonder whether these accolades contribute meaningfully to development, or exist only to make donors feel
good while sidestepping more fundamental, structural issues. Forinstance, the Gates foundation awarded $100,000 to the
California Institute of Technology last year for designing a solar-powered toilet that breaks down water and human waste
into hydrogen gas for use in fuel cells.

The competition was for next-generation toilets to improve sanitation in the developing world. Would that money have

been better spent on supporting community-led total sanitation — a project to end open defecation that has had considerable
success?

Sloman’s demand, other than to protect prospective plaintiffs from being interviewed
prior to their retaining an attorney (including, as it tumed out, Mr. Sloman’s former law
partner) to bring civil lawsuits against Epstein.

Mr. Sloman also demanded that Epstein “begin his term of incarceration not later than
January 4, 2008,” id., which tumed out to be just three weeks before the first civil lawsuit
would be filed against Epstein.

Contrary to the express agreement of United States Attorney Acosta that the federal
government would not interfere in the administration of any state sentence, Mr. Sloman
tried to limit gain time and or work release by stating that Mr. Epstein must “make a
binding recommendation that the Court impose a sentence of 18 months of continuous
confinement in the county jail.” Jd. (This followed Mr. Sloman’s position that the Office
would consider a state sentence ordering probation in lieu of incarceration to be a breach
of the deferred-prosecution agreement.) Shortly thereafter, Mr. Sloman sent the FBI to
meet with the state sex-crimes prosecutor in an attempt to secure her commitment to
oppose work release.

Mr. Sloman insisted that Mr. Epstein not learn the identities of the government’s list of
alleged “victims” until after Epstein was sentenced and incarcerated.

We have reason to believe that, around this same time, Mr. Sloman’s former law partner,
Jeffrey Herman, had met with the father of one of the prospective plaintiffs, Saige
Gonzalez.> At the same time (and until as recently as March of 2008), the Official
Florida Bar website continued to identify Mr. Sloman as a named partner in Mr.
Herman’s firm. See Tab 31, Florida Bar Website page.

Mr. Herman, who is the named pariner in the former firm of Herman, Sloman, &
Mermelstein, filed five lawsuits, each asking for $50 million, against Mr. Epstein. Each
lawsuit is entitled “Jane Doe # vs. Jeffrey Epstein,” despite the fact that each of the
plaintiffs is an adult and not entitled to plead anonymously. See Tab 32, Examples of
Federal Complaints.

Mr. Herman convened press conferences contemporaneously with filing three of the
suits. In the most recent press conference, he admitted that all of the plaintiffs lied to
Epstein about their ages. See Tab 33, Herman Public Statement. One of the supposedly
traumatized “victims” actually pled in her complaint that she returned to Epstein’s house
“on many occasions for approximately three years.” Another of these supposedly
traumatized “victims” herself acted to introduce her friends and acquaintances to Mr.

The Justice Department rules disqualify employees from working on matters in which their former employers
have an interest: “an employee shall be disqualified for two years from participating in any particular matter
in which a former employer is a party or represents a party if he received an extraordinary payment from
that person prior to entering Government service. The two-year period of disqualification begins to run on the
date that the extraordinary payment is received.” 5 C.F.R. § 2635.503(a) (emphasis added).

US support. Yet America’s recent retreat from the region, following
clumsy attempts at nation building, has destabilized and discouraged
its allies.

Iran is supporting militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen whose stated
purpose is to eradicate Israel. That threat may create what has been a
previously unthinkable alliance between our Gulf Cooperating Council
partners and Israel. It’s in the interest of all these allies, including
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, other GCC members, along with Israel,
to join forces. That alliance would provide a countervailing balance to
the Revolutionary Guard in Iran, the ISIS caliphate and the aggressive
aspiration of Turkey, which is further fueled by a renewed Russian
push.

The competition for a caliphate has more contestants than just Iran,
including ISIS, of course, as well as Turkey, and the Muslim
Brotherhood. As the US withdraws, Russia is taking its place as the
non-Arab power player in the Middle East. The chill in US-Russia
relations has left President Putin free to defy Washington. Without
predictable US-support, our allies may have only one direction to turn
as Russia capitalizes on every USA misstep in the region.

The emerging alliance between Putin and Turkey’s Erdogan has
evolved in perfect Kissingerian fashion; sovereign relationships can be
as ephemeral as their counterparties’ interests. And now that Russia
and Turkey seem to have a growing relationship, a counterbalancing
alignment needs to be crafted between the GCC and the Arab nations.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been our longest and strongest ally
and, to many Westerners’ amazement, it is impossible for the US to
move against any hostile Islamic group anywhere in the world without
Saudi support. Almost two billion Muslims look to Mecca and Medina
as their spiritual heartland and challenging any faction of Islam
without the support of its guardian, Saudi Arabia, would be foolhardy.

Brigade” — struck wherever they could inflict the most terror, and death: at bus
stations, on buses, in shopping centers, restaurants and cafés. Over a 12-month
period, beginning with a bombing of Tel Aviv’s main bus station at the beginning
of January 2003, they murdered 145 men, women and children. It would not be
until two years’ later, with the West Bank fence in place and a range of other
security measures, that the attacks, and the deaths, were finally brought down
dramatically.

The Labor Party had finally left Arik Sharon’s coalition in late 2002. But in
Israel’s 2003 election — reverting to the old rules again, with a single vote for party
and Prime Minister — Arik and the Likud won resoundingly. They doubled their
Knesset seats, to 38. Labor, now with only 19 seats, against turned to Shimon
Peres, as interim party leader.

I didn’t miss the political limelight. But by mid-2004, with the first sign of a
major change in policy toward the Palestinians, I felt I had a contribution to make.
What first prompted me to dip my toes back into politics were the ever more
obvious signs throughout 2004 that Arik’s coalition, and his hold on the Likud,
were unraveling. Part of his problem was a steady drumbeat of corruption
allegations around what had become a kind of family political operation: Arik and
his two sons, Omri and Gilad. But Arik also seemed to be undergoing a welcome
political conversion, to the need for the more profound political “disengagement”
with the Palestinians which I’d long been advocating. He had endorsed the Bush
Administration’s “road map” for resuming the peace process. Yet with Yasir
Arafat ageing, ailing and even less inclined to consider the difficult decisions he
had shirked at Camp David, Arik went one, dramatic step further. He raised the
idea of unilaterally withdrawing Israeli forces and settlements from Gaza —
ensuring a showdown with the rank and file of the Likud, and other parties on the
right. His main Likud rival, very much back in front-line Israeli politics, was his
Finance Minister: Bibi Netanyahu. Though Bibi remained on board until the last
moment, he dramatically resigned for the cabinet in August 2005, a week before
the Gaza withdrawal, declaring: “I am not prepared to be a partner to a move
which ignores reality, and proceeds blindly toward turning the Gaza Strip into a
base for Islamic terrorism which will threaten the state.”

To this day, Bibi, along with many Israelis across the political spectrum, draws
a direct line between our pullout from Gaza, Hamas’s takeover and its violent
purging of Fatah’s old guard there, and the periodic wars we’ve had to fight since

Kosslyn on Neurobiology and the Law; a large class with Professor Steven Pinker on the subject
of Taboos; and a series of freshman seminars entitled Where Does Your Morality Come From?

My teaching and academic writing have centered on several overarching themes. Between my
earliest articles on the preventive detention of the dangerously mentally ill and my recent series of
books on the prevention of terrorism, my major academic focus has been on prediction and
prevention of harmful conduct. I’ve taught numerous classes about that and related issues. The
writings ranged from the preemption and prevention of harmful conduct by the mentally ill, to the
effort to predict which kinds of speeches and writings might lead to violence.” They included
articles and books on preventive detention of suspected terrorists, preventive interrogation and
surveillance methods designed to secure real-time intelligence information necessary to prevent
terrorism, preemptive military actions, pre-trial detention of ordinary criminals, preventive genetic
testing and inoculation, preventive character testing,~ and preventive profiling. As to all of these
issues, I have sought to balance the imperatives of due process, liberty and decency, against the
legitimate needs of national security and crime prevention. I coined the term “The Preventive
State” and have been thinking, teaching and writing about its increasing dangers for half a
century. I believe I was the first academic to focus on this problem in a systematic way.

The overt text of many of my books, articles and classes dealt in large part with the substantive
and procedural issues growing out of prediction and prevention of harmful conduct—the
movement we are experiencing toward “the preventive state’”—and the jurisprudential problems
associated with this movement. There is, however, a more subtle swbrext that runs through not
only the writings about prevention, but virtually all my other writings as well.

This subtext is the need in a democracy for openly articulated criteria and standards, whenever
states (or state-like institutions) take actions that affect the rights of individuals whether these
actions are preventive or reactive in nature. This need may seem obvious, since democracy
cannot operate in the absence of visibility and accountability. Yet in virtually all of the areas
about which I have chosen to write and teach, the criteria and standards for government action
have been unarticulated or hidden from public view. Moreover, there have been some who have
argued that it is wiser, even in a democracy, sometimes to hide from public view (and hence
public scrutiny) what the government is doing.**

Some governmental decisions and actions must, of course, be kept secret, at least for a time.
Espionage activities, weapon development, military planning and the like must, by their very
nature, be kept under wraps if they are to succeed. But broad policy decisions should, in a
democracy, be subjected to the checks and balances not only by the other branches of

wealth and hope will be more common now than in less revolutionary times. To
follow the logic of the French philosopher Paul Virilio, fora moment: The train
produced the train accident. The plane produced the plane accident'’”. Surely we can
count on the network to produce the network accident —- and many of them. In such
a world the question of what you “have” - by which I mean what you are connected
to - determines what you “are.” You have friends on a social network. The US has a
currency platform. Some new startup has an artificially intelligent machine. We all
have possibilities and vulnerabilities we only dimly understand.

The great insight of the Enlightenment was that the nature of an object - a person, a
piece of land, a vote, a share - changed when it was liberated from old fetters of
tradition, ignorance, habit or fear. That single shift triggered centuries of disruption,
of wars, of creativity and great human advance. The world realigned itself. The
Seventh Sense era will be similar. When we are connected, power shifts. It changes
who we are, what we might expect, how we might be manipulated, attacked,
enriched. It is too early to map with any real fidelity the landscape that will emerge
as a result, but we can say at least this: The nature of an object, any object, changes
when it is connected. We need to say too: We are relatively early in our age of
connection. It’s not just that so much of the world remains to be linked; it’s also that
the nature of connection itself is changing. It is becoming instant. It is increasingly
sharpened and enhanced, we will see, by the use of artificial intelligence. Basic
connection is a powerful force; instant, Al-enabled links? You can imagine it must be
something else entirely.

Let’s take as an example a tool you're using right now, the English language. Any
language is an “object” of sorts, a tool whose power depends on how and where it is
used. Just as widespread use of the dollar or the British Pound or gold - for trade,
for finance or for stashing under mattresses — marks a network of economic
exchange, so English is a mesh for information sharing. When Spanish and Lebanese
and Russian researchers gather to design a drug molecule, when astronauts talk in
the International Space Station, when bankers settle finance policy in the midst of
yet another unexpected crisis, they are using a powerful, standardized, shared tool
that makes their work possible and efficient. English in this role, like French before
it, has an appealing leverage: The more people who use it, the greater the incentive
to learn it.

But when we think of English in a network sense, we see it is more than simply an
object. It’s a means of connection, something that information scientists calla
“protocol”. You may know the word from the realm of diplomacy, where protocols
ritualize and decide everything from where the President sits at a dinner to howa
letter must be addressed. In technical terms a “protocol” is also a rulebook too.
Some network protocols you may have heard of - HTTP, DNS, SWIFT all serve as
links in this sense. They translate digital bits into organized web pages, secure

of the courage you have shown in doing what you have done, which really brings me to
the last subject, and that is what was it that motivated you to go public with all of this?

V: Sharon Richard contacted me. I like her, I do, I like her a lot. I know she’s a journalist,
and journalists are normally bloodsucking leeches, but I like her for that, but she is an
honest bloodsucking leech. She told me a lot about what was still going on, and she
showed me a picture of Jeffrey with a little girl who looks like she could have been 12
years old. I mean it was disgusting. I agreed to talk with her, I never agreed to do
anything until she showed me some pictures, and at that stage, being a mother of 3
children and having a daughter who I would do anything for to protect, I would put my
neck on the line to make sure she never has to go through what I had to go through, and
knowing all of this, and knowing that he’s still out there doing the same exact thing with
no regrets, no remorse, no worry about what he’s doing to those girls, and all those girls
feeling the same way that I did, so I, you know, I’m doing it because I believe in my heart
of hearts it’s the right thing to do. It’s what I would want somebody to do for my
daughter or my sister or my friend, and it saddens me to know that it’s still going on right
now. It’s like the seashell story. I don’t know if you’re heard the story about the little kid
who throws back a starfish, you know, the little brother tries to ask his sister, “why do
you throw them in, they’re all gonna die anyways, the little girl says “well, it’s this one
that I can help, and this one that I can help,” and that’s what I feel like I’m doing. I’m
making a small dent in this big world we live in.

JS: I certainly appreciate that courage, and I have heard that story, and you’re absolutely
right, that one person may not be able to make a difference for everyone, but one person
can make a difference for someone, and hopefully, you are making a difference for
someone, and we’re gonna do the best we can to make sure you are making a difference
for as many people as possible.

Vv: Thanks Jack.

JS: Just a few other follow up things I want to ask you and again, if any of these questions
are questions that you’re uncomfortable in responding to, then don’t hesitate to tell me
that. Do you have any recollection of Jeffrey Epstein’s specifically telling you that “Bill
Clinton owes me favors”?

Vv: Yes. I do. It was a laugh though. He would laugh it off. You know, I remember asking
Jeffrey what’s Bill Clinton doing here kind of thing, and he laughed it off and said well

he owes me a favor. He never told me what favors they were. I never knew. I didn’t
know if he was serious. It was just a joke.

The Computational Structure of Mental Representation
Joscha Bach
joscha.bach@hu-berlin.de
Berlin, February 26th, 2013
Now is the time for starting a new
Artificial Intelligence initiative.
What is the mind?
–this is arguably the most
interesting question that
our species can ask itself.
Last month, a grand proposal by Barack Obama made headlines
everywhere in the world: He suggested a large-­‐scale initiative
to create a detailed map of the activity of the human brain, at
the level of individual neurons. This idea is quite similar to (and
likely inspired by) Henry Markram’s Blue Brain project in
Lausanne, which recently won a 1.5Bn grant from the European
Union. While this is an interesting project in its own right, it
will not address the key question of cognitive science:
What is the mind? What are the building blocks and
fundamental operations of thinking and perception?
Here, I would like to suggest the instigation of a project that is
at once more ambitious, more narrowly targeted, and likely to
yield more profound theoretical, practical and cultural insights
than the Brain Activity Mapping initiative: The study of the
computational structure of mental representation.
Mental representation, not
neurons will inform the
core our understanding of
cognition.
Cognition is incidentally enabled by human nervous systems,
but in its nature, it is not a chemical, biological or physiological
phenomenon. Instead, cognitive systems are a class of
information processing systems, thinking is a set of certain,
functionally identifiable operations, over certain, functionally
identifiable types of representations, and with respect to a set
of problems and properties given by certain environments.
Thus, the Structure of Mental Representation initiative should
focus on mental content, with all its dynamic, relational,
conceptual, and linguistic elements, and it’s grounding in
perception and interaction.
2
The study of mental
representations requires a
new scientific discipline
Integrating concepts from
linguistics, cognitive
psychology and
neuroscience within the
methodological framework
of constructionist Artificial
Intelligence
A new common ground
between AI and cognitive
science researchers
Unraveling mental representations will be an interdisciplinary
effort among several cognitive sciences, but distinct from the
disciplines that we find now:
The project will differ from linguistics, for instance, in similar
way as geography differs from plate tectonics. Where linguists
study the intrinsic ‘geography’ of languages, and the structural
commonalities among them, mental representations uncover
the underlying dynamics that produce natural languages (as
the solutions to the problem of translating between
hierarchical, distributed, associative, ambiguous
representations and the discrete strings of symbols that we use
as a means of exchanging and organizing ideas).
Mental representations lie outside the domain of neuroscience,
which mostly focuses on material descriptions of the function
of the underlying substrate. They cannot be studied well within
contemporary psychology, which favors an experimentalist,
quantitative approach, where we need to address qualitative
questions by constructing working, implementable systems.
And needless to say, the study of mental representations is
currently not well represented in Artificial Intelligence
research, which does provide a productive methodology, but
has mostly turned towards applications and narrow AI
solutions.
Despite the lack of a common methodological ground between
the cognitive sciences, we can now observe a growing
consensus on how to approach the problem of modeling the
mind, and its representational apparatus. During the last
decade, a number of initiatives have sprung up within AI,
psychology and cognitive science, each with journals,
workshops and conference series, and a large personal overlap
among each community. Examples include Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures
(BICA), Cognitive Systems, and Cognitive Modeling (ICCM).
Among those groups, there is an emerging consensus on
several paradigms:
-­‐
-­‐
-­‐
Integrated architectures of cognition. We need to study
whole, working systems, both for the purpose of
comparison between approaches, but mainly, because
cognition is not the product of the activity of individual
modular functions, but of the interaction between them.
Universal representations. Representations must provide
both distributed and localist aspects, to enable neural
learning, information retrieval via spreading activation, as
well as symbolic processing (language and planning).
Perceptual grounding. Representations should be
grounded in an environmental interaction context, using a
bottom-­‐up/top-­‐down perception paradigm, to allow for
3
open-­‐ended autonomous learning and language
acquisition.
-­‐
-­‐
-­‐
-­‐
-­‐
Integration of perception and action. Environmental
interaction is (at least partially) a control process that
requires a modeling of the relationship between sensory
data and operations performed by the system.
(Semi-­‐) Universal problem solving, enabling paradigms
of learning, planning, reasoning, analogies, language
acquisition and reflection.
A structured memory, including provisions for a
world/situation model, a protocol of environmental
interactions, procedural memory, declarative and
typological abstractions, a model of self, and a 'mental
stage', to facilitate anticipation and planning.
Decision making and motivational mechanisms, to
address both autonomous, goal-­‐directed cognition in
complex, open domains, and the genesis of goals and
intentions.
The direction and modulation of attention, and the
emergence of emotion and affect, which are
configurational aspects of cognition that either reflect the
allocation of cognitive resources, or structure social
interaction.
Constraints for Mental Representations
Based on the emergent paradigm of a new generation of
cognitive architectures, we can think about mental
representations in a new and productive way. More specifically,
we know that mental representations include perceptual and
propositional/conceptual content and we are aware of many
constraints. Mental representations must
-­‐
-­‐
-­‐
-­‐
-­‐
-­‐
Offer support for both connectionist and symbolic
processing (including compositionality and grammatical
structures), with the latter one being a special case of the
former
Possess a hierarchical structure, bottoming out in
sensory perception
Cover prototypes, individuals and abstractions
Include perceptual and relational features, objects,
situations, and episodic knowledge
Allow simulation of dynamic processes
Solve the bridge problem between fuzzy associative
hierarchies and the discrete symbol strings of natural
language
4
Creating a scientific community
Operations on these representations include reinforcement
learning and classification, perceptual top-­‐down/bottom-­‐up
processing, abstraction, analogy formation, associative and
syllogistic reasoning, planning, reflection, anticipation and
several modes of reorganization.
The task of the Structure of Mental Representation initiative will
at first consist in the creation of a large and competitive
community, built around a set of benchmark problems.
I suggest picking a set of problems that covers most of the
above architectural requirements: the comprehension of
dynamic visual sequences (movies) and narratives. The
evaluation of comprehension may focus both on a discourse
level (asking the system general and specific questions about
the consumed visuals or narratives) and directly, by producing
dynamic renderings and depictions of knowledge represented
within the system. At least on the discourse level, a direct
comparison to the functional properties of child performance
at different cognitive stages is possible.
The Comprehension
Challenge
Turning the benchmark task into a regular competition allows a
direct comparison between models, and offers a strong
incentive for exchange of solutions among research groups. The
need to for broad solutions with given material and intellectual
resources will enforce a higher degree of the reuse of code and
ideas than we currently see in AI architectures (outside of
robotic soccer, where such competitions have turned out to be
highly successful).
The Formation of a Pilot Team
By structuring the comprehension tasks into different levels
and sub-­‐domains (such as basic language acquisition tasks,
grammar, perceptual and logical tasks, social reasoning/theory
of mind, affective evaluation, constructive problem solving, use
of analogies and metaphor etc.), we can formulate consistent
long-­‐term goals and realistic short-­‐term problems.
To pull the Structure of Mental Representation initiative off the
ground, we will need to create a pilot team, which is the object
of this proposal. The pilot team has the following tasks:
-­‐
-­‐
-­‐
Bring a critically sized group of people together, with a
well-­‐defined set of shared goals
Formulate an initial set of hypotheses
Bring these in the context of an existing or hypothetical
cognitive architecture, so specifications can be derived
5
-­‐
Build an initial software infrastructure for testing
benchmark problems, and to create a common
methodological ground
Composition of a pilot
team
The pilot team should consist of a scientific board, including a
mutually compatible sub-­‐set of contemporary thinkers in the
field. Its core should consist of a new generation of researchers
that have the resources and impetus to work full-­‐time on the
design, implementation and publication of the project’s
infrastructure. The initial team size should not be large, but
agile and effective (I would suggest about five permanent
researchers, about the same number of dedicated software
developers, and 2–3 slots for visiting scientists at a time).
The initial duration should be about 2.5 years, followed be an
evaluation, and a possible continuation of similar length.
Possible candidates for the scientific board include (in no
particular order) Paul Rosenbloom (who worked with Alan
Newell on the cognitive architecture Soar, and now started a
new architecture), John Sowa (well-­‐known for his
groundbreaking work in semantic networks), Ben Goertzel
(designer of the cognitive architecture OpenCog), Luc Steels (an
AI researcher studying the emergence of natural language in
communities of software agents), Jerome Feldman (who
devised building blocks for a Neural Theory of Language),
Stephen Pinker (who thought much about the relationship
between language and mental representation), Stephen
Kosslyn (an expert on the psychology of mental
representation), Daniel Dennet, Cristiano Castelfranchi (an AI
researcher specializing on mental representations of intentions
and social context), and many others.
The project should start out with a number of kickoff
meetings to invite the interaction between suitable candidates,
and the formation of a core group. The eventual pilot team
could be located in many possible places, however, the project
should be able to draw on the vicinity of academic and other
infrastructure, and the influence of a creative environment.
About me (Joscha Bach):
Driven by an interest to learn hot the mind works, I studied philosophy
and psychology, graduated in computer science/artificial intelligence, lead
several small academic research groups, built the cognitive architecture
MicroPsi and obtained a PhD in cognitive science. I co-­‐founded a couple of
startup companies in Berlin, but turned back towards academia to
contribute to the question of how to build a mind.

Jeffrey and Ghislaine: Notes on New York's Oddest Alliance 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/03/notes- on-new-yorks-oddest- couple-j effrey- ep stein- and-
ghislaine-maxwell.html > 
by Vicky Ward <http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/vicky- ward> 
March 8, 2011, 2:30 PM 
I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. 
You will never think the same way about anything again. 
So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up 
everywhere at the moment as the alleged procurer of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of 
another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with 
allegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British 
newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to 
publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called The Talented Mr. Epstein. It was largely a business piece that 
focused on his mysterious exit from Bear Steams in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les 
Wexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude 
Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of 
$450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women 
with whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the 
issue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I 
concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same 
ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one 
case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: 
Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity 
Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030578 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept 
running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of 
young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. Do they speak? I remember 
asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. Not like you,Vicky, was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I 
hadn't studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a 
package at home via messenger. It was a book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He 
was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few 
moments in his company and you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that 
Andy—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his 
strange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what 
he's talking about far more than Andy does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other 
financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours 
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is 
curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent 
me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even 
Rupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill 
Clinton with whom she is close friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-
Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When 
it comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her 
vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; 
inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect 
replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his 
sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving 
a massive black hole he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that 
strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful 
people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, 
and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't 
tend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't 
quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second wife for many years whose existence he has 
been open about. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030579 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her 
loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. 
Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up 
for all sorts of blemishes.

Tinker

It’s like the boiling frog. You get exposed to a little bit of evil,
a little bit of rule-breaking, a little bit of dishonesty ... you can
come to justify it.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2014

DWARD JOSEPH SNOWDEN was born on June 21, 1983, in Eliza-

beth City, North Carolina. His parents were Lon Snowden and
Elizabeth “Wendy” Barrett. According to their marriage records,
they wed when they were both eighteen in 1979. The following year
they had a daughter, Jessica.

Lon Snowden, like his father before him, served in the U.S. Coast
Guard. He was stationed at its main aviation base, where his father-
in-law, Edward Joseph Barrett, was an officer and rising star of the
Coast Guard. While Edward Snowden was still a child, his maternal
grandfather would become not only an admiral but also head of the
Coast Guard’s entire aviation service.

When Lon was transferred to a Coast Guard base near Baltimore
in 1992, he bought a two-story house in Crofton, Maryland, a resi-
dential community very close to the NSA’s headquarters building
at Fort Meade. Edward, who was nine, and Jessica, who was twelve,
were enrolled in local public schools in Crofton.

Jessica was a top student. After she obtained her degree at the

deals honestly with the people, and a country that
lives at peace with its neighbors.

The Ukraine factor

The falsification of history that began during the early
years of Putin's leadership has been intensified in the
wake of the invasion of Ukraine and seizure of Crimea
in 2014. To convince the Russian people that waging
a form of low-intensity warfare against a neighbor was
justified, Putin has stepped up efforts to depict the
West as antagonistic to Russian interests, launched

a campaign to label those responsible for Ukraine's
Maidan uprising as fascists, driven home the idea that
ethnic Russians living outside the Russian Federation
were under relentless persecution, and identified
Russian critics of aggression against Ukraine as a
treasonous fifth column.

A recurring theme of post-Crimea propaganda is the
notion that Russia faces the same threats from the
West today as it did during the Cold War. To make this
point, Russian television aired a documentary meant to
justify one of the more shameful events of the Soviet
period, the 1968 Soviet-led Warsaw Pact intervention in
Czechoslovakia. The invasion was undertaken to crush
the reformist Prague Spring movement, whose leaders
were moving increasingly in the direction of jettisoning
state socialism, embracing democratic reforms, and
seeking a kind of neutral geopolitical status much like
that enjoyed at the time by Austria. The documentary
used archival footage to build a concocted case that
the invasion was necessary to thwart a NATO-inspired
coup in Prague.'° The clear purpose of the film was to
portray NATO as a permanent threat to Russian inter-
ests, as much in 2014 as in 1968.

Another television documentary focused on the sei-
zure of Crimea, a year after the event. As Lucian Kim
has noted, the program is something of a celebration
of the tactics of dictatorship. The filmmakers offer no
conflicting opinions and present American leaders
as puppet masters. Among other claims, the docu-
mentary asserts that Washington gave the Maidan
forces information about Ukrainian security methods
that American officials had obtained during bilateral
exchange programs with the Kyiv government. !%

To further bolster the case for the invasion of Ukraine,
the Russian propaganda machinery devoted great
energy to demonstrating the fascist nature of the
Maidan, relying heavily on invocations of Soviet
history. The Ukrainian protesters and activists who
helped drive out corrupt president Viktor Yanukovych,

and the European-oriented politicians who replaced
him, were repeatedly labeled as present-day followers
of Stepan Bandera, a controversial nationalist leader
who fought the Soviets and at times cooperated with
the Nazis in a doomed campaign for an independent
Ukraine during World War II. Russian media presented
Bandera and his followers as unambiguous allies of
the Nazis, and highlighted their wartime atrocities.
Russian media also featured a number of documenta-
ries that emphasized Russian, as opposed to Soviet,
resistance to Hitler. The objective was to equate
contemporary Ukrainians who favored full sovereignty
and independence from Russian influence with Nazi
collaborators and pogromists. This served not only

to explain Moscow's response, but also to deter any
emulation of the Maidan protests in Russia itself.

The assault on academic freedom

Since the occupation of Crimea and invasion of east-
ern Ukraine, it has become increasingly dangerous
to express dissenting views on Russian foreign policy
in Russias schools and universities. Putin mace the
point quite clearly in a speech before the parliament
in March 2014, when he referred to a “fifth column”
and a “disparate bunch of national traitors” sowing
discord within Russia.®

In the ensuing months, anyone criticizing Russian pol-
icy risked the label of foreign agent, which in Russian
usage is tantamount to being called a spy. Around

this time a new website called Predatel (traitor) began
listing alleged traitors, specifically those who had
criticized Russia's annexation of Crimea or supported
sanctions against Russian officials. The site encour-
aged Russians to send in the names of other traitors.

Meanwhile, a number of educators fell afoul of the

new policies on the teaching of history. In March 2014,
Andrey Zubov, who held a position at the Moscow State
Institute of International Relations, was fired for “an im-
moral act—namely an article he published in the news-
paper Vedomosti that criticized the seizure of Crimea
and compared it to Hitler's annexation of Austria. “We
must not behave the way the Germans once behaved,
based on the promises of Goebbels and Hitler,” he
wrote. The university's explanation claimed that Zubov's
writings “contradict Russias foreign policy and inflict
careless, irresponsible criticism on the actions of the
state.”’ In a similar incident, senior sociologist Aleksan-
dr Konkov was let go by Sakhalin State University after
declaring that Russia had seized Crimea opportunisti-
cally because Ukraine was weak, not because Crimeans
themselves had clamored for the takeover.!®

— Example task: If Ruiting is normally seen near Shuo, then if the robot knows where
Shuo is, that is where it should look when asked to find Ruiting

6. Planning

e Tactical
— Example task: The robot is asked to bring the red ball to the teacher, but the red
ball is in the corner where the robot can’t reach it without a tool like a stick. The
robot knows a stick is in the cabinet so it goes to the cabinet and opens the door
and gets the stick, and then uses the stick to get the red ball, and then brings the
red ball to the teacher.
e Strategic
— Example task: Suppose that Matt comes to the lab infrequently, but when he does
come he is very happy to see new objects he hasn’t seen before (and suppose the
robot likes to see Matt happy). Then when the robot gets a new object Matt has
not seen before, it should put it away in a drawer and be sure not to lose it or let
anyone take it, so it can show Matt the object the next time Matt arrives.
e Physical
— Example task: To pick up a cup with a handle which is lying on its side in a position
where the handle can’t be grabbed, the robot turns the cup in the right position
and then picks up the cup by the handle
® Social
— Example task: The robot is given a job of building a tower of blocks by the end of
the day, and he knows Ben is the most likely person to help him, and he knows that
Ben is more likely to say yes to helping him when Ben is alone. He also knows
that Ben is less likely to say yes if he’s asked too many times, because Ben doesn’t
like being nagged. So he waits to ask Ben till Ben is alone in the lab.

in front of it in the preschool) and identify the key objects in the scene and their
relationships.
e Social Attention
— Example task: The robot is having a conversation with Itamar, which is giving the
robot reward (for instance, by teaching the robot useful information). Conversations
with other individuals in the room have not been so rewarding recently. But Itamar
keeps getting distracted during the conversation, by talking to other people, or
playing with his cellphone. The robot needs to know to keep paying attention to
Itamar even through the distractions.
e Behavioral Attention
— Example task: The robot is trying to navigate to the other side of a crowded room
full of dynamic objects, and many interesting things keep happening around the
room. The robot needs to largely ignore the interesting things and focus on the
movements that are important for its navigation task.

e Ifthe same thing (i.e., sexual abuse of minor girls) had happened in New York, he
(Epstein) would have received only a $200 fine;

e Bradley J. Edwards was the one causing all of Epstein’s problems (i.e., the civil
suits brought by Jane Doe and other girls);

e L.M. came to him as a prostitute and a drug user (1.e., came to Epstein for sex,
rather than Epstein pursuing her);

¢ All the girls suing him are only trying to get a meal ticket;

e The only thing he might have done wrong was to maybe cross the line a little too
closely;

e He (Epstein) was very upset that Edwards had subpoenaed Ghisline Maxwell, that
she was a good person that did nothing wrong (i.¢e., had done nothing wrong even
though she helped procure young girls to satisfy Epstein’s sexual desires);

e With regard to Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein, which involved an allegation that Epstein
had repeatedly sexually abused a 15-year-old girl, forced her to have sex with his
friends, and flew her on his private plane nationally and internationally for the
purposes of sexually molesting and abusing her, he (Epstein) flippantly said that
the case was dismissed, indicating that the allegations were ridiculous and untrue.

See Affidavit of Michael J. Fisten attached hereto as Exhibit “QQ.”

81. The Rush interview also demonstrated perjury (a federal crime) on the part of
Epstein. Epstein lied about not knowing George Rush. See Epstein Deposition, February 17,
2010, taken in L.M. v. Jeffrey Epstein, case 50-2008-CA-028051, page 154, line 4 through 155
line 9, (Deposition -attachment #7), wherein Jeffrey Epstein clearly impresses that he does not
recognize George Rush from the New York Daily News. This impression was given despite the

fact that he gave a lengthy personal interview about details of the case that was tape recorded

with George Rush.

invading units with their traditional welcome, showering them with rice. But for
anew Shiite militia calling itself Hizbollah — formed after the invasion and
inspired by the Ayatollah Khomeini’s revolution in Iran — our continuing
military presence was anathema. In November 1983, Hizbollah signalled its
intentions when a truck bomber drove into a building being used as our military
headquarters in the south Lebanese city of Tyre, killing more than 60 people.

Yet the election ended up as a near-tie. Peres did lead Labor back into top
spot for the first time since Begin’s victory in 1977. But he got only 44 seats, to
the Likud’s 41. After weeks of horse-trading with smaller parties, he could not
form a government. Neither could Shamir. The result, for the first time in
peacetime, was a national-unity coalition, including both main parties. Peres
would be Prime Minister for the first two years, and Shamir the final two. But
the stipulation of most relevance to me was that one man would be the Defence
Minister throughout the four years: Yitzhak Rabin.

My relationship with Rabin went back much further than with Misha. I'd
first met him when I was a sayeret soldier. I’d interacted with him more as
sayeret commander, and of course during Entebbe. Now, we began to work
even more closely, and the main challenge in his early months as Defense
Minister was what to do about our troops in Lebanon. We had gradually been
pulling back. We were more or less on the 40-kilometer line which Sharon had
claimed was the point of the invasion. But even this was costing us lives, with
no obvious benefit from controlling a large slab of territory on which nearly
half-a-million Lebanese lived. A decision was now reached to shrink our
“security zone” further, pulling back to the Litani River. It meandered about 25
kilometers north of the border, and in some areas was even closer to Israel.

I argued strongly in favor of getting out altogether. I accepted that the
“Litani line” might help impede cross-border raids. But especially since the
remaining Palestinian fighters and Hizbollah were acquiring newer Katyushas,
with a range of up to 20 kilometers, they could fire rockets over the security
zone. My deeper concern was that we intended to hold the area with between
1,000 and 1,500 Israeli troops in open alliance with a local Maronite Christian
militia, called the South Lebanon Army. This would rule out any hope of
working out security arrangements with the non-Christian majority in the south.
I tried to persuade Rabin we should withdraw all the Israeli soldiers and
coordinate security arrangements with the equivalent of a local civil-defense
guard. I suggested four separate militias drawn from the local population —

he was a 23-year-old political operative. They have lunch once a
week, where sometimes—as on the details of Af-Pak escalation—
they cordially disagree but know the president will decide anyway.
Donilon believes you have to go back to George H. W. Bush’s era to
find such “alignment” among national-security principals. “She’s a
great team player,” he says.

The biggest problem between State and the White House used to be
that Cheryl Mills, Hillary’s chief of staff, clashed with Denis
McDonough, the deputy national-security adviser, who is close
personally to the president. Now the two remind staffers of an old
married couple that quarrel harmlessly. A more significant source of
tension is that Hillary has long wanted the president to do more
outreach to heads of state. If she had her way, the White House would
have held three times as many state dinners and bilateral meetings
with foreign leaders in the last two years. That might have helped
with all the fence-mending and coalition-building to come.

Smart Power

Being secretary of state isn’t as much fun as it sounds. Imagine
having to spend your days saying things like “We must also renew
our efforts toward a settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh based on basic
principles elaborated under the auspices of the Minsk Group.” That’s
Hillary’s life.

Once she accepted the post, she consulted all the living secretaries of
state and lots of experts on what she could get done at Foggy Bottom.
I ask her what they advised, hoping to get a little closer to how she
defines success. “They told me, “You can either concentrate on a few
big issues that will really make your mark, like China policy, or you
can try to better manage the State Department and USAID’”—the
United States Agency for International Development, the
department’s famously dysfunctional development arm that

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024073.txt,"certain factors beyond the control of the portfolio company and the General Partner. The
economic environment for all companies, and in particular for healthcare technology and start-
up companies, may remain challenging. Business risks may be more significant in portfolio
companies embarking on a build-up or operating turnaround strategy and in smaller or
development stage portfolio companies. All portfolio companies may face intense competition,
changing business and economic conditions, risks of technological acceptance and obsolescence
or other developments that may adversely affect their performance.

Illiquidity of Portfolio Investments

Investments by the Fund generally will be illiquid securities acquired through privately
negotiated transactions. The Fund may be unable to realize its investment objectives by sale or
other disposition at attractive prices or will otherwise be unable to complete an exit strategy.
External factors beyond the General Partner’s control, such as overall economic conditions, the
competitive environment and the availability of potential acquirors of the Fund’s interests in
portfolio companies may shorten or lengthen the Fund’s holding period in such portfolio
companies. In some cases, the Fund may be prohibited by contract from selling such securities
for a period of time or otherwise may be restricted from the disposition of such securities.

Lack of Operating History

The Fund and the General Partner are newly formed entities, and, accordingly have no
operating history or investments upon which investors can evaluate the potential performance
of the Fund. The prior performance of the Fund Managers or their investments as described in
this Memorandum is not necessarily indicative of the Fund’s future results. There can be no
assurance that investments by the Fund will achieve returns comparable to the historical
performance reflected in this Memorandum, and in any event, the returns achieved by the Fund
will be subject to the Management Fee and the General Partner’s carried interest. Any given
investment made by the Fund may prove to be worthless, and there is a risk that investors
could lose money.

No Assurance of Profit or Distributions

The Fund’s task of identifying opportunities in private and public operating companies,
managing such investments and realizing a significant return for investors is difficult. Many
organizations operated by persons of competence and integrity have been unable to make,
manage and realize such investments successfully. There is no assurance that the investments
of the Fund will be profitable or that any distribution will be made to the Limited Partners.
Any return on investment to the Limited Partners will depend upon successful investments
being made by the Fund. The marketability and value of any such investment will depend
upon many factors beyond the control of the Fund. The Fund may not have sufficient cash
available to make tax distributions to the Partners. The expenses of the Fund may exceed its
income, and the Limited Partners could lose the entire amount of their contributed capital.
Accordingly, prospective investors should not subscribe to the Fund unless they can readily
bear the consequences of such a loss.

Competition

The business of identifying, structuring and implementing venture capital investments, along
with other investments within the strategy of NLV-III is highly competitive. The Fund will be
competing for investments against other groups, including institutional investors, investment
managers and industrial groups owned by large and well-capitalized investors. It is possible

she says conspired in massages |

Jane Doe,’ 17, sues in state court
after dropping a federal suit.

By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

WEST PALM BEACH — A former Palm
Beach Community College student who
police say procured underage girls to give
Jeffrey Epstein sexual massages at his Palm
Beach mansion, and Epsteii’s personal assis-
tant have been sued along with Epstein over
their alleged conduct.

The girl behind the lawsuit was 14 years
old when she contends he engaged in sexual
conduct with her after she went to his water
front home in 2005 to give him a massage.
Her lawsuit, filed under the name Jane Doe,

seeks unspecified damages from Epstein for’

sexual assault and intentional infliction of
emotional distress.

She also sued Epstein, Haley Robson of
Loxahatchee and Sarah Kellen of New York
City on grounds of conspiracy and civil rack
eteering.

“We just want a full measure of justice for
this girl,” said her attorney, Ted Leopold.

Robson, who attended Palm Beach Com-
munity College, was paid by Epstein to bring

girls to his mansion for massages and more,’

according to Palm Beach police. “I'm like a
Heidi Fleiss,” they said she told them. Her
attornéy could not be reached immediately
for comment.

Kellen was an Epstein personal assistant
who arranged the encounters, even escort-
jing the girls to his massage room, police
* Tleged.

“These two conspired with”
him to help with the criminal
enterprise,” Leopold said.

Jane Doe, through her
father and stepmother, filed
/ a federal lawsuit against’
~’@ Epstein in January. She dis-

“A, missed: it after her mother
aa? said she wasn’t consulted
Epstein . about the litigation and
sought to intervene. The -:
mother is acting on her daughter's behalf in §
the latest lawsuit. ;

Epstein’s lawyer has denied the girls al-
legations and said her family is simply at |
tempting to get money from a very rich man.
Epstein, 55, is a Manhattan money manager +
who has homes there, in New Mexico andthe ,
Virgin Islands, in addition to his $8.5 million
Palm. Beach mansion.

Two other Jane Does have sued Epstein |
in federal court this year, making similar al- < -

ete ae te ene a tee, amd

_legations to those of the first Jane Doe. Those

cases remain active.

Also pending against Epstein in state court
is a felony charge of solicitation of prostitu-
tion arising from the same alleged incidents
with several girls. That case is set for‘ trial in
July, two years, after he was indicted.

* Jané Doe's new lawsuit, filed in Palm Beach
County. Circuit Court, is the most explicit in
detailing Epstein’s alleged misconduct. It is
the only suit to ihclude Robson and Kellen
as defendants, and the only one to make con-
spiracy and racketeering allegations.

Jane Doe will turn 18 in May. She lives with
other family members in Palm Beach County, :
is nearing graduation from high school and is
working part time, Leopold said. i

Certain ERISA Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as

Considerations: amended (“ERISA”), fiduciaries of prospective investors that
are retirement plans subject to ERISA (“ERISA Plans”) must
determine that an investment in the Fund is prudent, that such
investment satisfies the requirement that plan assets be
diversified and that such investment complies with the other
requirements applicable to ERISA Plans. The General Partner
intends to conduct the operations of the Fund so that it will be
an appropriate investment for ERISA Plans. In particular, the
General Partner will use reasonable best efforts to conduct the
affairs and operations of the Fund in such a manner so that the
assets of the Fund will not be treated as “plan assets” of any
ERISA Plan for purposes of ERISA. Prospective investors that
are ERISA Plans are advised to consult their own advisors as to
the effect of ERISA (or other applicable law) on an investment in
the Fund. The fiduciary of each prospective ERISA Plan
investor must independently determine that the Fund is an
appropriate investment for such ERISA Plan, taking into
account the fiduciary’s obligations under ERISA and the facts
and circumstances of each investing ERISA Plan. (See Section X,
“Certain Tax and ERISA Considerations.”)

U.S. Tax-Exempt Investors: Prospective investors are advised to consult their own tax
advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in the
Fund. Subject to certain exceptions, the General Partner will use
reasonable best efforts to conduct the affairs of the Fund in a
manner that is not expected to cause any tax- exempt partner to
realize any “unrelated business taxable income” within the
meaning of Sections 512 through 514 of the Code. (See Section
X, “Certain Tax and ERISA Considerations.”) The General
Partner’s undertaking will be deemed satisfied with respect to
the making, holding or disposing of any portfolio investment if
the tax exempt U.S. Partners are given the opportunity to (or if
all Limited Partners are otherwise required to) hold their
proportionate shares of such portfolio investment directly or
indirectly through an alternative investment vehicle treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Non-U.S. Investors: Prospective investors are advised to consult their own tax
advisors as to the tax consequences of an investment in the
Fund. Subject to certain exceptions, the General Partner will use
commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the affairs of the

twelfth among all the Chinese websites in the United States. Its reporting hews closely

to China’s official media:

¢ Example 1: On June 27, 2017, the US Department of State, in its annual Trafficking
in Persons Report 2017, put China at Tier 3, the lowest class. In reporting this
news, SinovisionNet simply reposted comments from the official website of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China attacking the human rights record of the
United States.'

e Example 2: In March 2017, the US State Department published its 2016 Human
Rights Report. SinovisionNet published two stories on this topic. One reported
the reaction to the story by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The other story
came from Xinhua, which was highly critical of the US human rights situation.
SinovisionNet also published two reports by the Information Office of the State
Council of China on America’s human rights record. It did not publish State

Department’s human rights report.’

e Example 3: On the tensions in the South China Sea, almost all the stories posted
on SinovisionNet are from official Chinese media outlets and websites. They are

naturally critical of US actions in that area.?

Qiaobao and the Sino American Times

Qiaobao, or the China Press (#%, http://www.uschinapress.com), is the flagship
pro-PRC newspaper published in the United States. Its website ranks forty-first among
all the Chinese websites in the United States. Qiaobao was established in 1990. It is
headquartered in New York City with branches in twelve major metropolitan areas of
the United States. The Sino American Times (HN) is a free paper and not a major

media presence in the United States.

Independent Media

Over the course of the last decade, most of the independent Chinese-language media
outlets in the United States have been taken over by businessmen sympathetic to the
PRC.

II. The Justice Department's Unpersuasive Position

Despite the CVRA's broad remedial purposes, its expansive language referring to investigations, and the unanimous case law
extending rights to victims prior to defendants being charged, the OLC released a memorandum in 2011 concluding that CVRA
rights attach only from the time that criminal proceedings are initiated (by complaint, information, or indictment). 8? OLC's
analysis is unpersuasive. Although OLC's opinion [*76] invokes the CVRA's definition of crime victim, its legislative intent,
and its structure, a closer reading of each demonstrates little support for the notion that crime victims must await the formal
filing of charges before accruing CVRA rights.

A. OLC'S MISREADING OF THE CVRA'S DEFINITION OF VICTIM

OLC's lead argument is that the CVRA's definition of victim presupposes that criminal charges have been formally filed.
The CVRA defines a victim who is protected as a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a
Federal offense. °4 Focusing on the word offense, OLC concedes that it does not conclusively resolve the question of
when rights attach. Nevertheless, OLC claims that the word naturally suggests that a person's status as a crime victim’ can
only be determined after there has been a formal decision to charge a defendant with a particular Federal offense. °° OLC
goes on to elaborate:

Under this reading, the earliest that a crime victim under the Act could be identified would be upon the filing of a criminal
complaint - that is, at the earliest point at which there is a sworn written statement of probable cause to believe that a particular
defendant committed an identified Federal offense and hence the first point at which it is possible with any certainty to identify
a crime victim directly and proximately harmed by the commission of that offense. °°

OLC is disingenuous in asserting that the first point at which a person has been harmed by a federal crime arises only after a
criminal complaint has been filed. The Department routinely makes such determinations at earlier points in criminal cases, such
as when it sends a target letter to a defense attorney during a grand jury investigation. 87 Indeed, OLC remarkably ignores
the fact that the Department is directly required to identify victims of a crime before the filing of a criminal complaint, both by
statute and through internal policy directives.

The Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA) °° requires the Department to identify victims before the filing of a
criminal complaint. [*77] Passed in 1990, the VRRA provided crime victims with a set of procedural rights similar to those
found in the CVRA, along with rights to notification about victim services. °° In 2004, the CVRA repealed and replaced the
section of the VRRA listing procedural rights, while leaving other parts of the VRRA intact. °° Under the remaining parts of

Medicaid: Observations

e 49 million (26MM low-income children / 12MM low-income adults /7MM
disabled / 4MM elderly) Americans (16% of population) received an
average of $4,684 in tax-payer funded payments from the federal
government for healthcare in 2009. For context, $6,872 in healthcare
benefits is 13% of average annual per-capita income for Americans.

e When Medicaid was created in 1965 to provide health insurance to low-
income Americans, 1 in 50 Americans received Medicaid, now 1 in 6
Americans receives Medicaid.

e That said, Medicaid is an important benefit for recipients as it provides
access to healthcare for low-income adults and their children. In recent
years, Medicaid beneficiaries and benefit payments have risen faster than
population and per-capita income growth owing to expanded coverage,
economic difficulties and associated sluggish wage growth for low- and
lower-middle-income families, and continued healthcare cost inflation.

m U.S. Legalized Cannabis Market Forecast

Forecast Methodology

The cannabis industry is driven by consumers, similar to other highly regulated industries such as alco-
hol, tobacco and pharmaceuticals. Consequently, our methodology for forecasting the U.S. legalized
cannabis market is based primarily on the following factors: (i) the number of eligible U.S. consumers,
grouped by age; (ii) the penetration rate for each consumer age group; and (iii) the average monthly
spending for each consumer age group.

We believe that the variable which will most impact the future size of the U.S. legalized cannabis
market is the federal legalization process. How and when federal legalization occurs will impact other
primary drivers of the market, including the number of eligible consumers, penetration rates and con-
sumer spending. We predict six developments relating to federal legalization: (1) the FDA will begin
approving individual pharmaceutical-grade drugs derived from cannabis; (2) more states will adopt
medical cannabis laws; (3) more states will adopt recreational laws; (4) the FDA will adopt routine
approval procedures for drugs with extracts of low-THC/high-CBD cannabis varieties; (5) the FDA
will adopt routine approval procedures for drugs with extracts of high-THC cannabis varieties; and
(6) cannabis parts and derivatives will be removed from the CSA schedules (either incrementally, start-
ing with CBD, or all at once) and will be fully legal for medical and recreational purposes. (We expand
on these predicted developments in Chapter IV, U.S. Legal Landscape.)

We do not predict that these developments necessarily will occur in the order presented. We do
expect some of them to develop in parallel, and none of them depends fundamentally on any other.
For example, Congress could cause development (6) at any time by passing legislation that removes
cannabis from the CSA schedules and establishes a national framework for recreational and medical
cannabis regulation. Developments (1) through (3) largely reflect incremental developments within the
existing legal environment. We do not expect developments (4), (5) or (6) to occur during the current
presidential term, but we believe that there is a reasonable chance development (4) could begin within
the next five years and development (5) could occur within two years thereafter. In total, we believe that
it could take up to 10 years or more before the federal legalization process reaches development (6) and
cannabis becomes fully legal under federal law. For our analysis, we assume (i) development (4) begins
in 2023, (ii) development (5) follows two years thereafter and (iii) development (6) occurs by 2027 and
cannabis becomes fully legal in the United States. (The reader is cautioned that cannabis may never be
legalized federally in the United States.)

Eligible U.S. Consumers

We used U.S. Census data to identify the number of people in the United States aged 21 years or
older. While some therapeutic applications of cannabis are targeted at people under 21 years of age, we
excluded this group of consumers from our estimates. We assumed a nominal annual growth rate for
the U.S. population. With more than 97% of the U.S. population currently living in a state or district
with at least one law that permits the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing or possession of cannabis
or concentrates, we view the potential pool of eligible consumers to be virtually the entire U.S. adult
population.

chines, with their vast patronage networks, that pre-
sided over American cities a half-century ago. Fidesz
is apparently seeking to ensure that rival parties will
never have access to the funds or influence necessary
to unseat the incumbent government.

ls Orban a Central European version of Putin?
Orban's domestic critics have often compared his
governing style to that of Russian president Vladimir
Putin. On the surface, the comparison seems unfair.
Hungary is still rated Free by Freedom House. It still
has genuine opposition parties, however weak, in
parliament, a relatively unfettered civil society sector,
freedom of assembly, and other civil liberties. Hungary

has also been spared the routine violence that marks
Russian politics.

But Orban also began his current tenure in an environ-
ment very different from the Russia inherited by Putin.
Hungary had been a successful, if flawed, democracy
for two decades before Orban took office in 2010.

t was a member of the European Union (EU) and
subject to that bloc’s norms and regulations. It was
also a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO). For Hungarians, the events of 1989 led to
democratic liberties and freedom from foreign domi-
nation. For Russia, 1989 and 1991 meant the loss of a
vast empire and the beginning of a decade of political
and economic upheaval.

Given their different contexts, the striking feature in a
Putin-Orban comparison is the similarities. The follow-
ing are some of the more obvious:

¢ Both have repeatedly expressed disdain for
“Western” liberal values.

¢ Both have employed a combination of control
over state broadcasters and crony ownership of
the private press to dominate the mainstream
media, though Hungary's environment remains
notably more free than Russias.

¢ Both have hollowed out the institutions that
provide oversight and transparency regarding
actions by the executive branch.

¢ Both have made clear their dislike for civil
society organizations that pursue reformist or
human rights missions. While Orban has yet to
enact Russian-style laws to declare such groups
“foreign agents’ or ban them as “undesirable,” Fi-

desz has announced the intention to introduce
parliamentary legislation designed to harass
NGOs and curb their funding.'?

¢ Both have seized political opportunities offered
by the presence of ethnic compatriots in sur-
rounding countries. Putin has exploited sup-
posed discrimination against ethnic Russians
and certain other minorities in Ukraine, Georgia,
Moldova, and the Baltic states as justification
for military intervention or hostile propaganda.
Orban has brought nearby Hungarian minorities
into his political coalition by giving them the
right to vote in Hungarian national elections and
making it even easier for them to cast ballots
than it is for Hungarian citizens who are tempo-
rarily working in Europe or elsewhere.

¢ Asa matter of high priority, both Orban and Pu-
tin have secured domination over the judiciary
with the goal of removing its role as a check on
their power.

‘Law and Justice’ in Poland

Like Hungary, Poland was until recently regarded as
one of the chief success stories from the wave of de-
mocratization that accompanied the end of the Cold
War. Poland's democratic institutions were imperfect,
and the economic gains that were made possible by a
rapid changeover to free-market policies were spread
unevenly among the Polish people. But the achieve-
ments seemed to outweigh the deficiencies. The
country's rate of growth was impressive by European
standards; it was one of the few EU member states to
emerge relatively unscathed from the financial crisis
of 2008. Its leaders exercised influence within the EU
and NATO, and enjoyed global respect.

According to the leaders of the archconservative Law
and Justice (PiS) party, however, Poland was a deeply
troubled society whose system of government was in
need of a top-to-bottom overhaul.

Ahead of the 2015 elections, PiS appropriated a vo-
cabulary similar to that of Fidesz in its 2010 campaign.
lt depicted the center-right government as the archi-
tect of a failed economy. It denounced mainstream
leaders as more comfortable with the cosmopolitan
liberal values of Brussels and Berlin than with the
traditional Christian morality of rural Poland. And PiS
suggested that the liberal establishment that had gov-
erned for most of the postcommunist period had “sto-

*   Asset allocation –– Local risks and opportunities trump global forces in driving investment opportunities. Cross-market correlations to remain much lower than in recent years. 

*   Economics –– US activity data are coming in better than hoped, but we need another 1-2 months to see how consumers are responding to higher taxes.    

*   Fixed Income –– Search for carry to trump Euro area jitters over time.

*   Equities –– Japan remains our main country overweight.  

*   Credit –– We OW covered bonds in the Euro periphery over senior bank bonds and subordinated vs senior bank bonds in the core.

*   Currencies –– Cyprus to have minimal further impact on EUR, but a ECB rate cut would push it a few cents lower versus the dollar.

*   Commodities –– Stay long Brent and short gasoline. 

 

*   US stocks continue to gain, with the benchmark S&P500 breaching its all time high level today in a gentle fashion. Bonds are generally up this week on dovish comments from both the Fed and the BoJ. Commodities have gained also, but credit remains the troubled asset class with spreads wider in most markets, especially in EM external debt. 

*   Our overall investment theme remains that there is no overarching global investment theme anymore this year but instead a number of unrelated local forces that have largely local impact. The generalized asset reflation we saw last year, with risk premia coming down consistently across the globe and asset classes, was due to a gradual fading of tail risks that has since been largely completed. “Risk-on, risk- off is so last year”. 

*   In addition, we are seeing no momentum either way in global growth, price or earnings expectations that could put us into a bullish or bearish growth story. Our 2.4% projection for 2013 world economic growth is unchanged since November. YTD activity data for the world are tracking our 2.6% forecast for Q1, comfortably up from the dismal 1.6% in Q4 of last year. Amidst offsetting up- and downside surprises in the US and Japan versus Europe, there has been no reason yet to raise the growth profile for the year as a whole. We hope, but need evidence first.

*   Without a global growth or fading-of-tail-risks force, we are left with a set of local issues and opportunities that are having a local impact, at the regional, asset class and company level, that should leave the rest of the world largely unmoved. In this environment, correlations across regions and risk markets should remain significantly lower than in past years. Various markets may seem to behave “inconsistently” with others, but we caution against expecting simple mean reversion, given our view of the reduced impact of global factors. Active investors should pay more attention to local fundamentals while long-term investors can expect to achieve greater gains from cross-market and international diversification.

 

*   Local issues must be monitored and understood, though, to decide how to allocate capital and risk. Just to review a few, Japanese policy makers continue to present a concerted plan to reflate their economy through monetary, fiscal and structural measures. The strong control of the government and its high approval rating are steadily raising the chance of success. We stay overweight Japanese equities and grow wary of the short yen trade, as capital inflows and rising growth expectations (chart of right) are ultimately bullish for the currency. Watch next week’s BoJ meeting, led by newly appointed Governor Kuroda, for new reflationary measures.  

*   The Euro area economy remains in recession, while policy makers are making little effort to reverse the contraction. We monitor signs of any large deposit flight post Cyprus over coming weeks and months to judge whether the bailout may actually be worsening conditions in the Euro. Economic forecast momentum remains negative (chart of right). These are good reasons to underweight the Euro area, if not all of Europe, across asset classes, against the rest of the world. 

*   The US, in contrast, is seeing better spending from both corporates and consumers than we could have expected post Fiscal Cliff and sequestration. But given the huge amount of fiscal drag, which is a fact, we want to see another 1-2 months of data before extrapolating the good news. It did support US equities in recent weeks, which continue to benefit from US corporates issuing debt to buy their own shares and others', through M&A. This corporate rotation from debt to equities is almost exclusively a US flow, which helps explain US equity outperformance. 

*   Across risk assets, we are similarly seeing huge delinking, with equities rallying greatly and commodities and credit seeing no gains (chart p. 1), very much unlike last year. Commodities are delinking as there are no growth upgrades in EM, and inflation concerns are concentrated on two countries, UK and Japan. Credit is delinking as most investors are massively overweight credit versus equities, as evidenced by the disparity in buying flows in 2011-12. Relevering by US corporate and the Fed debating the end of QE are signaling that the 3-decade long rally in bonds is likely over. Investors are starting to dollar-average away from bonds to equities. 


Fixed Income


*   Bonds rallied again, except for Euro area peripherals, the source of this week’s market concerns. The imposition of capital controls on Cypriot deposits is to be sure a watershed moment, but for now not one we expect to spark significant deposit withdrawals elsewhere. Meanwhile, the most likely outcome to the Italian impasse appears to be new elections in the autumn. With seemingly little prospect of a material rise in yields on the safest assets, we think the search for carry evident across the full gamut of asset markets will see peripheral spreads narrow over time. 

*   Ten-year JGB yields have rallied to within a few bps of their all-time low, ahead of next week’s inaugural meeting for the new BoJ leadership. We do indeed expect aggressive easing, with JGB purchases out to 30 years, but think this will be trumped by profit taking in JGBs after the fiscal year end. 

*   Our latest Inflation Expectations Survey (F. Diamond, K. Gupta) was out yesterday. One interesting result is that almost 90% of respondents believe the BoJ has less than a 50/50 shot of hitting its 2% inflation target in two years, a reflection of the formidable challenge of sparking inflation expectations after two decades of falling prices. 


Equities


*   The global rally in equity markets slowed this week, but did not reverse, on continued concerns about the fallout from a poorly executed Cyprus solution. The Euro area underperformed again, for a second week in a row.  As discussed last week, we view Cyprus as a local problem that we address by underweighting Euro area equities in a global portfolio. A potential negative feedback loop from markets to the economy poses a serious downside risk for Euro area growth over coming months prolonging the current run of negative economic surprises from the region.

*   Japan is the region we like the most. In our mind the Japanese equity trade has further legs not only due to prospective BoJ balance sheet expansion but more importantly due to a reform agenda to be unveiled into the summer.  

*   EM equities are suffering from renewed policy tightening in major EM economies such as Brazil and China. Investors have bitter memories of previous property tightening measures in China. As within DM, we see a lot of divergences within EM and prefer to focus on under-owned markets with good domestic demand story such as Mexico and Malaysia.  See “Consensus Asset Allocation”, Adrian Mowat and team, Mar 26th. Open overweights in Mexican and Malaysia equities vs MSCI EM.

*   For long-term investors we just released our quarterly publication Trade opportunities for long term investors Mar 27. We monetize risk premia in Value stocks via a long in S&P500 Value vs S&P500 ETFs. It appears that a five year long underperformance of Value stocks has come to an end. We take profit on trades that monetize skew risk premia in S&P500 due to sharp contraction over the past quarter. We continue to monetize equity risk premia via buying high dividend yield equity ETFs against USTs. Our preference is to buy ETFs which track the S&P US Preferred stock due to its high yield, around 6%, and its high weight on Financials. 


Credit


*   The news flow from the Cypriot bailout continued to push spreads wider and vol higher this week, with European Financials underperforming as creditor bail-in risks returned to the forefront. iTraxx senior and subordinated financials indices widened 20bp as investors sought to hedge via CDS rather than sell bonds. European credit continued to underperformed US credit.

*   The fact that Cypriot banks debt is only 1.3% of total liabilities was a key factor in the decision to bail-in depositors. Yet events surrounding the banking sector restructuring also suggest that keeping senior unsecured bondholders immune from costly bail-outs is politically untenable. This removes the implicit ‘cover’ that senior bonds holders have enjoyed and has increased speculation that implementation of the bail-in proposals under the EU’s Resolution & Recovery Directive (RRD) will be brought forward to 2015 from the current 2018 time-frame.

*   As such, our colleagues in European Credit have examined the implications of changing recovery rate expectations across the bank capital structure. Assuming that covered bonds remain outside the scope of the proposals, we expect senior bank bond spreads to widen relative to covered bonds and prefer being OW covered bonds vs senior bonds in the periphery, particularly in Spain where covered bonds have first claim over the entire mortgage book of the bank. From a relative value point of view, we also suggest owning subordinated bank bonds vs senior bank bonds in the core as, under the new RRD regime, there is a higher probability than before that senior bank bond holders will lose money and this risk is, in our mind, not yet in the price (Rethinking the capital structure, R. Henriques et al., Mar 27).


Foreign Exchange


*   Today’s research note, Sacrificing Cyprus, examines several presumptions which have arisen over the past two weeks due to the Cyprus crisis, and scores them on a scale of truths, half-truths and falsehoods. There are indeed some right conclusions to draw from this experience, but also some wrong ones. As examples, it is true that capital controls have created a two-tier euro, but very unlikely that Cyprus is exiting EMU. And while it is true that markets deserve a risk premium for policy uncertainty, the size of the premium should be much lower than in previous crises due to backstops like the OMT.

*   For example, during the first Greek crisis in May 2010 EUR undershot by 10% relative to cyclical conditions at that time, and during Greek elections in May 2012 the currency undershot by 5%. The combination of Italian and Cypriot events have eliminated the euro’s overvaluation from early 2013, when the currency spiked to the high $1.30s on a presumption that LTRO funds would be repaid rapidly, driving European rates higher. The currency is now close to fair value, so carries no risk premium for contagion. The message is similar in vol markets: the 1% premium for 3-mo implied versus realized vol is far less than the 5% premium witnessed during previous crises. 

*   While there is no evidence that the EUR/USD cash or options market carries a risk premium, it is also true that the required premium should probably be far less than in previous crises given that a sovereign funding backstop like the OMT is in place. We are thus reluctant to extrapolate this mini-crisis into a systemic event which triggers broad deleveraging, or to forecast trend euro weakness. The currency could trade down a couple of cents around an ECB rate cut, but assuming that fears around Cyprus contagion pass in a month or two, the currency should reverse its recent decline by the summertime. 


Commodities 


*   Commodities rallied this week, up almost 2%, led by energy. We went tactically long Brent in last week’s J.P. Morgan View as we believed that the correction in oil markets had brought prices too far below our price forecast of $112/bbl. Since then Brent is up around 1.5%. We stay long and expect further price appreciation over coming months. We are also short gasoline vs. Brent. Gasoline cracks (the premium for gasoline over crude prices) spiked over the first three months of the year due to a combination of low inventories and refinery closures that came during refinery maintenance season. As refinery maintenance comes to a close and demand falls seasonally, gasoline prices should fall relative to Brent. 

*   We went long Soybean time spreads late last year (GMOS, Dec 5) on a view that much higher Brazilian supplies would find it difficult to leave the country due to logistical constraints. Since then we have seen a record number of ships planning to load soybeans in Brazilian ports and this number is still rising. The average waiting time before loading is also rising, now 38 days compared to 26 days a month ago. This has caused the front Soybean contract to rally while longer maturity contracts have been depressed by the much higher than normal supply inside the country. The spread between the May-13 and Jul-13 contracts has doubled since we put the trade on in December. We stay long as we think these logistical issues are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011693.txt,"My job was to ensure the security not just of the Gush Emunim march but of
the counter-demonstrators, and, of course, the local Palestinian population. As
the rival marches by the Israelis proceeded, I personally delivered warnings
against any violence, both to the settlement leaders and to a pair of the most
prominent counter-protesters, the peace activist Uri Avneri and Knesset member
Yossi Sarid. The event went off without major incident. But the next day,
Davar, the venerable Labor newspaper I’d first read as a child in Mishmar
Hasharon, let rip against me. Under a photo of me with Avneri and Sarid — my
arm raised, ostensibly in some kind of threat but actually in the time-honored
Jewish practice of talking with my hands — the article accused me of siding with
the settlers. If blood was spilled in the weeks and months ahead, the newspaper
said, “it will be on Barak’s hands.”

Ordinarily, I would have ignored it. But never in my military career had I
been similarly attacked on an issue of any importance. I was especially angry
because not only was the insinuation unfounded. It was diametrically opposite to
the stance I was determined to take in this, my first regional command. Yes, I
was committed to providing security for the settlers. But especially in the wake
of the crimes of the Jewish underground, I was determined to ensure they
remained within the boundaries of the law.

A few days later, I called Rabin’s aide and asked to see the Defense
Minister, and was told to come see him after Saturday lunch at his home. When
I arrived, Rabin got right down to business. “Ehud, you wanted to see me?” he
said. “You’ve probably seen Davar,” I replied. “It was a pretty nasty piece. It
distorted things.” Yet as he began asking for details, it seemed he had no idea
what I was talking about. “Ehud, I never read it,” he said. “If you hadn’t told
me, I’d never have known there was an issue.” I assumed this was a white lie,
told to reassure me. But years later, when I was Minister of Defense, and then
Prime Minister, I sometimes found myself on the other side of such meetings.
An officer or official would come see me because of something said about them
in the media, or remarks they were quoted as having made. When I told them
I’d been unaware of it, I could see the disbelief in their eyes. By then, however,
I realized that under the multiple demands of a senior role in government, you
really could fail to notice events that others viewed as crucial to their
reputations or careers. To reassure them I truly hadn’t noticed, I’d tell them the
story of my meeting with Rabin.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018609.txt,"I published this interview in January 2012 at the gender-lens website RoleReboot.org,

One Blurred Edge of Sex Work: Portrait of a Sugar Baby

Sex work is a controversial and polarized topic, and there are many perspectives on it.
My position is complex -- but for me, when it comes to how we actually interact with sex
workers, one important factor is whether or not they consent to and enjoy their jobs. Iam
absolutely in favor of giving better options to sex workers who do not enjoy their jobs,
and I am horrified by the idea of a person being trafficked or coerced into sex that they
don't want to have. But I also know people who have sex for money 100% voluntarily,
and I do not want to deny their experience.

My friend Olivia, a 25-year-old graduate student, recently started advertising her services
ona Sugar Baby” site called SeekingArrangement.com. I think it's important for more
people to understand these kinds of experiences, so I asked to interview her. Many people
have pointed out that once a person starts thinking about the definition of prostitute, it's
a bit difficult to define what exactly a prostitute is. Some of my sex worker friends have
asked the question: what exactly is the difference between a person whose partner buys
her a fancy dinner after which they have sex -- and a person whose partner buys sex with
money? Olivia has thought at length about this, and I'm grateful to her for sharing her
perspective on that question, and others.

Please note that Olivia is exceptionally privileged. What you are about to read is a
portrait of what the sex industry looks like for a person who is very privileged: she comes
from a white upper-middle-class background, she is not desperate, she is being paid a lot
of money, she does not have a drug addiction. Many other peoples’ experiences in the sex
industry are very different.

Clarisse Thorn: Hey Olivia, thanks so much for being willing to talk about this
incredibly complicated topic. Could you start by defining a sugar baby site? What is
it?

Olivia: I use the site SeekingArrangement.com. I don't actually know how many sugar
baby sites there are, but I get the sense there's more than one. It's very hard to pin down
exactly what it does. I guess it connects people, usually with a big age gap, who are
interested in exchanging some kind of material goods or financial resources for some
form of companionship that is often sexual -- but not always.

As far as I can tell, the site's founder is very against the claim that this is prostitution. He
puts out a lot of publicity claiming that this site has nothing to do with prostitution. At
first I thought that he was trying to evade legal consequences, but I think he actually
probably believes that. The site has a blog that he controls, and you can look at it to get a
sense of what he's thinking. One post I think is really interesting is called Sugar Baby &

Sugar Daddy: The Modern Day Princess & Prince?, which compares being a sugar baby
to a kind of happily ever after princess fantasy.

growing antagonism toward the U.S. government, he had not given
up on, if not becoming a secret agent, working in the netherworld of
secret intelligence.

There was still a back door through which he could reenter the
spy world. Private corporations hired civilian technicians to work
for spy agencies as independent contractors. By 2009, the CIA, the
NSA, and other U.S. intelligence services had outsourced much of
the job of maintaining and upgrading their computer systems to
these private companies. They supplied the NSA with most of its
system administrators and other information technology workers.
This arrangement allowed the NSA to effectively bypass budget
limits and other restrictions limiting how many NSA technicians
it could recruit. Instead of being on the NSA’s own payroll, these
people nominally worked for, and received their paychecks from,
private employers. In fact, many of these outside contractors worked
full-time for the NSA.

Snowden applied in April 2009 to one of these private compa-
nies, a subsidiary of the Dell computer company. To diversify out of

© manufacturing computers, Dell had recently gone into the business ©
of managing government computer systems for the NSA and other
intelligence services. As a leading specialist in the field of corporate
cyber security, Dell had no problem obtaining sizable contracts from
the NSA’s Technology Directorate. In 2008, the NSA had in effect
outsourced to Dell the task of reorganizing the backup systems at its
regional bases. Dell had to find thousands of independent contrac-
tors to work at these bases. In 2009, it was seeking to fill positions
at the NSA’s regional base in Japan, and Snowden applied. Relocat-
ing would be no issue for him because he had a longtime interest in
going to Japan.

He had little problem obtaining the job. He had a single compel-
ling qualification: like all other CIA officers, he had been given a
top secret clearance. For an outside contractor such as Dell, such a
security clearance was pure gold. If a potential recruit lacked it, Dell
needed to wait for a time-consuming background check that would
have to be conducted before it could deploy him or her at the NSA.
Ifa recruit already had the clearance, as Snowden did, he could begin
working immediately.

reactor near Baghdad, there was never any question that we would take any and all
possible measures to prevent Syria from getting a nuclear weapon. An immutable,
core assumption in Israel’s security strategy was the need to retain our ability to
deter, and if necessary defeat, our enemies. A nuclear Syria — or Iraq, or Iran —
would dramatically alter the balance of power in the region, at obvious risk to
Israel. Syria posed a particular threat, as part of an increasingly close alliance with
Iran, and with Hizbollah in Lebanon.

The question, however, was how and when to strike the reactor. Olmert wanted
to attack within days. He seemed to assume that, as a former chief of staff, ’'d nod
enthusiastically and go along with him. I did understand the reasons for his sense
of urgency. Not only did we have to make sure we attacked before the fuel was on
site. There was always the risk the Syrians would find out that we were aware of
their nuclear facility, putting them on even higher alert. But the operational
challenge was complex. We need a fail-safe plan to destroy the reactor. We had to
do it in such a way as to avoid a full-scale military confrontation with Syria if
possible. And we had to ensure we were ready for that, if it did happen. It took
very little time for me to realize that none of those prerequisites was yet in place.
Not unlike the recent Lebanon war, we were choosing between two off-the-shelf
plans from the kirya. One involved using a large military force, and would almost
certainly draw us into a major conflict with Syria. The other was a smaller,
targeted operation. But it remained untested, and there was no certainty it would
actually destroy the reactor.

Over the next few months, Olmert got more and more frustrated with the fact
we hadn’t yet attacked, and frustrated with me as well. We held dozens of
meetings, sometimes two or three a day, chaired by the Prime Minister, sometimes
by me as Defense Minister, or by the chief of staff or service commanders.
Invariably, I began my remarks by saying: “We have to destroy the reactor.” This
was not because I felt that any of us seriously doubted that. It was because Olmert
was beginning to suggest to the few ministers and senior officers aware of our
planning that I was against attacking the reactor. In fact, I was working with the
military and Mossad to ensure we had a plan that would succeed, with the
minimum possible risk of drawing us into a major clash with the Syrians after the
facility was destroyed. I was also working — with the help of the Americans — to
make sure we could get the forces and munitions in place in the north of Israel to

My favorite characters in the Bible and in literature are those who challenge authority: Adam and
Eve defying God and eating the forbidden fruit of knowledge; Abraham chastising God for
threatening to sweep away the innocent along with the guilty; Moses imploring God to change his
mind about destroying the “stiff-necked” Jewish people.

My favorite Justices of the Supreme Court are the dissenters. My favorite historical figures are
political and religious dissidents. My closest friends are iconoclasts. Some of my best teachers
were fired.

The First Amendment would have been nothing more than a parchment promise had it not been
given life by brave political dissidents and bold judicial dissenters. Because of these provocateurs,
the First Amendment has not become ossified with age. It has changed with the times, sometimes
for the better, sometimes for the worse. Although the literal words have remained the same for
more than two centuries, two of the most important ones have been changed beyond recognition.
These words are “Congress” and “no.” (“Congress shall make no law....”) The controversial
role of these two words can best be illustrated by a story; perhaps aprocrophyl but reflecting
reality, about two great and contentious justices, Hugo Black, who claimed to be an absolutist
and literalist when it came to the words of the First Amendment, and Felix Frankfurter, who
advocated a more functional balancing approach despite the seemingly clear words of that
Amendment. In a case involving censorship by a state, Black pulled out his ragged old copy of
the Constitution, turned to the First Amendment and read it out loud to the lawyer representing
the state. “Read the words,” he shouted at the intimidated lawyer. “It says Congress shall make
NO law abridging the freedom of speech.” He banged the table as he shouted and repeated the
word “no.” “What don’t you understand about the word ‘no,’” he asked rhetorically. Justice
Frankfurter interrupted and said, “You’re reading the words wrong.” The lawyer looked startled
as the Justice explained. “It doesn’t say ‘Congress shall make NO law.’ It says, “CONGRESS
shall make no law,’” banging the table as he shouted and repeated the word “Congress.” He then
continued, “This law wasn’t passed by Congress, it was passed by the state. What don’t you
understand about the word ‘Congress,’” he asked, mocking his fellow justice.

By emphasizing different words, the two justices were giving radically different meanings to the
very same language of the First Amendment.

The reality is that both of these words—“Congress” and “no”—have been excised over time. The
first—“Congress”—was central to the history of the Bill of Rights, which was seen by its framers
largely as a bill of restrictions on the power of the national legislature—namely “Congress.”
There was considerable concern that the Constitution, which replaced the Articles of
Confederacy, bestowed too much power on the national legislature, thus reducing the rights
(really the powers) of the states to legislate for their citizens.*° The First Amendment was not
intended by its framers to impose restrictions on the states. In fact when the Bill of Rights was
enacted, and for many years thereafter, many states had laws severely abridging the freedom of
speech and of the press. (Several states also had officially established churches and officially
discriminated against Catholics, Jews, Turks and “other” Pathens.) Ifthe framers had wanted to
impose restriction on the states, it would have been simple to have written a more general

°6 The rarely invoked 10 Amendment makes this clear: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

"
IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018240.txt,"I had only been living in China then for about four or five years, so I was still a bit
surprised to learn in this unusual way about what I would later come to know - and
see and even experience myself - as the spiritual life of China’s communist officials,
particularly those at the absolute top of the system. The Master my friend was
referring to was Master Nan. Though he was largely unknown outside of China - I
am sure you had not heard of him until a few pages ago - in China he was an icon.
After his return to the mainland in the 1990s, his books about Buddhism and
philosophy sold millions of copies. His lectures are watched on DVDs and the
Internet, and he owns a fond fame that reaches across generations and transcends
politics or art or philosophy. You are as likely to find a copy of his book on the desk
of a university President as stuffed into the back pocket of a tea-server in Chengdu.

As you can imagine, when my friend first introduced me to the idea of someone like
Master Nan serving as a spiritual mentor to the figures struggling to master this
huge country, figures I had met and worked with in the brutally rational business of
everyday life in a modernizing China, it raised all sorts of questions. We both have
the same master? But in China, one thing you discover pretty quickly is that honest
understanding of anything isn’t achieved by asking lots of questions, particularly not
the direct sort. Yun Men had it right: Ten thousand kinds of clever talk get you
nowhere meaningful. But with her one sentence, the dinner conversation, which had
been moving pleasantly enough through the eddies of China’s politics and
economics, passed into deeper water, where it has stayed in the years since.

Master Nan’s particular passion, | learned that night, was a branch of Chinese Ch’an
Buddhism that had, about 1000 years ago, provided the seeds for the Japanese
school of “instant illumination,” known as Rinzai Zen. Rinzai is famed in the west for
asking students to grapple with koans, the sorts of puzzles - “What was your face
before your were born?” or “What is the sound of one hand clapping?” or just “Mu!”
- that can never be approached or answered by reason alone. They require nothing
but pure, trained instinct. Koans are not like math problems or word puzzles, so
much as questions that have to be answered with your whole soul. We don’t really
have an educational concept like this in the west, but the aim of Rinzai meditation
and learning is to arrive at kensho (jianxing in Chinese), a sudden and complete
understanding of the true nature of the world. Such “instant illumination” marks a
very eastern sensibility: Real truth resists the grasp of mere logic. It can’t be simply
explained, or taught with words alone. It calls on more immediate feelings, in the
way we night fall in love or get angry. In Rinzai study, the aim is to tighten and
compress your mind with meditation and focus and exercise - and the occasional
slapping sharpness of a hardwood “enlightenment stick” - as a way to open it, with
the goal of instant, blazing enlightenment. In such a moment, all sorts of invisible
relations become unforgettably obvious.

I] had been a student of Rinzai since | was 16. So it was that, in the springtime of the

year after that dinner in Beijing, I was surprisingly, luckily invited to Master Nan’s
campus.

JS: Just for the record, neither Brad, nor I, nor anyone representing that they have anything to
do with us has made any promises to you. Is that correct?

V: That is correct. I’ll tell you, since this is our first conversation, that nobody has made me
feel like I’ve been bribed or bought or had to say anything. I’ve told you anything that I
know from my own self, not some things somebody told me. If anything, Brad’s been
extra careful not to tell me anything and let me do all the talking, so it’s quite opposite I
think.

JS: Alright. Let’s get back then to the story of your relationship with Jeffrey, and we’ve
talked about your first encounter with him and how it evolved from that into your full
time employment with Jeffrey, but what were you doing at Mar-a-Lago before you quit
Mar-a-Lago?

V: I was just a locker room attendant and sometimes I did babysitting for the rich and
famous. So, I wasn’t anything big. I worked in the spa area. That’s why I was studying
anatomy, because I was really really interested in becoming a_massage therapist_, and at
the locker room, I didn’t do much. I mean I was making tea for a living, I would, you
know, make sure the toilet paper had a little triangle in it after everybody went to the
toilet, or wipe down the water from the basin, you know, it was a very easy peasy job.

JS: Did you get that job through your Dad?
V: Yes, my Dad got me the job.

JS: Ok, and you were only 15 years old at the time, were they aware of how old you were at
Mar-a-Lago?

V: Of course, definitely. We had to go through extensive, you know, we even had to get
drug tested and id test and so on and so forth. I mean, Mantas (?) is very strict on
employment, yeah, everybody knew.

JS: | Ok. Was there ever any conversation with Ghislaine about how old you were before you
were taken to Jeffrey’s mansion?

V: No. She didn’t ask me how old I was from the start, but when I did get to Jeffrey’s
mansion, it was discussed how old I was.

JS: With whom?

V: During the entire hour of what I call the legitimate massage I was giving him, it was cat

whole existence is surrounded by non-deterministic physics. Therefore,
your actions are not predetermined by anything in your local corner of
the Universe — the past light cone if you want to be strict about the physics.

The determined determinists are a determined bunch. Just because
the information that determines your actions cannot be encoded by the
particles you are made from, does not mean youare free. The information
could be stored in parts of the Universe we cannot see, or held outside
the Universe in some sort of cosmic hard drive. Every creative event in
the Universe would be specified in this store.

But this begs the third question: How was this store of information
generated in the first place? If a Universe contains creative things — as our
Universe does — there is no way to computably generate the necessary
determinist store of information. The Universe has free will because there
is no deterministic process that could generate it.

If our Universe were a Turing machine, everything within it
would be too. Think about the deterministic clockwork argument I
gave earlier. If you try to construct a better — say a more random -—
machine inside a Turing machine, an observer could simply ignore the
better machine hidden within it, and watch the outer machine work.
The outer machine will predict the operation of the inner machine
perfectly, even if the inner machine is fiendishly complicated. We
have to consider the machine on which our human software runs. Our
bodies, our minds, all that we are, is software running on the Universe's
hardware of quarks and photons. If the hardware is deterministic, then
so is our software. And if the hardware is deterministic, there can be no
creativity within the Universe.

So the free will camp has an argument easily as frustrating as the
one deployed by the determinists. Every time a determinist asks, “How
do you know you were not always going to do that?” the free will believer
can reply, “You asked me a question. If this dialogue is to have any
significance, then we must exist in a rational Universe and, therefore, the
laws of information give us creativity and free will. If you believe we are
fully determined, there is no point in my answering your question.”

I reason. Therefore, I have free will.

The Universe is not a machine.

Some S&M encounters have a rhythm to them, a poetry: a beginning and an end that
become clear to the participants as they go along. This one didn't -- at least not to me. So
I didn't rely on him to bring it to a close. After a while, I safeworded out, and took a
breath to still my tears.

Mr. Ambition was quiet again. I was having trouble reading him. There was some energy
caught inside him, coiled like a dragon, but I couldn't tell if it was violence or something
else. I put a halt to my own emotional cycle and tried to focus on him. How are you
feeling? I asked, but he couldn't tell me. I asked a few more questions, and he just
couldn't answer. He just didn't know.

I never got another word from him on how he felt about that encounter. I wondered if I
was being too careful in how I asked about it; I wondered if he wanted me to push harder;
I wondered if I'd already pushed him too far.

I suspected there were some dramatic feelings trapped in Mr. Ambition. But I wasn't sure
I currently had the warmth to coax them out.

te Ok ok

In the past, I've fallen in love so hard that I felt like the world was black-and-white when
I was away from my lover; I felt like I only saw color when I was with him. I have dated
men where the chemistry was so intense, so obvious, that it hung in the air between us
like smoke. I've had sex that felt like telepathy. It's pretty awesome when it works. And
it's easier to get that with some people than with others: some guys, I meet them and it's
like we speak the same language already.

With some guys, it's not instant, but it also doesn't take long to build our mutual
vocabulary.

And then I've dated guys where the learning curve -- both sexually and temperamentally
-- was much longer. It was less instinctive. But it was not impossible. So I know for a fact
that people can build chemistry. Sometimes it's just there, but sometimes you can create
it.

My relationship with Mr. Ambition was definitely polyamorous, but a few weeks in, I
decided I was really into him... and I started managing my incentives. There was another
guy I saw occasionally, with whom I had stronger instinctive chemistry. This other guy
agreed with me that we didn't want a Big Important Relationship. This other guy will
screw up my incentives if I hang out with him too much, I thought, and I limited my time
with him. I set rules with myself: I didn't call him, I didn't text him. I knew: /fJ let myself
get too intensely into this other guy, that could inhibit my ability to bond with Mr.
Ambition.

I told the other guy that once my relationship with Mr. Ambition was more stable, we
might be able to pursue something more intense. By the time we had the conversation, he
said he'd already been thinking similar thoughts. That he didn't want to distract me from
something that could be beautiful.

contexts, dS is expressed in units of heat called Joules per degree of absolute
temperature in units Kelvin, the temperature in Centigrade plus 273.16°. The best-
known physical image involves the heat-energy transfer to and from heat baths
called reservoirs as intermediate actions of the work of the heat driven engine
executing what has come to be known as the Carnot Cycle. The same formulation
emerges in this more concrete context: the heat, Q, transfer, dQ, at a particular
absolute temperature, T, dQ/T, has been used to define an entropy change, dS =
dQ/T related to some not-need-to-know-about specific alteration(s) in a system’s
internal physical properties.

lf one allows some loose thinking about heat-induced increases in the
Statistical randomness of molecular motion in the above reservoir that is associated
with the loss of useable energy, the positive entropy change, dS > 0, is vaguely
relatable to the kinds of information entropies to be discussed below. If a gas
trapped in an insulated, physically isolated, closed cylinder is allowed to expand
infinitely slowly, reversibly, called adiabatically, pushing up the piston that closed off
its end, the gas will become cooler, energy having been expended doing the work of
lifting the piston. Defined as an isolated system (of course no where in the real, non-
laboratory, world can this condition of absent exchanges of energy or matter with
the environment be found), it is a reversible process, because returning the energy
of the work by, again, infinitely slowly pushing down on the piston and compressing
the gas to its original volume, returns it to its former temperature-defined energy
state. In this historically prominent thought-toy of physics, there has been a
reversible change in energy but no changes in the entropy, dS = 0. The gas’s heat,
temperature (and energy and volume) can be completely restored in this
metaphysically mythic classical thermodynmical tale of an entropy-conserving,

reversible process.

While fixed entropy and independence of the specific path is the case for the
above noted abstract reversible cycle, in the real, irreversible orbits of most physical
and all biological systems, entropy increases, dS > 0. Walter Nernst’s 1907 heat

theorem yields a zero point from which to determine a difference measure in the

Hamas based its launchers in precisely those places. So it was not easy. At one
point, we announced a call-up of reserves. We hinted at a possible ground
incursion. But both Bibi and I knew we were going to avoid that if at all possible,
and we did. Though there were inevitable civilian casualties, most of the
Palestinians killed were Hamas fighters and leaders, including not just Jabari but
the head of Hamas’s rocket program. By limiting ourselves to air strikes and naval
fire, the Palestinian death toll was around 150, about one-tenth of what it had been
in 2008. Six Israelis, including four civilians, lost their lives. On the 21* of
November, the cease-fire was announced.

Yet with the election approaching, and my time in public life drawing to a
close, I had no illusion that this latest military operation, or future ones, would
bring us closer to the negotiating peace with the Palestinians that had eluded us
since Oslo. Nor was I confident that, having been unable to mount a military strike
of our own on Iran, Obama’s “bigger, stronger kid” in the schoolyard would take
military action. I did trust him to do all he could to use diplomacy to constrain
Iran’s efforts to get a bomb. I feared he might fail. Even if he succeeded, I figured
the best case would be an agreement that, at least on paper, delayed the Iranians’
development of a weapon. My hope remained that Israel’s relationship with the
Americans would be sufficiently strong for us to reach a formal understanding of
what form of surgical military strike each of our countries might take if Iran didn’t
honor the terms of a negotiated deal.

When I first left political life after my election defeat in 2001, I'd described my
status as the equivalent of a reserve officer. I said, and believed, it was unlikely P’'d
return for the foreseeable future. But I knew it wasn’t impossible. This time was
different. When I announced publicly that I was leaving politics, five days after the
Gaza cease-fire, I pointed that I had spent the greater part of my life as a soldier.
I’d never had a burning desire to be a politician. Though I believed that what I'd
attempted, and achieved, in government would prove to have safeguarded and
strengthened Israel, I knew that important challenges and decisions still lay ahead.
So did our unfulfilled dream of being a country that was not just strong, secure and
prosperous, but socially just and at peace. Yet I believed it was right to draw my
time on the front line of politics to an end. Though I didn’t say so, I thought to
myself: this time doesn’t feel like a step back into the reserves, but genuinely like
the end of something. Though my dedication to a secure, strong, just, democratic
and ultimately peaceful Israel would not change, whatever contribution I might

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018268.txt,"our age, small-sized problems were spilling rapidly into crises of strategy. One hot
battlefield instant - an explosion under an armorless truck, say - could freeze the
operations of a billion-dollar division. Nearly everyone begins to ask, sometimes out
loud: Why did that happen? Followed pretty quickly by: What the hell are we doing
here? The little bombs were shaking more than the Humvees.

Walking into the Pentagon, one is struck by cascading sensations of immensity and
volume and, frankly, gravity. Surely, you reflect, there must be someone here with a
plan for everything? But there was not; there is not now. Yet the massiveness, the
ineffable historical density and weight of American power, is so breathtaking that its
frequent impotence in the face of a changing world represents a particular and
unforgettable and, well, searing shock. The soldiers who had experienced those cold,
failing nights at the edge of superpower rippled with unease. This was the slim
comfort of life inside big, old and lamed structures confronting the fast, blithe and
unstoppable future.

By 2009, with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq settling into a low boil, America’s
generals again began wondering what other cracks were spreading around the
world. The Unknown and the Future seemed to have an uneasy parallel meaning.
The diplomats worried about this too, of course, but with soldiers dying every day,
the questions had a particular urgency for the military. The top of the command
chain asked incessantly about what they might be missing. What fissures were
running even through their own building, masked by its scale but waiting quietly to
make their best plans look foolish and dangerous? And: How they could possibly
confront this world with 30% less of what they had a decade ago? They made a few
phone calls. | received one of them.

It was hard not to notice, if you picked up one of those incoming queries from
Washington and were asked to draft your views on how this uncertain world might
be approached, that one of the main aims of the American military in recent years -
reducing the number of terrorists - appeared to be backfiring. This was an irritating
feature of many global problems. In spreading market capitalism ever wider, the
world was also digging an ever wider moat between rich and poor, for instance. In
trying to make the world modern with more connection we were, we found, lashing
ourselves to some very unmodern risks. And in waging the most expensive war on
terrorism in human history, the US was uneasily discovering that it was creating
more terrorists. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had sketched the nature of
this puzzle in an October, 2003 memo with acid clarity. He asked: “Are we capturing,
killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas
and the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?”3”? Though

will prevail precisely in situations where there is large but infrequent temptation to defect
and defection is harmful, such as selling a child, betraying a country, or sleeping with
someone for a million dollars. It remains to be shown that taboo trade-offs demonstrate
this characteristic. It also provides an important policy prescription regarding policies
forbidding taboo trade-offs, for example, the ban on euthanasia: such policies are socially
suboptimal, since the benefits of cooperating without looking accrue to the individuals
who advocate them, but the costs are borne by society.

Finally, our model offers an explanation for emotions such as love, and can thus be
thought of as a formalization of Frank (1988). Love has the property that we behave
altruistically towards our partners regardless of what temptations arise [30], as illustrated
by the wedding vow, “for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in
health.” For example, love causes individuals to ignore other potential mates, even if those
mates are better than one’s current mate, as Shakespeare’s Juliet did when her love for
Romeo led her to rebuff the advances of the otherwise-more-suitable Paris.

Why does love have this property? Our model suggests that those in love will more
often be chosen as long-term partners. If this argument in fact underlies love, then it
is crucial that love is observable, and that it necessarily cannot be displayed while still
attending to costs. There is evidence consistent with this: related emotions are observable
[31], cannot be faked [32], and are relied upon by partners when choosing whether to
cooperate [33]. There is also reason to believe love and related emotions would be hard
to fake, given their autonomic origins, and the costs of placing their activation under
conscious control [30, 28]. However, it remains to be shown that love in particular has
these attributes, and that it cannot be displayed while attending to costs.

Our formalism adds novel insights to Frank’s argument about love. First, our model

Did a Palm Beach billionaire being investigated for having sex with young girls use his wealth to negotiate a lenient and secret agreement that saw him
avoid federal prosecution?

Attorneys for two victims, known only as Jane Doe 1 and 2, may soon get an answer thanks to an appeals court ruling against financier and sex offender
Jeffrey Epstein, 61.

The ruling, issued Friday, orders federal authorities to disclose the correspondence that took place between Epstein's attorneys and federal prosecutors when
they were negotiating a 2007 agreement, which allowed him to escape federal prosecution if he pleaded guilty to state charges that carried a lesser penalty.

We're trying to figure out if Epstein used his political connections and great wealth to secure this kind of arrangement. that was unheard of, frankly. if you
look at these charges, said Paul Cassell, an attorney for the women.

Epstein is a native New Yorker who according to media reports built a huge fortune as a money manager and owns several properties including a primary
residence in Manhattan, a Palm Beach mansion and his own island in the Caribbean. At one point he counted among his friends former President Bill
Clinton, Donald Trump and other high-powered figures.

The appeal court decision described the background of Epstein's case, stating that in 2006, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating
allegations that Jeffrey Epstem had sexually abused several minor girls.

In September 2007, federal prosecutors struck the non-prosecution deal with Epstein, but didn't tell the victims, court filings say.

Photos: Crimes that shocked South Florida

Not only did the United States neglect to confer with the victims before it entered into the agreement with Epstein, it also failed to notify them of its
existence for at least nine months, Circuit Judge William H. Pryor wrote in the appeals court decision.

Tn June 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.
He spent 13 months behind bars, and is registered as a sex offender in Florida.

The situation also resulted im civil suits being filed against Epstein, who according to media reports settled claims from about two dozen young women who
alleged he paid them for sexual massages at his Palm Beach mansion, some as young as 14, according to media reports.

To the attorneys who represent the Jane Does 1 and ?, the sentence was much lighter than the years, or possibly decades, that Epstein could've spent behind
bars had he been prosecuted in the federal system.

They're hoping that the correspondence, ordered released by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, will shed light on what they say is an unusually lenient
deal.

T can say that I've been teaching criminal law for more than two decades and I have never seen a plea agreement as lenient as this one, for hands-on sex

offenders,” said Cassell, who is based in Salt Lake City.

But one of Epstein's attorney's. Martin Weinberg, based in Boston, disputed those characterizations. Weinberg said Monday that the plea agreement was
reached in good faith and that it's not a fair conclusion” to describe the agreement as either improper or tainted by Epstein's wealth.

T's Mr. Cassell's hope that this correspondence may support that theory, but the reality is that the U_S. Attorney's Office made a responsible judgment in
how to implement the law,” Weinberg said.

Weinberg said he was concerned about the potential impact the ruling would have on the ability of criminal defense attorneys and prosecutors to
communicate confidentially.

He also said he and Epstein co-counsel, Miami criminal defense attorney Roy Black, will ask the Atlanta-based appeals court to review the decision.

As for the Jane Does, who are now over 18, it's just the latest development in a long legal saga, another one of their attorneys said.

prosecutions as fulfilling the same structural purpose. Allowing private actors to begin prosecutions meets the need for a
system of checks and balances on the office of the district attorney and constitutes a recognition by the legislature that the
office of the district attorney should be subject to a system of checks and balances. °!

The rarity of private charges in jurisdictions that authorize them hardly justifies their abolition. Private prosecutions should be
rare in well-functioning public prosecution systems, because public agencies pursue most provable cases and because private
actors must bear considerable costs to press charges themselves. Moreover, other rules and institutions - including other
safeguards on prosecutorial charging - endure despite few indications of their utility. There has never been a successful claim
that a criminal charge violated the Equal Protection prohibition on racially biased charging, °” but few argue the doctrine lacks
at least normative value. °° Grand juries rarely reject prosecutors’ [*872] charging requests for indictments, but courts
continue to tout them as a structural check on prosecutors. °+ Like private prosecution, these safeguards may work by deterring
biased or ill-conceived prosecutorial decisions; their efficacy 1s probably impossible to measure.

A contributing explanation for the U.S. aversion to private prosecution may lie m a familiar theme of U.S. law and history:
race. During the first several decades of the nineteenth century, when private citizens could prosecute crimes, many states - and

not only Southern ones - either denied African Americans legal capacity as litigants °°

or barred them from testifying under
oath on the basis of race. Among other effects, those barriers barred private prosecutions by African Americans. °° After 1865
- an era in which rights to litigate and testify were viewed by many as more meaningful than the right to vote ?’ - those race-
based legal disabilities were abolished. °° In the same period, private charging authority, already on the decline, was abolished
in most [*873] states that still permitted it. States that retained a formal litigation role for crime victims did so by allowing
privately funded attorneys to assist in prosecutions filed and controlled by public prosecutors, thus ensuring that public officials
are the exclusive gatekeepers of criminal law enforcement. Between the 1840s and 1860s, prosecutors had become locally
elected officials in nearly all states. That effectively aligned their charging monopoly with the preferences of local white
majorities (or white minorities in localities in which black citizens were the majority, once Southern whites succeeded in

disenfranchising black citizens). °? Evidence for the relationship between race and the demise of private prosecution is

6) Among myriad examples are crimes of preparation, conspiracy, possession of contraband, consensual exchanges (e.g., of drugs or sex for
money), and many kinds of criminal attempts. See Andrew Ashworth & Lucia Zedner, Preventive Justice 95-118, 171-223 (2014).

16.5 Beyond Preschool

Once an AGI passes preschool, what are the next steps? There is still a long way to go, from
preschool to an AGI system that is capable of, say, passing the Turing Test or serving as an
effective artificial scientist.

Our suggestion is to extend the school metaphor further, and make use of existing curricula
for higher levels of virtual education: grade school, secondary school, and all levels of post-
secondary education. If an AGI can pass online primary and secondary schools such as e-
tutor.com, and go on to earn an online degree from an accredited university, then clearly said
AGI has successfully achieved “human level, roughly humanlike AGI.” This sort of testing is
interesting not only because it allows assessment of stages intermediate between preschool and
adult, but also because it tests humanlike intelligence without requiring precise imitation of
human behavior.

If an AI can get a BA degree at an accredited university, via online coursework (assuming
for simplicity courses where no voice interaction is needed), then we should consider that AT to
have human-level intelligence. University coursework spans multiple disciplines, and the details
of the homework assignments and exams are not known in advance, so like a human student
the AGI team can’t cheat.

In addition to the core coursework, a schooling approach also tests basic social interaction
and natural language communication, ability to do online research, and general problem solving
ability. However, there is no rigid requirement to be strictly humanlike in order to pass university
classes.

Most of our concrete examples in the following chapters will pertain to the preschool context,
because it’s simple to understand, and because we feel that getting to the “AGI preschool
student” level is going to be the largest leap. Once that level is obtained, moving further
will likely be difficult also, but we suspect it will be more a matter of steady incremental
improvements — whereas the achievement of preschool-level functionality will be a large leap
from the current situation.

16.6 Issues with Virtual Preschool Engineering

As noted above there are two broad approaches to realizing the “AGI Preschool” idea: using
the AGI to control a physical robot and then crafting a preschool environment suitable to the
robot’s sensors and actuators; or, using the AGI to control a virtual agent in an appropriately
rich virtual-world preschool. The robotic approach is harder from an AI perspective (as one must
deal with problems of sensation and actuation), but easier from an environment-construction
perspective. In the virtual world case, one quickly runs up against the current limitations
of virtual world technologies, which have been designed mainly for entertainment or social-
networking purposes, not with the requirements of AGI systems in mind.

In Chapter 9 we discussed the general requirements that an environment should possess to be
supportive of humanlike intelligence. Referring back to that list, it’s clear that current virtual
worlds are fairly strong on multimodal communication, and fairly weak on naive physics. More
concretely, if one wants a virtual world so that

Thanks,

Omar Quadhafi is hunkering down in Tripoli giving press interviews denying that rebels are taking over 
Eastern Libya. Oil prices are shooting over one hundred dollars a barrel. The US government is on the 
verge of a shut down. These are not the top secret opening lines to Aaron Sorkin's new script, but the 
global headlines of a world spinning out of control. I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to 
attend the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat. 
For the second year nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle is down to two. 
The beloved timeless classic, The King's Speech marches into the arena as the front runner, but 
passionate supporters of the brilliant edgier (and critics darling) The Social Network have not 
conceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Filmmakers 
are exhausted from campaigning. 
At Bryan Lourd's famous star studded party Sony Classics' Co-President Michael Barker announces to me he 
has taken a random sampling of voters in the room. He says, There will be a 'Social Network' upset at 
the Kodak Theater. Shear panic radiates from my every pore as he says, I am joking. It's like color 
war at summer camp. 
Woody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists 
against each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. 
My event and publicity company is considered Switzerland by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to 
present and position his work. This year I am somewhat emotionally sucked in. 
In 2005 I meet the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO,Elizabeth 
I. The Emmy award winning movie stars Helen Mirren, who takes credit for discovering him directing 
English television. Helen later wins her Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen 
Elizabeth is the daughter of King George VI portrayed by Oscar winner Colin Firth in The King's Speech. 
I also become Hooper's champion encouraging many to see his early work including his herculean 10 hour 
HBO mini-series John Adams produced by Tom Hanks. 
Six years later at the Telluride Film Festival Tom Hooper is bathing in the glory of a hysterical 
standing ovation with Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first screening of The King's Speech. 
Surprisingly, this drama's subtle humor gets big laughs leading up to its emotional ending. 
Within two weeks, at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein is now standing with his filmmakers 
witnessing the same reaction. The film wins The Audience Prize. Their strategy is to say nothing. Do 
nothing. They have a possible Oscar winner. Four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in 
Toronto. 
Cut to New York City at the end of September. It's the opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln 
Center. One of America's most important and prolific producers Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, 
Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical 
audience who have just seen The Social Network. 
The film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making The Girl 
with the Dragon Tattoo. Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for an Oscar. 
The Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, 
where cool Yale/NYU student James Franco appears and receives a heroic standing ovation. More Oscar buzz. 
Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and even Harvey Weinstein 
slip in the back. Darren Aronofsky, sporting the ever present cool wool scarf around his neck is hailed a 
genius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029773 
Both films are sensational and movie goers go nuts, but it is The King's Speech that edges out the 
competition for The Audience Prize. 
Mid-November David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg, working together for the third time, sneak The Fighter 
in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, Clint Eastwood is 
going to kill himself for not directing this. Wahlberg says, You are wrong. He turned it down because 
he's done it. He has seen it and he loves it. I instantly lavish my affection and praise on David O. 
Russell, who becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting 
actors to beat. 
True Grit directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin doesn't premiere till mid-
December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box 
office gold. 
This is the year many of the 78 million Baby Boomers go back to the theaters. Five small budget 
independent films become surprise hits as each exceeds $100 million 
The Social Network now cements its battle cry with one word; relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the 
cover of Time Magazine as The Person of the Year. A smart and extensive ad campaign positions the film in 
the lead. Critics and pundits proclaim the race is over. The Social Network is the clear winner. 
Everyone goes on holiday. 
This is probably the only time in Harvey Weinstein's life that he is caught off guard. He quickly 
mobilizes an inner team of 15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including Christmas. They 
become like a Chinese Restaurant...always open. A generational war is in full swing. Harvey screens his 
film for the older voters. Everything is done by the books. Budgets are limited. He sends screenwriter 
David Seidler and Tom H000per to every corner of the country doing q+a's till they are blue in the face 
from finding their voice. SAG voters begin seeing the film 2 and 3 times. 
In January the Golden Globes voted on by about 88 foreign journalists gives Best Drama to The Social 
Network, Best Director to David Fincher and Best Screenplay to Aaron Sorkin. Their film is still 
perceived as the Oscar winner. 
Team Weinstein underestimates their hard work and is in shock when The King's Speech wins the PGA in 
L.A. Harvey doesn't even attend and is working in Sundance. They are equally surprised when Tom Hooper 
wins the DGA and the actors win the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced the lead. They are now the front 
runner. It takes the media a few weeks to catch on. 
The Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of The 
King's Speech and is moved by the film. With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, the 
Weinstein Company sends out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. They also 
acknowledge Prime Minister David Cameron's private Christmas screening. 
On Oscar night, it isn't until Hilary Swank surprisingly yells out Hooper's name for Best Director that 
Harvey's gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture. The King has spoken.

Diller and his designer wife Diane Von Furstenberg host their annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their 
Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Governor Jerry Brown, just elected to his 
third (nonconsecutive) term as California Governor. Diane's children, Alex and Tatiana, along with their 
children comprise three generations of guests, which makes this party so special. 
Like last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic 
tables covered with yellow flowers sit on oriental rugs, covering the soggy ground. Terrines of hot soup, 
platters of sausages, fried chicken and salads are beautifully arranged on an endless buffet. Everyone 
wears winter clothes; comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive in a fur coat. 
Barry and Diane's loyal friends have been coming to this party for over fifteen years. Everybody knows 
everybody and it doesn't matter if you have a hit film or TV show this season. Oprah Winfrey kisses David 
Geffen, casually chats with former Disney CEO Michael Eisner and current Sony chief Sir Howard Stringer. 
Brett Ratner arrives with his house guest Jean Pigozzi who is allowed to photograph everyone. Graydon 
greets people with wife Anna and Fran Lebowitz by his side. 
Ingrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch, Ron Meyer, Bryan Lourd Francesco Clemente with his twin 
boys and Tom Ford chat each other up. People watching include the pregnant Victoria and David Beckham 
with Lynn Wyatt, Liv Tyler, Vincent Gallo, Eva Longoria, Larry Gagosian and Shala Monroque, Ben 
Silverman, Debbie and Allen Grubman, Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer 
wearing her oversized cat glasses. 
Bruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast rehearsal. This is a special honor. There are metal 
barricades leading up to the credentials trailer. High-tech security includes photos and computer 
background checks. The only thing they don't do is pat me down and ask for fingerprints. Once inside the 
Kodak Theater's massive auditorium, I find a seat next to Bruce's proud parents. I watch Josh Brolin and 
Javier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best 
Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Screenplay. Josh later told me at The Night Before Party that their 
acting methods are completely opposite. Josh says he is a quick study and is very creative and 
comfortable ad-libbing. Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, needs to have every syllable printed out, 
which he studies with a dialect coach. Little wiggle room for jokes. Life size photos on large cardboard 
plaques are taped to each nominee's chair. I try to memorize their location, so when I return Sunday I 
can quickly kiss them all. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029775 
Back at the Beverly Hills hotel, I slip into my gorgeous black tulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a 
plunging neck line and put on my mother's jewels. Jim Coleman takes me the Night Before Party in the 
hotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg's, 9th Annual A-lister event benefiting The Motion Picture & Television 
Fund where they raise $6.5 million dollars in one night. I walk right into Valentino who gives me the 
once over and approves my outfit. I tell him and Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen's new film, 
Midnight in Paris is opening the Cannes Film Festival and they must bring the yacht. Woody is also 
filming all summer in Rome and I am counting on them to entertain him. 
Elton John and David Furnish join our conversation and of course we ask for intimate details about the 
new baby. Elton says this is the first time they have been away from him for more than a night and they 
are delirious with parenthood. I segway over to Amy Adams who mentions she also hates leaving her baby in 
the hotel room. I tell her she's acted like a lady with all the attention showered on Melissa Leo and 
that someday soon she will win an Oscar because she consistently hands in amazing performances and 
everybody loves her. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg's 
god-daughter Gwyneth Paltrow. Kate gushes as she talks about her two grandchildren from daughter Jessica. 
I have known Steven since I Wanna Hold Your Hand. In 1982, as a young publicist on E.T. I moved to 
California to work for him as one of his thirteen assistants. I now tell him I'm going to Broadway 
opening of War Horse with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to see his movie version. He 
is wildly excited about the film. I beg him to work on it. 
I meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new hair cut and her perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret 
is a half hour on the treadmill every day. Somehow I think that's an understatement. I tell Jesse 
Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week. He was hiding under his hoodie and I knew 
not to bother him. He said innocently, You should have said 'Hello'. I always cover my head because I 
think my curls make me look like a girl. 
The charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at various booths for cheap clothing, new iPads, make-
up, chocolates, shampoo and a $50 dollar Arch gift card for free McDonalds hamburgers. A bargain is a 
bargain, rich people run around like lunatics, collecting gifts for their housekeepers. Among the 
shoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom's Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine 
Taylor and Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchette, Susan and Robert Downey,Jr., and Debra and Hugh Jackman. 
Next stop is The Weinstein Company's Pre-Oscar party at the Soho House, sponsored by MontBlanc, 
celebrating their new charity partnership and $1 million dollar donation to the Princess Grace 
Foundation-USA. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night parties where nominees spoofed their own 
films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. Grown men would dress as Anna Paquin and play 
the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award. 
There is social anxiety at the Soho House garage entrance. Guests patiently wait as super stars whisk by. 
A four hundred pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator until I spot Benny Medina. Once on, I see 
the radiant Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik's yacht in Cannes. She 
graciously pretends to know me. Her manager, Benny Medina is kicking me. 
I slip into Colin Firth's booth by the front bar to have a tete-a-tete with him and his wife Livia 
Giuggioli about tomorrow night. Jokingly, I suggest when he wins to say, I'm speechless. Colin 
patiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, have already mentioned this. He then says that 
others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, 
assuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older models 
as Ford only designs classics. I tell him I made director Charles Ferguson, front runner for the 
financial documentary Inside Job spend $6,000 dollars last week for a new Tom Ford tuxedo. 
In the back room Jennifer Lopez is now seated with Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman. Nominee Helena 
Bonham Carter, her husband Tim Burton and her mother Elena circulate. Celebs have now drifted over from 
The Night Before Party. The star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, 
Camilla Belle, Chace Crawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren Aronofsky, Emma Stone, Jaime Foxx, 
director John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers Morgan, Rachel Zoe, Russell Simmons, Sean Parker, Sir Ben 
Kingsly, Zack Braff , Michelle Williams and Leonardo Dicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. Speech filmmakers are 
functioning on high anxiety. 
Sunday, February 27th, 2011 
Producer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater 
at 3:00pm and nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we arrive at the world's most 
famous red carpet, I guide Donna through the extreme right security check-in to make sure we mingle with 
the nominees and get on camera. I teach her the red carpet hustle which is five steps forward, three 
steps back and one inch behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Bryan Lourd as Sandra Bullock is talking 
to ABC-TV and a billion people see me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three steps 
back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow. As I hook up the back of her dress another billion people see us 
correcting a fashion malfunction. Once again, five steps forward and three steps back. We are now posing 
for the still cameras between Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Our handbags begin buzzing. Countless 
friends are e-mailing us that they just saw us on television. 
James Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip and energetic hosts. The film montages are always the best and the 
set looks great. This is the year of no surprises. Sorkin, Seidler, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, Natalie 
Portman and Colin Firth are totally prepared to receive the gold. Tom Hooper's win leads into Best 
Picture. Harvey is now sitting in Spielberg's seats as Spielberg announces the win. Six months of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029776 
grueling work have finally paid off. King George VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a 
single man who triumphs over adversity. 
The Governor's ball, held above the Kodak Theater, recreates the Mocambo-Ciro's niteries of the 1930's 
and 40's, using a palette of teal and white. Three bands alternate musical styles as hungry guests wolf 
down Wolfgang Puck's delicious food. The winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy 
eight pound gold statues. 
An hour later there is a migration to the famous Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at the Sunset 
Tower Hotel owned by Jeff Klein. One celebrity after another poses in front of the green hedge standing 
in the middle of the circular Vanity Fair logo to record their devotion and support to Graydon and the 
magazine. 
There's a hierarchy of arrival times. The inner circle of Graydon's 150 best friends attend a seated 
dinner and viewing of the show at 5pm. They include Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg, Francis Ford 
Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Tom Ford, Sandy 
Gallin, Mitch Glazer and Kelly Lynch, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L'Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, 
Naomi Watts and Live Schreiber, Wendi Stark, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, George Hammilton, 
Donna Karan and Steve Martin. 
The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9pm. They are Justin Bieber and his date Selena 
Gomez, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Vera Farmiga, Armie Hammer, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Spacey, Charlize 
Theron, Anne Hathaway, Hailee Steinfield,Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Michelle 
Williams, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Jane Fonda after her play, 33 Variations, Melania and 
Donald Trump whom I introduce to David 0. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about The Fighter. Donald 
offers me a ride home on his plane. He is leaving in ten minutes. Too bad James Franco didn't know 
because he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after party. 
Social standings of the rest of the guests are determined by half hour increments. Every other person 
previously mentioned in the story is here. VF's Beth Kseniak and Matt Ullian tell me the list is cut down 
to 800 this year. 
At 11:30pm there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary's house. One 
should note that earlier in the evening Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risque outfit with 
daughter Lourdes in front of the green hedge. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the creme 
de la creme with the promise of fabulous music, dancing and no cameras. Those reported on their dance 
floor include Ryan Phillippe with Amanda Syedfried, who were making out all night and Phillippe's ex-wife 
Reese Witherspoon and new fiancé Jim Toth. They pregnant Natalie Portman and choreographer Benjamin 
Millepied, Mick Jagger, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Ralph Feinnes, Mila Kunis, Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow 
and Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper boogie til dawn. 
A winner's work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper and David Seidler show up at 4:30am at The Four 
Seasons Hotel for a live broadcast on The Today Show with Meredith Vieira. Functioning on an adrenalin 
rush, they are back at the Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah's live broadcast. Leave it 
to Oprah to get the king's last words.

there’s no doubt you’ ll decide to build this fence. But to your dying day, you won’t
be able to look yourself in the mirror and explain why you waited for another 630
Israelis to die first.”

He did eventually start building it, but only in the wake of an act of terrorism
which, even by the standards of this new and still-escalating intifada, was truly
obscene. In March 2002, suicide bombers murdered 30 people, mostly elderly, as
they were celebrating the annual Passover Seder in a hotel dining room in Netanya.
Arik hit back two days later with Israel’s largest military operation on the West
Bank since 1967. Israeli forces retook major Palestinian towns, placed Arafat
under de facto siege in his headquarters in Ramallah and imposed curfews and
closures. In June, the government formally approved the security fence. Still,
another year would pass before the major part of the barrier was in place, by which
time some 500 Israelis had been murdered in the terror attacks. Only then did the
number of casualties begin to fall.

I tried to steer clear of public criticism of Arik’s government. One of the lessons
I’d learned as Prime Minister was how easy it was to second-guess from the
outside. No Prime Minister can act exactly as he might plan or want to. The most
you can do is make sure you understand and analyze the issues and follow your
instincts, experience and conscience to come as near as possible to doing what you
believe is right. You will inevitably make mistakes and misjudgements. I certainly
did. At least some of the criticism I received was deserved. I was at times too
inflexible. I tended to limit my focus to a small group of trusted aides and advisors.
I was less good at schmoozing with — or, perhaps more importantly, delegating to —
others in the government or the party. I suspect it’s no coincidence that the man
who brought me into government in the first place was often criticized for the same
things. By character, instinct and experience, Rabin, too, remained less a politician
than a military man. Yet towards the end of his second period as Prime Minister,
he did get better at delegating to people around him, and creating an atmosphere
that encouraged teamwork, even when he knew he could not accept or act on
everything they might suggest. During my term as Prime Minister, I was much less
good at that.

But another thing Yitzhak and I shared was a determination to set ourselves
specific goals and do everything we could to achieve them. I promised to get the
army out of Lebanon. With the Palestinians, I arrived in office convinced that the
process begun in Oslo was both a huge opportunity and a potential dead-end. I was

Witness payments in criminal trials 
i) No payment or offer of payment to a witness - or any person who

Court Act 1981. 
This prohibition lasts until the suspect has been freed

are otherwise discontinued; or has entered a guilty plea to the court; 
or, in the event of a not guilty plea, the court has announced its 
verdict.

i) Payment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information,

crime in general, must not be made directly or via agents to convicted 
or confessed criminals or to their associates — who may include 
family, friends and colleagues. 
ii) Editors invoking the public interest to justify payment or offers 
would need to demonstrate that there was good reason to believe the 
public interest would be served. If, despite payment, no public 
interest emerged, then the material should not be published.

We should think about a letter to the editor today. 'School' can mean university. Age of 
consent in Florida is complex — see below: 
If you are 16-yrs-old, a sexual relationship with someone 18-24is legal in Florida. The two persons 
involved must be between 16 and 24. 
Florida Statute 794.05 
(1) A person 24 years of age or older who engages in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17  
years of age commits a felony of the second degree.  
So as soon as you turn 16 you are able to have sexual relations. And you can have sexual relations 
with a minor (under 18) until your 24th birthday.  
'Females for JE': Disturbing 
log of telephone calls from 
schoolchildren found in sex 
den of Duke's billionaire

Details of the disturbing lifestyle led by Jeffrey Epstein emerged last night after the Daily Mail 
uncovered logs of telephone messages left at his Florida child sex den. 
Schoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages for the 
58-year-old billionaire friend of Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex offences. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, is named 
in several messages. 
Disturbing: Messages were found in Florida home of Jeffrey Epstein, left. The billionaire, 58, is a 
friend of Prince Andrew, right 
In one left for her or 'Sarah', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come this night 
for the massage'. 
Other messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, contain such phrases as: 'She has 
females for Mr JE' and 'I have a female for him'. 
Another with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just did a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030224 
good one — 18 years. (She spoke to me and said, I love Jeffrey)'. 
The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends including 
the business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and magician David 
Copperfield, referred to as 'Magic David'. 
The sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein's massages, many of which were 
'erotic' and allegedly involved the abused girls. 
The evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into Epstein 
and seen yesterday by the Mail. 
<image.png> 
<image.png> 
Logs: Two of the answer phone messages. Miss Maxwell is asked, right, when a girl should give a 
massage 
One message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.' 
It was left in February 2005 — the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted police to 
Epstein's abuse. 
Another note shows that 'Colleen' phoned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class — will be out in 45 min. 
Last night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers are 
included in the logs. 
One girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about Epstein. 
A man listed only as Darren said: 'I have no comment to make on that.' 
Today, Prince Andrew was embroiled in further controversy as it was revealed Kazakhstan had 
asked for his help in recruiting investors to the country. 
The plea came after the former Soviet Republic's President's son-in-law had bought the Prince's 
former marital home for £3million above the asking price. 
Timur Kulibayev paid £15million for Sunninghill Park but it has remained empty and has been 
allowed to fall into disrepair. 
Last year the Prince told Hello! magazine: 'It was like any property deal between friends.' 
Yesterday he attempted to perform business as usual as he visited an East London school and met 
rail bosses in Canary Wharf 
He steadfastly ignored questions from journalists asking whether he was an 'embarrassment to his 
country' and would resign from his trade ambassador role as he arrived for a briefing from 
business executives at the headquarters of the £15billion train project Crossrail. 
Prince Andrew managed to sell Sunninghill Park for £3million more than the asking price

Jeffrey, 
this may be a long shot to save the Boeing deal, or if you think its a dead deal, disregard this. 
I thought there was a connection between Tarek and myself, I do believe one concern was operation of Boeing with 
flight crew. I know its his problem not ours, but may help make the sale happen,. 
I wrote this email for your review, if you think its worth sending, please critique, and let me know,. thank you: 
Mr. Tarek El Sayed, 
I hope this email finds you well, and believe worth communicating my thoughts to you. 
I was surprised to hear that you decided against the purchase of our Super Boeing 727. I personally thought it was a great match for 
your business needs in Qatar. If for any reason your decision was based on crew issues and charter needs in the Middle East, I'd like 
to share some information that might prove beneficial to making you reconsider this purchase. 
The pilot candidates I have lined up for your interview along with the possibility of David Rodgers joining your flight department 
were as follows: 
(at no time did I disclose location or persons to the following pilot candidates to protect your privacy.) 
Robert Breslin, who is the former Chief Pilot of Mr. Donald Trump, Mr. Breslin flew the Boeing 727 and Boeing 757 owned by Mr 
Trump. Mr Breslin is a fine man of 40 years of age estimate, with extensive VIP Boeing operations. 
James Bartakowski, who has extensive flying experience in the Middle east, Africa and Europe regime. Mr. Bartakowski has also 
been involved in charter operations in Africa and Middle East and has contacted me on several recent occasions with charters for 
our Boeing 727, James has indicated there is the possibility of 40 — 60 hours per month charter operations for larger transport 
category aircraft in your area. I believe there is a growing need for charter in the business community in Qatar and neighboring 
countries. 
Bruce Jafahri, who is a current Boeing 727 captain who lived in Doha for two years, and familiar with international operations of 
Boeing 727 aircraft. Mr. Jafahri currently lives in California and ready for a new opportunity. Bruce is current in the Boeing 727 and 
also flew Captain on the Boeing 747. Well qualified individual and personable. 
Mr. El Sayed, as you have seen during our demo flight, our Boeing 727 is in impeccable condition, quite cabin and will provide many 
years of charter and business flights your company. I believe the large business jet future in Qatar is growing and you will be leading 
its path, and your initial investment in this purchase will not come close with other aircraft options on the market as you may have 
seen already. 
We are currently completing the C2C check on the Boeing, and as we have done in the past, assure you it will be a fine aircraft 
when it leaves Flight Star Maintenance repair facility. 
Sincerely, 
Lawrance Visoski 
Chief Pilot, JEGE Inc.

RECEIVED 
JUL 7 2008 
TOWN CLERK 
Pursuant to Section 18-177 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances (the Code), Trump 
Properties LLC (Trump or Appellant) hereby appeals to the Town Council a certain June 25, 
2008 decision of the Architectural Review Commission (ARCOM) regarding the residence at 
515 North County Road, Palm Beach, Florida (the Residence). 
Statement of Facts 
Trump purchased the Residence on January 6, 2005. The Residence was subject to an 
Agreement between the Town of Palm Beach and the prior owner, Abraham Gosman, dated 
January 31, 1990 and recorded in Official Records Book 6350, Page 1207, of the Public Records 
of Palm Beach County, Florida (Agreement). The Agreement provides that a hedge 
contiguous to North County Road will be maintained and that in the event the hedge is damaged 
or destroyed, it will be replaced. The Agreement refers to the hedge in 9 separate places on the 
first page of the Agreement. The Agreement nowhere refers to, or requires, any trees. 
On April 7, 2008 the Town gave notice of a code violation alleging that the hedge had not been 
maintained or replaced. The original hedge had been destroyed by the hurricanes of 2005 and 
two subsequent replacement hedges had died due to salt spray. Therefore, Trump asked to 
replace the ficus hedge with silver buttonwood hedge material. The Town staff advised that such 
decision would have to be made by ARCOM. The Appellant appeared before ARCOM on May 
28, 2008. ARCOM approved silver buttonwood hedge material. ARCOM also requested that 
trees be planted and requested a tree planting plan. Trump planted the hedge in accordance with 
the Agreement. 
Trump returned to the Code Enforcement Board meeting on June 19, 2008. That Board deferred 
further consideration of the matter pending plantings requested by ARCOM. 
Trump appeared before ARCOM on June 25, 2008 and (a) sought reconsideration of 
July 3, 2008 
Page 2 
the request for trees and (b) proved that the hedge that had been planted satisfactorily screened 
the house and complied with the terms of the Agreement. 
Grounds for Appeal 
The action of ARCOM was inconsistent with and not in conformity with the provisions of the 
Code and the Agreement which ARCOM and the Code Enforcement Board seek to enforce. The 
grounds for appeal include the following: 
1. ARCOM erroneously interpreted the Agreement to require not only a hedge as specified 
by the Agreement, but to also require the planting of 20 trees behind the hedge. The 
Agreement does not require any planting of trees. 
2. ARCOM denied the request by Trump to reconsider its position that trees must be 
planted. 
3. ARCOM directed that the portion of the existing hedge which was undamaged, located 
north of the driveway into the property, be partially or fully destroyed and replaced with 
silver buttonwood hedge material for purposes of symmetry. Such a requirement is not 
in conformity with the Agreement. 
4. ARCOM abused its discretion in denying Appellant's request since it is unreasonable to 
require new and additional planting outside of the clearly limited requirements of the 
Agreement. 
5. Any action by the Code Enforcement Board or ARCOM with regard to the Agreement is 
improper and inconsistent with the Town Code since the Code Enforcement Board can 
only enforce Code provisions and not contractual agreements, notwithstanding any 
language to the contrary in the Agreement. 
Trump requests that this appeal be heard by the Town Council at the meeting on 
August 11,2008.

Hierarchical Temporal Memory architecture.

15.3.3 Dual Networks

Finally, if both hierarchical and heterarchical structures exist in an Atomspace, then both ECAN
and PLN will naturally blend them together, because hierarchical and heterarchical links will
feed into their link-creation processes and naturally be combined together to form new links.
This will tend to produce a structure called a dual network, in which a hierarchy exists, along
with a rich network of heterarchical links joining nodes in the hierarchy, with a particular density
of links between nodes on the same hierarchical level. The dual network structure will emerge
without any explicit engineering oriented toward it, simply via the existence of hierarchical
and heterarchical networks, and the propensity of ECAN and PLN to be guided by both the
hierarchical and heterarchical networks. The existence of a natural dual network structure in
both linguistic and sensorimotor data will help the formation process along, and then creative
cognition will enrich the dual network yet further than is directly necessitated by the external
world.

capable to taking over Gaza. But what then, I asked. Unless we were prepared to
resume open-ended Israeli control, we’d be left with no one to run Gaza
afterwards. The obvious candidate, Egypt, was even less interested than we were in
assuming responsibility for the more than one-and-a-half million Palestinians who
lived there. I doubted that even Arafat would have been ready to do so. But
relations had only worsened, since his death in 2004, between the Fatah old guard
in the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank and the Hamas overlords in Gaza. I
doubted very much that Abu Mazen would want to get involved. I did send an aide
to see him to ask whether, in principle, he was open to reassuming control of Gaza
following an Israeli takeover. His answer was unsurprising and unequivocal: no.

I secured cabinet support for the more limited aim of restoring a period of calm
for Israeli citizens in the south. I said the military operation had to be as sharp and
short as possible, and end with some kind of political understanding that the
rockets would stop for a significant period of time. The final plan was presented to
ministers a few days before the operation. It would begin with surprise air strikes
and a naval bombardment, followed by a limited ground incursion to hit remaining
Hamas targets outside of the major refugee camps, which I was determined to
avoid. The whole operation was intended to last for two weeks at the most.
Hopefully, closer to a week, with diplomatic efforts through Egypt to secure a
lasting cease-fire and, ideally, prevent Hamas from resupplying its rocket
stockpiles through its smuggling tunnels from the Sinai.

When we launched Operation Cast Lead on the morning of December 27,
nearly all the Hamas forces were where we’d expected them to be. Two waves of
air strikes, with over a hundred jets and attack helicopters, killed 350 Hamas
fighters. We destroyed Hamas’s headquarters and dozens of its government and
police installations. The attacks continued in the days that followed. We took a
range of actions designed to minimize civilian casualties. We dropped leaflets
before bombing sorties, phoned residents, and fired light missiles before heavier
ordnance was used. Still, I realized that civilian casualties were unavoidable — if
only because Hamas, like Hizbollah in Lebanon, was deliberately firing its rockets
from civilian areas, sometimes even near schools or hospitals. Civilian casualties
were obviously tragic in themselves. They also made it inevitable that the longer
the operation went on, the more likely we were to face international criticism, and
diplomatic pressure to bring it to an end. That was an additional reason I had
insisted that the operation be well defined and time-limited.

equilibrium is subgame perfect, a solution concept used to rule out these kinds of concerns
in settings where there is a high degree of rationality [15].

We might wonder whether CWOL will emerge in a population of players who are not
rational, but are evolving or learning their strategies. There are two reasons to suspect
it will not emerge. First, CWOL may be susceptible to the invasion of mutants. In
particular, the concern is that a player 2 mutant might arise that does not attend to
whether player 1 looks, rendering looking irrelevant. This mutant’s fitness is no higher or
lower than the incumbent strategy, so may grow by drift. Subsequently, a player 1 mutant
which looks and defects when the temptation is high would have a fitness advantage and
proliferate. While the player 2 mutant would then start dying off since it would now have
lower fitness than the incumbent, it is not clear that it would do so fast enough for the
player 1 mutant to also die off, returning to the CWOL equilibrium. Second, CWOL may
be stable but have such a small basin of attraction that it will never emerge. In particular,
there are three other equilibria to consider, which can be seen in figure 2. The first is
comprised of the strategy pair where player 1 always defects, and player 2 always exits
(which we refer to as the ALLD equilibrium). It is a Nash Equilibrium for all parameter
values. The second is the strategy pair where player 2 exits if player 1 defects, and player

1 cooperates with or without looking (we refer to this as the CWL equilibrium). It is a

Nash equilibrium when —— > cp. In fact, there are many more Nash Equilibria, where

1—w —
the population mixes between different strategies.

Consequently, we employ computer simulations of the replicator dynamic to explore
the evolutionary dynamics of the envelope game. The replicator dynamic is the standard

model for evolutionary dynamics [16, 17, 18, 19], and also models learning dynamics such

as reinforcement learning or prestige-biased imitation [20]. It describes strategies evolving

104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *96

In view of the Department's existing notifications and provision of services before charges are filed under the VRRA, it is hard

to conceive how any viable claim could be made that it would be difficult to provide similar rights under the CVRA. The four
rights that would be potentially in play before charging would be the right to reasonable protection, the right to fair treatment,
and the right to confer with prosecutors, along with the predicate right to notice of these rights. 7!? The VRRA already requires
the Department to provide reasonable protection, so this would not be an expanded obligation. 7!3 Similarly, the Guidelines
already require prosecutors to confer with victims about plea agreements (the most common situation where victims want to
confer), so it is hard to imagine how extending this right would create any undue burden. 7!4 Additionally, the right to fair
treatment could only be a problem if the Department [*97] wanted to treat victims unfairly. Given its repeated and professed
commitment to crime victims, here too this obligation should not be burdensome. And finally, with regard to providing notice
of CVRA rights to victims, the fact that the Department currently provides notice of VRRA rights indicates that it should not be
difficult to provide notice of CVRA rights as well.

Indeed, it is possible that the Department's notification letters under the VRRA already include this information. Interestingly,
in the Epstein case, the FBI notified Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two that they had rights in the criminal
justice process. As early as June 7, 2007 - more than three months before it concluded a nonprosecution agreement with
Epstein - the U.S. Attorney's Office sent a notice to Jane Doe Number One stating your case is under investigation. *!> The
notice also informed Jane Doe Number One that as a victim and/or witness of a federal offense, you have a number of rights.
716 Among the rights that the U.S. Attorney's Office told Jane Doe that she possessed was the reasonable right to confer with
the attorney for the United States in the case. *!7 Of course, she would not have had those rights if she was not covered by the
CVRA. The FBI therefore apparently assumed that the CVRA already applied in the Epstein case. It was only later, when the
matter went into litigation, that the Department of Justice reversed course. This change in course underscores the problems
arising out of the OLC memorandum and the Department's current interpretation of the CVRA.

D. STATE LAW EXTENSION OF PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS

The focus of this Article so far has been crime victims' rights in the federal system. But in concluding, it is instructive to note
how a number of states offer parallel rights for crime victims, including the right to confer with prosecutors. In fact, several
states have extended such rights prior to formally filing of charges against defendants - without reported difficulty, so far as we
are aware. This confirms our inference that extending CVRA rights to crime victims before the formal filing of criminal
charges is both feasible and desirable.

A general overview of state laws illustrates the broad protections afforded to victims in state criminal justice systems. Nearly
two-thirds of states have adopted constitutional provisions to protect victims throughout [*98] the criminal justice process.
218 Moreover, every state has adopted a statute that either enforces its constitutional amendment or creates independent
statutory rights for crime victims. *!? As a result, state legislatures and state employees have attempted to give victims a voice
in the criminal justice process across the country.

103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *899

This basic overview - drawn from a substantial scholarly literature - paints a somewhat contradictory picture. On the one hand,
the primary story is one of longstanding underenforcement - a combination of explicit legal policies, practical evidence-
gathering and proof challenges, and cultural biases resulted in a notoriously weak response to sexual assaults by state criminal
justice systems. On the other hand, there is a story, over the last forty years or so, of wide-ranging success in achieving reforms
on several fronts - substantive and procedural law, institutional design, and resource allocation - designed to improve
enforcement capacity. In other words, U.S. jurisdictions made substantial progress against an ingrained tradition of
underenforcement without turning to any model of enforcement redundancy - federalization, private prosecution, or judicial
review. That is more than state justice systems were ever able to do with regard to local government corruption, where the
remedy instead was the rise of federal criminal law enforcement.

And yet, few seem to consider this reform story a success. !*8 The data on underreporting by victims, low arrest rates by
police, and charging rates by prosecutors (along with the rape kit [*900] testing backlog) make it easy to view state criminal
justice systems as failing to achieve adequate enforcement responses to sexual assaults despite the scope and gravity of the
problem - 124,000 offenses reported to police in 2015, and 431,000 assault reports estimated by the National Crime Victim
Survey. 189

This story of reform, its decidedly limited success, and the responses to that record all reveal insights about the prospects for
redressing underenforcement through redundancy in this context. Intersecting feminist, victim rights, and rape-law-reform
movements have achieved some remarkable reforms through the political process over the last four decades. U.S. criminal
justice, like U.S. public law generally, is responsive to popular sentiment, well-organized reform movements, and interest
groups. !?° But these movements never sought any mechanism of enforcement redundancy, and federal and state lawmakers
never seriously considered one. Even now, when offense definitions, victim rights, evidentiary rules, and organizational
changes in law enforcement agencies offer few plausible options for further improvement, there is effectively no sign of
interest in private prosecution and judicial or administrative oversight. Instead, the sole focus of further innovation to address
endemic underenforcement of sexual assault offenses is the federal government. And most federal policy - and policy proposals
- stop short of expanding federal law to cover sexual assaults now within the jurisdiction solely of state courts. !°! A notable

forces, as well as against each other. The most prominent of them, the Free Syrian
Army, is not strong enough to defeat Assad’s forces. Even if the US provides the FSA
with light weapons, this opposition group is outnumbered by hundreds of
thousands against Assad’s army. Even according to the most exaggerated estimates,
the size of the FSA does not exceed 20,000 soldiers, while Assad’s army counts as

many as 400,000, equipped with heavy and sophisticated weapons.

Due to the uprising, different extremist military groups have been able to cross the
border and enter Syria. One of the leading armed groups, Al-Nusra Front, an affiliate
of the world’s largest terrorist organizations Al-Qaeda, has been included by the US
in the international terrorism blacklist. It is important to note that these rebels have
many supply channels, making it impossible for the US to control which group will
be receiving the weapons, creating the risk of the US arms being used by terrorists

against America or its allies in the region.

Moreover, after two years of fighting against the regime, the opposition forces have
started to turn guns on each other, fighting for power and territory. This
significantly undermines their ability to form a united government, decreasing the
probability of a strong alternative force. Providing military groups with weapons

will only escalade the violence, lead to more massacre and _destruction.

Far from being a change agent, once Obama took office, he doubled down on the Bush economic agenda, kept Bush’s key
economic advisors and thereby created further down-drafts for the economy.

The simple fact that absolutely leaps off these charts is the abysmal record attained by the 7+ years of the Obama
Administration. To be fair, the decline began when “W’” took office and accelerated greatly when Bush, aided by Geithner and
Bernanke, bailed everyone out and spent huge sums of U.S. resources trying to stimulate the economy—all to no avail. To
me, the circumstances today are almost identical to those of 1980—16 years of bad economics about to be followed by a
political renaissance.

For Hillary Clinton, the Obama record on the economy will be her biggest negative come November. And the very fact that
she actually sought out and embraces this legacy speaks volumes about her judgement.

Ill. All Elections are Referenda on Incumbents

The Mood of the Country — The History of the Gallup Poll

Whether fair or not, Hillary Clinton is viewed as a Democratic insider and establishment regular. As such, she benefits greatly
in her ability to raise money and attract superdelegate support. But, there’s also a downside to being a Democratic insider
and establishment regular today. When the electorate is unhappy with the direction the country is heading, she'll also be
blamed right along with the President and other members of his party. This is exactly what happened to the Presidencies of
Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Bush Sr., Bush “W” and presumptively Obama.

If any one of you remembers the contested Democratic primary of 1980 when Senator Ted Kennedy challenged his party’s
sitting President, you will be reminded of the current Democratic primary where Bernie Sanders continues to humiliate Hillary
Clinton, primary after primary. While Senator Kennedy lost in his quest to secure the Democratic nomination, he clearly
exposed all the weaknesses of President Carter, just as Senator Bernie Sanders is exposing Hilary Clinton’s vulnerability.
This can’t be good news for Mrs. Clinton.

For quite some time now, | have been using the Gallup poll question, “Are you satisfied with the way things are going?” as my
measure of the electorate’s level of discontent. This question has been posed by Gallup for years and years and, thus, the

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:

- Deceleration in Google Website revenue: There could be modest revenue
pressure due to YouTube boycott impact, and/or ad shift to Facebook. One SEM
suggested a modest uptick in advertising spend on maps, which could be a positive
in 2017.

¢ TAC to distribution partners: Rising TAC rate (Apple, Samsung} could mitigate
potential gross revenue upside in the higher margin mobile search segment.

¢ Growth investments could drag on margins: Investments in Google Cloud,
hardware, and YouTube could be higher than we expect, which could negatively
impact core Google margins and raise concerns on long-term sustainable margin
levels.

* YouTube/Display Network commentary: While we do not expect full resolution on
the YouTube/Display Network issues, management’s tone will likely impact
expectations for timing of a fix, corresponding costs, magnitude of the boycott
losses, and time to recover lost ad spend.

¢ Stock comp timing shift could cause some GAAP lumpiness: Shift in timing of
annual stock-based comp grants could impact 1Q EPS, but should be offset with
lower relative cost in 2H17.

Top 1Q data point:

Our early 1Q checks (pre quarter end) have been mostly positive, but most checks did

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018635.txt,"So yeah, bondage -- rope, cages, etc. -- is not so much my thing. But there's one phrase
I absolutely love: predicament bondage. Predicament bondage is usually presented in a
very elaborate way: for example, a submissive might be tied up with ropes binding him
such that his arms are in pain -- but if he moves his arms then his legs will be in pain. It's
a predicament! And it's bondage! Whee! Predicament bondage!

However, it doesn't have to be elaborate to be predicament bondage. I'm not into rope
obstacle courses, but I started loving the phrase predicament bondage after a friend
went to a workshop run by Fetish Diva Midori and reported back. He said:

Midori had two pitchers of water, or maybe a pitcher and a glass. She told us, This is
the simplest form of predicament bondage, and she had the demo submissive hold his
hands straight out at shoulder height. Then she placed the water in his hands. The
submissive had to keep holding the water; if he failed, he knew he would be failing
Midori. But there was never any threat of Midori's wrath if he failed her. In fact, she
spoke as if she was on his side, part of his team. In many ways, her sympathy for his
plight made it all the more cruel, because she was the one doing it to him.

She explained this. She knew that his sense of disappointment in failing” her was worse
than anything she could actually do to him.

So, the predicament in that case was the submissive's increasing arm agony vs. his fear of
failing Midori. For me, that concept is infinitely hotter than a rope obstacle course.
Although for me, in practice, I'd also want the pain to be a bit more... um... personal.

te Ok ok

The first time someone flogged me, I had no idea what he was going to do beforehand; he
and I had the strongest dominant/submissive dynamic I've ever felt, and I put myself in
his hands with almost-total trust. A night came around when I felt that itch under my
skin, the dark burn in the back of my mind... I knew I had to go see him. I wasn't hugely
experienced, but I knew exactly what that slow burn meant.

It was late. He was in bed, and I lay down next to him. I think... I said slowly, I want
you to hurt me. A lot.

I felt him tense beside me.
Why? he asked.
I didn't look at him. Why do you ask me questions when you already know the answer?”

Sometimes I just want to hear you say it, he said, and stood up. Take off your clothes
and get on your knees.”

I caught my breath; did as he said. When I felt the ends of the flogger trail lightly down
my back, I wasn't even sure what the soft sensation meant, but I was already trembling
anyway. I am surprised by my memory of how much it hurt when he hit me. These days,
I don't think of floggers as especially painful, but then again, I seem to recall that he left
more marks than I'm used to. (I loved taking off my shirt and examining the bruises in the
mirror. I glowed for days, afterwards.) So maybe there was something particular about
what he did, or about his materials. Or maybe it's just that it was my first time.

Pulitzer Prize

A Pulitzer Prizes is to the arts what a Nobel Prize is to science. Again
the Prize was the result of a bequest. They are awarded in the fields of
music, art and literature. Unlike Nobel Prizes, where there are no public
nominations and you might wait a lifetime for the phone call, you enter
your name for a Pulitzer Prize. Most people associate the term Pulitzer
Prize winner with journalism, but about 25 Pulitzers are awarded each
year. You must be a US citizen to enter.

Turing Award

Originally set up by the Association of Computer Machinery, this award
comes with prize money of $250,000, supported by Google and Intel,
and goes to a person who significantly advanced computer science or
artificial intelligence in the previous year. It is considered the Nobel Prize
for computing.

XPRIZE

XPRIZEs are awarded for technology and bear the democratic stamp
of the Internet age. Anyone can propose a challenge but they must also

parties you’ve mentioned, they actually have close ties with Putin, who is the promoter of
this big danger, so I'd like to know your thoughts about this and how you’re going to deal
with it.

Bannon: Could you summarize that for me?

Harnwell: The first question was, you'd reference the Front National and UKIP as
having elements that are tinged with the racial aspect amidst their voter profile, and the
questioner was asking how you intend to deal with that aspect.

Bannon: I don’t believe I said UKIP in that. I was really talking about the parties on the
continent, Front National and other European parties.

I’m not an expert in this, but it seems that they have had some aspects that may be anti-
Semitic or racial. By the way, even in the tea party, we have a broad movement like this,
and we've been criticized, and they try to make the tea party as being racist, etc., which
it’s not. But there’s always elements who turn up at these things, whether it’s militia guys
or whatever. Some that are fringe organizations. My point is that over time it all gets kind
of washed out, right? People understand what pulls them together, and the people on the
margins I think get marginalized more and more.

I believe that you'll see this in the center-right populist movement in continental Europe.
I’ve spent quite a bit of time with UKIP, and I can say to you that I’ve never seen anything
at all with UKIP that even comes close to that. I think they've done a very good job of
policing themselves to really make sure that people including the British National Front
and others were not included in the party, and I think you’ve seen that also with tea party
groups, where some people would show up and were kind of marginal members of the tea
party, and the tea party did a great job of policing themselves early on. And I think that’s
why when you hear charges of racism against the tea party, it doesn’t stick with the
American people, because they really understand.

I think when you look at any kind of revolution — and this is a revolution — you always
have some groups that are disparate. I think that will all burn away over time and you'll

see more of a mainstream center-right populist movement.

Program has, studying these brains, found slower reaction times, defects in divided

patterns of odor reception called cacosmia or dysosmia. Using brain wave and
cardiac interbeat interval data as markers, Bell reports the increase in the amount of

Mid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel, where I have stayed for
thirty years. As the housekeepers unpack my bags upstairs I peek into
the Polo Lounge and find icon Warren Beatty in a booth. He motions me
over to meet an Egyptian fashion editor from Cairo. I say, Warren, you
are a little late to visit Cairo. I tell him I'm rooting for Annette
and love her film “The Kids Are All Right”. Warren tells me “The Social
Network” will win.

This year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I am now shown
to a very very very small room, the size of a broom closet.
Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am moved. The
housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes flying. I calm down. The
hotel is sold out. I get someone else's room. Another poor schmuck
checking in downstairs will get the broom closet.

It is cold, grey and rainy. Taffata, organdy and embroidered silk
evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters and fur coat
and head to Arianna Huffington's Mediterranean house in Beverly Hills
where Wendi Murdoch and Arianna are hosting a party for Tom Freston's
wife, the beautiful blond Kathy. The book is called Veganist: Lose
Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World. A perfect book for Monks.

Arianna has just sold the Huffington Post for to AOL to $315 million
dollars and rumored to have personally landed around $2@ million. She is
euphoric as she greets Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other
drenched power players ushered in under umbrellas include Disney's Bob
Iger and wife Willow Bay, Fox’s Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and
journalist daughter Chloe Malle, Google's Eric Schmidt, Oliver Stone
avoiding questions about Charlie Sheen and escorting his daughter Tara,
Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, Tracey Ullman, CBS’s Les
Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad Grey and fiancé
Cassandra Marc and Jeff Bezos. Hors d'oeuvres include pigs in blankets,
a food group not mentioned in Kathy's book.

The party action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus's home in the neighborhood
for “True Grit’s” Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on the way in
and he says, Keep me on your list. Is he kidding? Sunrise and Mark
Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, Focus Feature’s James Shamus, Nancy Meyers and
John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie Steinfeld is there with her
parents. I am trying to fix her up with Justin Bieber. She giggles,

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018297.txt,"showed how groups could suck power into themselves from networks, along
invisible lines, and animate themselves as if by connection to electricity. The
protesters and terrorists understood power that existed simply because of
connectivity. They understood how easy it was to connect. And so they had an
instinct that eluded the comfortable men in the palaces. The usual reaction of
authorities - Round up the usual suspects - didn’t work because, as Castells noted,
“The usual suspects were networks.” You couldn’t arrest a network.

3

Before we can go much further in figuring out how network power might be used -
to close up those six worrisome paradoxes, to create massive new companies (or
invest in them), to rebuild our politics —- ] think we need a picture of sorts in our
heads of this new landscape. What does a network look like? How does it’s design
affect its operation? Yes, it’s true you can’t arrest a network. But can you say
something about howit’s different? Can you spot the parts that are dangerous?
When someone like Castells says to us, “Power is moving,” what does that mean
exactly? Where is it going? What I want to do now is begin to assemble an image of a
network, and to show what that sort of linked design tells us about where we are
now and where we're going. Then, with such a picture, firmly in our minds, we can
ask just what these networks are for, after all, and how they might be used.

It is an old chestnut of historians and anthropologists that power - the ability to
make or cause things to happen - is often determined by structure. When | say,
“Superpower” | am painting a picture of the international system with a single word.
“Highway,” does the same - and tells you something about logistics, trucks,
economic power. Or “City.” This is why “org charts” have such a decisive power.
Think of the map of power in your family or your office or a nation. Who makes the
decisions? Why? The way we bottle up our lives in firms or congresses or
universities flavors just about every other decision we make®®. An imperial CEO,
prone to visions and control creates a different sort of firm than a boss who moves
among his employees nearly as an equal. An army that moves from the top down is
different than one that lives, as Mao said of the Chinese guerilla forces that mastered
the country against steep odds in 1949, “as if they were fish and the people were
water.” Power is always packed into structures of some sort. Emperors, kings,
presidents and congresses all reflect certain arrangements. But those arrangements
change; power moves. You can see leaders struggle with this constant shifting:
Think of the “Englightened Despotism” of the 18 Century as Frederick II of Prussia,
Joseph II of the Hapsburgs and Catherine IJ in St. Petersburg each struggled to marry
the then-new ideas of liberty with older instincts of control. History is, in one sense,
nothing but the tale of the movement of power. Once the idea of an Assyrian king
emperor was new, as was the notion of a President or a Pope. History is paced by
the arrival of new species of all sorts; and by the death of others. This is as true for
institutions as is it for bugs. With this caveat: No one gives up power easily.

facts about USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers to provide context for
how its financials have reached their present state.

We did not base this analysis on proprietary data. Our observations come
from publicly available information, and we use the tools of basic financial
analysis to interpret it. Forecasts generally come from 3rd-party agencies like the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO). For US policy makers, the timing of material

We Focus on Federal,

Not State & Local Government Data

e Federal / State & Local Governments Share Different Responsibilities

— Federal government is financially responsible for all or the majority of Defense, Social
Security, Medicare and Interest Payments on federal debt and coordinates / shares
funding for public investment in education / infrastructure.

— State & local governments are financially responsible for all or the majority of Education,
Transportation (Road Construction & Maintenance), Public Safety (Police / Fire
Protection / Law Courts / Prisons) and Environment & Housing (Parks & Recreation /
Community Development / Sewerage & Waste Management).

— Federal / state & local governments share financial responsibility in Medicaid and
Unemployment Insurance.

e We Focus on the Federal Government

— State and local governments face many similar long-term financial challenges and may
ultimately require federal assistance. To be sure, the size of state & local government
budget deficits ($70 billion’ in aggregate in F2009) and debt-to-GDP ratio (7%? on
average in F2008) pales by comparison to the federal government's ($1.3 trillion budget
deficit, 62% debt-to-GDP ratio in F2010). But these metrics may understate state & local
governments’ financial challenges by 50% or more® because they exclude the long-term
cost of public pension and other post employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities.

Note: 1) Per National Conference of State Legislatures, State fiscal years ends in June. $70B aggregate excludes deficits

from Puerto Rico ($3B deficits in F2009). 2) Debt-to-GDP ratio per Census Bureau State & Local Government Finance; 3)

Calculation based on the claim that $1T of collective short fall in State & local government pension and OPEB funding

Where is causation worried about? Nearly everywhere. Anyone
in the social sciences or in any practical discipline worries about
causation.

So, should departments be organized around the twelve cognitive
processes? Probably not.

It would be difficult to do and everyone would be against it. It
is difficult to change what has always been in place. But those who
study diagnosis would benefit from being around others who were
doing diagnosis all the time. And those who are worried about de-
scriptions would do well to hang around others doing the same. But
it doesn’t matter that much, really. In a research university, professors
really just talk with people who are doing more or less exactly what
they themselves are doing. Departmental seminars are social gather-
ings more than intellectual meeting places, since a talk on one subspe-
cialty rarely interests those who work in different subspecialties in the
same department.

But none of this really matters. Our research universities (of which
there are maybe 50 in the United States) are doing very well, and my
problem is not with them. It is with the institutions that claim to be
educating our youth for the future and that employ professors who
have a Ph.D. from a research university and who really wish they were
still there. The research universities serve as professor training grounds
that train many more professors who can do research than we pos-
sibly could need. These people then become professors at institutions
where hardly any student intends to get a Ph.D., but they continue to
teach the same Ph.D. training curriculum that they studied.

This has got to stop. The problem is not so much the universities
as the high schools, of course. As long as college is seen as a professor
training ground, then high school is seen as way to get into the profes-
sor training ground, and a nonsensical system evolves that trains high
school kids to study what professors need to know. This has to end.

When students sign up for psychology at their university, they
want to know what is wrong with them and their parents, and instead
they study how to do experiments because that is what their profes-
sors learned to do in graduate school. When students take computer
science in college, they want to learn to use the computer, but instead
they study the mathematics of computation because that is what their
professor does. When kids study chemistry in college, they are doing
it in order to become doctors for the most part, but instead of learning

Happy birthday, I remember the few I had spent with you, good memories! 
The problem is that you may appreciate my support but that doesn't help me. Yes, I told you I can't have 
people coming here to ask about you and ex pals.... My landlord may shoot them. He is pissed. I need your 
help. Out of all the people you should be helping is someone who actually genuinely cared about you.i realize 
you're living the good life and I'm not your concern, but if you really appreciated my support then you'd help 
me otherwise I don't know what I'll do.

"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011644.txt,"Dan began the next morning’s briefing with a stage-by-stage review of how
the operation would unfold. But just as he was getting to the detail of the
motorcade attack, I felt a young sayeret officer tap me on the shoulder. Kuti had
phoned to say I was to go see him at the kirya. “He said immediately,” the
officer added, “and not to discuss it with anyone. Just to tell Dan Shomron that
you’ve been taken out of the operation.”

To say I was surprised would be an understatement. But I allowed myself to
believe the decision to “take me out” could still be reversed. Not only was I
ready to command the critical first part of the operation. I believed I was best
placed to ensure it succeeded. I felt that was best for Yoni, too, due to tensions
inside the sayeret of which both of us were aware.

There was no officer to whom I was closer than Yoni. He had extraordinary
strengths as a soldier: in the Six-Day War, in 1973, and afterwards when, with
my encouragement, he’d taken command of a tank battalion in the north left
almost in tatters from the Yom Kippur War. But there was more to him as well.
I used to marvel how at the end of 16 hours of sayeret training, he could spend a
further two or three reading history, or a novel or poetry. He always struggled
between the impulse to devote his life to fighting for the State of Israel, and to
studying, reading and living as a more “normal” family man.

His drive to serve, and to excel, was stronger. Tuti Goodman, the young
woman he’d met as a teenager and married, understood what drew him to a life
in uniform. But that wasn’t what she had signed up for. At one point, Yoni
asked me to speak to Tuti. She asked me to speak to him. I did my best to
explain each to the other. But the gap between what each of them wanted for
their lives was just too wide. Before the 1973 war, they’d separated. After the
war, professionally fulfilled but personally shattered, Yoni heard that I'd found
an apartment in Ramat Hasharon, and he asked me if there were other flats in
the building. It turned out that the owner of the flat below ours was willing to
rent it. Yoni snapped it up.

Over the past year or so, with Yoni leading the sayeret and me in the kirya,
we’d seen more of each another. For the first time in years, he seemed to have
found a sense of peace, and fulfillment, in his personal life. That was in large

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032002.txt,"Back on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing.

Oliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard Don Marron
saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan hangs out watching
boyfriend Shia work.

At sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He loves it.)

Chuck Pfieffer plants a Page Six item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film.

Thursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street

Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese dinner.
Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing
himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines.

Monday, November 9, 25 Broadway

One hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the
Alzheimer’s Ball, a grand charity event.

Susan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join
Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly
Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer
Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN’s Felicia
Taylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero.

Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at
break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa
with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are
alternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It’s a madhouse of
excitement.

We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins.
Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor
commanding two million dollars an episode of “Two and a Half Men.”

Oliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the
camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their
concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, Action as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an
easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and
my marriage has become a threesome.

Sensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with
Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each
other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces.

Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and

Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia’s boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in
the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia’s real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate

test of fire with courage and wisdom and his indomitable spirit — the very
essence of the spirit that made possible the operation in which he would lose his
life.” Because, make no mistake, I said: beyond the weapons used, the people
who participated, the training and exercises before the fleet of Hercules had
taken off; beyond the fine balance required in the planning, execution, and
decision-making; it was “this spirit, this essence, that was tested at Entebbe.”

When I saw Yoni’s family afterwards, though they thanked me for my
remarks, I could see that they were still bleeding inside. I am sure that affected
they way they related to Bruria. Even before Yoni met her, he had told me how
hard his parents were finding his separation from Tutti. Bruria attended the
funeral and the sh/oshim. But she didn’t sit with the family. I think that with the
shock of his death, mixed with the pride they felt at his emergence as a national
hero, they found it difficult to include her, a woman they hardly knew, in their
mourning.

A few weeks later, I go a call from the Netanyahu family’s lawyer, Erwin
Shimron. It was an odd, rambling conversation. He seemed to insinuate that, as
her and Yoni’s neighbor and friend, I was encouraging the unwelcome idea that
Bruria was part of the immediate circle of the bereaved, that this mere girlfriend
was somehow his widow. He wanted me to withdraw whatever mantle I might
be providing, and help separate her from Yoni and his legacy. He went so far as
to say that one reason he was calling me was because he didn’t want to have to
take “legal steps” to make that happen. I saw no point in getting into an
argument. I sensed that, while it would take time for the grief felt by those
closest to Yoni to begin to heal, the issue would gradually resolve itself. But I
saw even less point in leading the lawyer to believe I would do what he was
suggesting.

“Mr Shimron,” I told him. “I knew Yoni. I know Bruria. I do not know you.
But I have a musical ear. I don’t like the undertone I hear in what you’ve been
saying. I’ve seen them close up. Bruria gave Yoni, at a critical time in his life,
probably more warmth than he ever received from any other human being.”

American forces removed from the
kingdom, for example, Qatar was eager
to compensate by hosting a more robust
American command presence in the
region.

The Arab uprisings and subsequent GCC
intervention in Bahrain have turned the
tables, making Saudi security backing a
necessity for the smaller Gulf
monarchies. From their perspective,
American forces are clearly more capable
than Saudi forces, but given the
alignment of their interests, Riyadh is a
more reliable security partner. Gulf
leaders and military commanders in the
coming decade will be focused on how to
avoid following in Mubarak's footsteps.
Part of minimizing that risk will involve
decreasing security dependency on the
United States. Gulf leaders have to worry
that if push comes to shove, the
Americans will throw them under a bus
just like they did to Mubarak.

whether that would even be possible to strike before the Iranians entered their
“zone of immunity” — the point at which the amount of damage we could do to
their nuclear program would be too negligible to be worth the operational, political
and diplomatic risks from such an attack. In the early months, my priority was to
ensure we at least had a military option. A full year before joining Bibi’s
government, as Defense Minister under Olmert, I’d first tried to put an operational
plan in place, only to find that the lack of heavy munitions and refuelling aircraft
made it impossible. That was especially frustrating because at that point, our
experts calculated that a successful strike could have set back the Iranian nuclear
effort by about six years. Given the Iranians’ knowledge we could attack again,
and their need to restart clandestine efforts to secure key components abroad, that
meant a very real prospect of ending the nuclear program altogether. On joining
Bibi’s government, I began working, both with the kirya and the engineers and
technological experts in our military industries, to make sure we had the weaponry
and equipment, and an operational plan for a surgical strike. It was not until mid-
2010, a year into Bibi’s government, that I was confident we’d reached that point,
in part thanks to Israeli-produced heavy bombs and tanker aircraft. Our experts
estimated we would still be able to set back the Iranian nuclear efforts by up to
four years, almost certainly enough to end them indefinitely.

Yet making military action possible proved to be the easy part. The question
now became whether we should be prepared to launch a strike against Iran’s
nuclear facilities. Answering it was like a contest of three-dimensional chess,
involving both an internal debate among Israel’s political and military leadership
and discussions with an Obama administration whose priority remained to
negotiate an end to Iran’s nuclear program. On major security decisions in Israel,
two ministers always mattered the most: the Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
Neither Bibi nor I doubted we had to ready to strike if that proved necessary. Nor
did Foreign Minister Lieberman. Even for us, it was an option to be considered
only when all other ways to rein in the Iranians were failing. We also agreed on
two other preconditions. We would have to secure international legitimacy, most of
all from the Americans, for what would be a clear act of self-defense. And we’d
need to demonstrate an imperative urgency to act, with the approach of the “zone
of immunity” that would take any military option off the table for good.

Ideally, we hoped the US-led campaign of economic and diplomatic pressure
would get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, as Libya had done in the wake of

points of view, teaching what description is about not how to work
PowerPoint.

THIRD YEAR IN COLLEGE AND BEYOND

Now what next?

After these 2 years, what will students be able to do and what
should the faculty do with them? Clearly, faculty, as I have pointed
out, want to teach what interests them—their own research subspe-
cialties. Faculty will want to continue to insist on there being majors.
Students should not have to be forced to select a major subject because
majors (and, of course, subjects) are at the root of the problem.

Whose needs do majors satisfy? Faculty like them because the fac-
ulty can determine that to be a major in X students must know all
of its aspects, and then insist that students, take obscure courses that
they would not want to take. This is another way of making sure that
faculty get to teach whatever they want to teach.

An alternative would be to let students specialize in a cognitive
process, like diagnosis, and an area where they have become knowl-
edgeable to which diagnosis applies, like financial diagnosis or behav-
ioral diagnosis. Every student who majors in business doesn’t really
want to, or need to, know every aspect of business, and a student who
majors in psychology doesn’t need to study clinical, social, animal,
and developmental psychology, if what he is interested in is diagnos-
ing personality disorders, for example.

Let students specialize, if they want—they shouldn’t be made to,
but let them specialize in processes that they might want to become
proficient at. We shouldn’t force them to take courses , that in no
way serve their interests. Such requirements are made using argu-
ments about breadth when they are there to make sure that undersub-
scribed courses get taught. Majors in computer science at Yale when I
arrived there had to take artificial intelligence and numerical analysis.
These subjects never interest the same people. They are as different as
accounting and clinical psychology. These requirements were there
because faculty wanted to make sure there were students enrolled in
their course. If they didn’t, they would have had to teach something
they didn’t know as well. Faculty made arguments about the well-
rounded student, but students’ needs had nothing to do with it.

Dershowitz wouldnt repeat what Trump told him privately but felt comfortable
recounting the parts of the their conversation that occurred in front of other dinner

guests.

Trump “clearly had subjects he wanted to talk about. It was his agenda,”
Dershowitz said. “He told me he thought in the Middle East, they are ready for a
deal.”

Trump explained that he’d spoken to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and

sensed that he was ready for a peace deal, Dershowitz said.

“T responded by saying, ‘the Palestinians say that to every new president,

Dershowitz said, offering Trump a dose of skepticism.

“He said ‘Now I think they’re really ready,’ ” Dershowitz added. “I said, “You have

to test them. ... You have to test them, it’s not enough to just hear ‘they’re ready.’
“He shook his head in apparent agreement,” Dershowitz said.

Dershowitz said Trump made it clear he was aware that the former professor is

“very friendly” with Netanyahu.

And the Israeli media is reporting that Dershowitz was tapped to be a back channel
sorts between Netanyahu and Trump. This chatter prompted some to wonder
whether Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who’d been tasked to be the point

person on a possible peace deal, was on the outs.

But Dershowitz said that’s not the case. “The president said, ‘I know you know

And Dershowitz added that he doesn’t have a role, formal or informal, in working

on behalf of the administration to jump start peace talks. “This was as a one off,”

he said.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018283.txt,"Terrorism, we have to understand, is merely one example of network danger and
power. So is China. And Russia. And these may not even be the most dangerous or
devastating network battles that will take place in our lives. It’s a commonplace to
say now that the international system is in the greatest period of upheval in more
than half a century. But often this sort of remark is accompanied by a list of moving
pieces that seem to be unconnected: China’s rise, the return of Russia, changes in the
Middle East, globalization and then reverse globalization. “Who would have thought
the post Cold War era, which was supposed to be characterized by ‘softpower’ and
economic interdependence would be so violent?”®* one team of scholars recently
wrote, reflecting the genuine wonderment of many “experts” who failed to predic
the end of the Cold War and then, largely, the nature of what has come after. Who
would have thought? Well, as we'll see, anyone who understands networks.

Thomas Hobbes - the 16 century British philosopher long considered an early
master of the analysis of cold, brutal power - once put it simply enough: Nations, he
said, need to be mastered. “During the time men live without a common power to
keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war,” he wrote. “Such
a war as is of every man against every man.”°’ A precondition of peace, for Hobbes,
was that some country or force or tribe decisively grips a region, an empire, even
the globe. “A common power to keep them all in awe,” fulfilled a need for order. In
our connected age, the common, awesome power is already here. It is networks. The
battle now is for and on of this genuinely historic, still curious force. They will be
attacked, throttled, trashed, accelerated, used, upgraded, won and lost and inflicted
on each of us and our security by those with a new sensibility. To feel the world with
a Seventh Sense will reveal a whole new landscape of power; it will permit us to see
the fibers of a new age and then weave them into how we see and think and, finally,
act. That essential, decisive terrain of our new age is, to the “Smart Power” and
“Don’t Come Home” crowd, still largely invisible and, anyhow, incomprehensible.

7.

Just as rivers or mountains or air currents drove commerce and combat in past eras,
networks will strongly, probably decisively, influence the dynamics ahead. Today
you can’t, after all, operate on the rivers or mountains or in the skies or space
without lively, near-instant connection. The space these interlocking networks
occupy represents a new geography. It is growing every day, as if it were a giant new
continent fusing together under the surface of the sea. We are, as the team at Gee!
Do! discovered, moving from a world in which nations battled nations to one in
which nations battle networks. And a world where networks battle networks. In
coming years, networks will surely break nations, as once nations broke each other.
It is linked the systems of trade and economics and biology and data that will create

Elsewhere in London: what’s on and what to see

Published: October 13 2010 01:20 | Last updated: October 13 2010 01:20

With the absence of Zoo, the Pavilion of Art & Design (PAD) (until October 17; www.padlondon.net) will this year
play second fiddle to Frieze. This sophisticated fair of modern and contemporary art, design, photography and
tribal art from 1860 was conceived by Patrick Perrin and Stéphane Custot and is now in its fourth year. PAD has
retained its place in Berkeley Square, a site that offers limited space expansion, but a sought-after Mayfair
address.

As auction houses all jostle to cash in on the festival spirit, Christie’s is launching an initiative entitled Multiplied
(October 15-18; www.multipliedartfair.com) at its South Kensington saleroom. The focus of this fair is
contemporary art editions — photographs, prints, artists’ books and 3D multiples — and there will be big names,
including John Baldessari, Mat Collishaw and Gerald Laing, on sale for small prices.

Another example of canny innovation — or outsiders crashing the party — is House of the Nobleman at 2 Cornwall

Terrace (October 15-20; www.cornwallterrace.co.uk/boswallhouse). This is a property viewing with a difference:
not only is the house itself on the market, but so is much of the art — including works by Pablo Picasso, Helen

Chadwick and Grayson Perry — that decorates its interior.

While the majority of Frieze Week events take place in grandiose settings in London’s West End, a couple of
contrasting fairs are capitalising on sites in the city’s East End. The Future Can Wait (until October 17;
www.thefuturecanwait.com), an alternative fair started by trusted talent-spotters Zavier Ellis and Simon Rumley,
returns to Shoreditch Town Hall for the fourth year running.

Extraordinary Assumptions and Hypothetical Conditions

The value conclusions are subject to the following extraordinary assumptions that may affect the assignment
results. An extraordinary assumption is uncertain information accepted as fact. If the assumption is found to
be false as of the effective date of the appraisal, we reserve the right to modify our value conclusions.

1. The subject property has a fueling dock and four fuel storage tanks located on site; including three diesel
and one gasoline. There were no signs of contamination during our inspection and we have assumed that
there is no adverse environmental impactin connection with the existing fuel equipment used on the
subject property.

2. The parking garage at the subject slightly encroaches on the neighboring property to the immediate
northwest. This land is owned by the Government of the Virgin Islands and we have assumed that no claim
will arise from the encroachments.

3. For this analysis, we have valued the going concern interest in the subject property and have allocated the
value of the personal property from the value of the real property. We were provided with financial
statments from ownership thatindicates the depreciated book value of these assets. It is beyond our scope
to value these assets in use; therefore, we have assumed that the book values of teh personal property
items shown in the statments provided by ownership are reasonably accurate for the purpose of this
allocation exercise.

The value conclusions are based on the following hypothetical conditions that may affect the assignment
results. Ahypothetical condition is a condition contrary to known fact on the effective date of the appraisal
but is supposed for the purpose of analysis.

1. No hypothetical conditions were employed in this analysis.

time-dependent neuronal characteristic of current interest involve neurons or
neuronal clusters that beat with almost strict periodicity, the oscillatory pacemakers.
For example, the program of research by Professor Al Selverson at University of
California at San Diego, among others, has elucidated the role of these rhythmic
pattern generators, both autonomous and those emerging from particular patterns
of network connections. A wide variety of functional links involving neuronal
pacemakers has been demonstrated. They range from the oscillatory transport of
calcium through membrane channels in neurons and heart muscle, smooth muscle
oscillations of the pylorus muscle of the stomach, the neuronal ganglion driven
chewing motions of the jaws of invertebrates and the retina-to-brain hypothalamic
cells gating human circadian rhythms coupling our body’s hormonal clocks to light

cycles.

Though regular rhythmicity in neuronal discharges is an intuitively attractive
idea and relatively easy to quantitate using simple sine wave trigonometric
transformations, in the real brain it is statistically rare. The commonest neuronal
discharge pattern observed is that of intermittent bursting, clusters of neuronal
discharges in time in which the inter-discharge intervals irregularly stretch and
contract like the bellow pleats of a syncopated accordion. Bursts of repeated firing
of some unpredictable length followed by silences of equally mysterious durations.
Their behavior can be represented as statistical measures using non-normal, /ong
tailed distributions and in-between entropies described previously. For a whole
human example, although the rhythm of manic depression is commonly thought to
involve periodic cycles, careful study using motility patterns of the timing through life
of these episodes of extreme mood states by Professor Allan Gottschalk at the
University of Pennsylvania and others have demonstrated an irregularly intermittent
bursting pattern in manic-depressive episodes, getting more frequent with age.
Neuronal inter-discharge intervals seldom demonstrate what is called a regression
to the mean like the normal distribution of heights, as one increases the number of
people measured, the tighter the distribution around the mean. Neurons, much like

our own irregular pattern of doing things (in spite of our plans), the statistical

CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
The Handler
As for his [Snowden’s] communication with the outside world, yes, I am his main contact

--Anatoly Kucherena, September 23, 2013

Time was rapidly running out for me in Moscow. On November 1*, I still had not been able
to make contact with Anatoly Kucherena, and my flight back to New York was in five days. My
fixer, Zamir, had been trying to arrange an appointment for three weeks but he had only received
one call back from Kucherena’s assistant, Valentina Vladimirovna Kvirvova. She wanted to know
how I knew Oliver Stone. He told her of my part in Stone’s movie Wall Street 2: Money Never
Sleeps. That was the last he had heard from her. Meanwhile a Moscow based journalist told me
that she had waited 18 months to hear back from him giving up. I also learned from a Russian
researcher that Kucherena had not given a single interview to any journalist since his television
interview with Sophie Shevardnadze on September 23, 2013. And no Russian journalist, or any
Moscow-based foreign journalist, had ever obtained an interview with Snowden. At this point,
Zamir was becoming increasingly doubtful about getting my access to either Kucherena or
Snowden.

But I had another contact in Moscow. When I had been investigating the 2006 Polonitum
poisoning of ex-KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London, I had interviewed a number of
people in Moscow, including Andrei Lugovoy. A former KGB officer assigned to protecting the
Kremlin’s top members in the 1990s, Lugovoy later opened his own security company. In 2005,
he became a business associate of Litvinenko’s in gathering information, and made regular trips to
London to meet with him. Since he had tea with Litvinenko at the Millennium hotel in London
on November 1, 2006, the day Litvinenko was poisoned, he became the main suspect in the
British investigation. He could not be extradited, however. After reconstructing the chronology
of the crime, I established that Litvinenko had been contaminated with Polonium at a Japanese
restaurant some four hours before his tea with Lugovoy. I therefore wrote that Lugovoy could
not have poisoned Litvinenko in the Millennium hotel, a finding that he said he greatly
appreciated.

Lugovoy was elected to the Duma in 2008, and also hosted a 24 part television series espionage
for which he was personally decorated by Putin. He was also now reputed to be in the inner circle
of power in Moscow. So I called him.

We arranged to meet in the lobby bar of the National Hotel. A short but well-built man with a
bullet-style haircut, Lugovoy showed up promptly at 1 PM. After discussing some of the
subsequent developments in the still-lingering Polonium investigation, I asked him if he knew
Kucherena.

at the scale of the total capital of the individual or any set of individuals. This fact

will prove helpful in adjusting the Ben-Porath model and in next generation theory.

It should be borne in mind that transfer out and transfer in are both implicitly
defined as net of plowback in the first place. Thus it would be wrong to suppose that
negative cash flow is transfer in less plowback from revenue. That mistake would

deduct plowback twice.

The Growth Truism

Growth of any asset of either factor is capitalization from outside plus capitalization

from inside less decapitalization. This difference can also be called net capitalization.

Capitalization from outside is simply transfer in t_ . What are the other two?

Our first intuition would be that capitalization from inside is identical to unrealized
output. Here we must be careful. Output is negative wherever the sum of growth
(net capitalization) and cash flow falls below zero. This “deadweight loss” is
implicitly uncovered decapitalization, meaning not recovered in cash flow. To
subtract all including unrecovered decapitalization from the sum of transfer in and

unrealized output would therefore subtract the unrecovered part twice.

To make this clear, define positive and negative output by
Y(>0)=max(Y,0) and Y(<0)=max(-Y,0)=2,

The sun comes up and dries up all the land. IAC chairmen and owner of The Newsweek/Daily Beast Barry
Diller and his designer wife Diane Von Furstenberg host their annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their
Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Governor Jerry Brown, just elected to his

tables covered with yellow flowers sit on oriental rugs, covering the soggy ground. Terrines of hot soup,

Geffen, casually chats with former Disney CEO Michael Eisner and current Sony chief Sir Howard Stringer.

background checks. The only thing they don’t do is pat me down and ask for fingerprints. Once inside the

Javier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best

acting methods are completely opposite. Josh says he is a quick study and is very creative and
comfortable ad-libbing. Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, needs to have every syllable printed out,
which he studies with a dialect coach. Little wiggle room for jokes. Life size photos on large cardboard
plaques are taped to each nominee’s chair. I try to memorize their location, so when I return Sunday I
can quickly kiss them all.

Several weeks prior to the scheduled showing, Gloria Steinem had written an article in Ms.
magazine about Deep Throat and the exploitation of its female lead, Linda Lovelace. Pointing to
the $60 million allegedly made on the film, Steinem characterized Deep Throat as “a national and
international profit center and dirty joke.” At the heart of the joke was Linda Lovelace “whose
innocent face offered movie-goers the titillating thought that even the girl-next-door might be the
object of porn-style sex.” But, according to Steinem, it was a joke with widely felt consequences:
“Literally millions seem to have been taken to Deep Throat by their boyfriends or husbands (not
to mention prostitutes by pimps) so that each one might learn what a woman could do to please a
man if she really wanted to.”

Moreover, Linda Lovelace was now claiming that her innocent face had been a mask covering up
a battered wife who had been imprisoned by her husband-pimp. Several years after the
completion of Deep Throat was completed, Lovelace wrote an autobiography entitled Ordeal, in
which she told a sordid story of how she had been compelled to perform her “sexual sword-
swallower trick” at gunpoint.

After reading Ordeal I called Reems and asked him whether his recollections of the filming of
Deep Throat corroborated her claim that she had been forced into performing. Harry, who was
then working off-Broadway in a stage play, laughed and said, “Are you kidding? Sure her
husband, Chuck, was an asshole, but he was hardly around during the filming. Damiano sent him
away because he would get jealous of how much she was enjoying the sex. She was really into it.
We had a good relationship before and during the filming.”

I told Harry that Lovelace had written that when “she saw how upset Chuck was, [she] decided
[she] would pretend to enjoy it with Harry.” I asked whether it was possible that she was only
acting.

“Linda Lovelace acting?” Harry exclaimed. “Have you seen her in a film? She couldn’t even
pretend to be acting.”

Whether true or false, Lovelace’s account struck a responsive chord among many feminists.
Gloria Steinem’s article presented a sympathetic portrait of Lovelace as the victim of everything
the “sleazy pornocrats” had come to represent. Using Lovelace’s Ordeal as a symbol of sexist
repression, many feminists declared all-out war against pornography. The movie Deep Throat
came to symbolize the anti-women evils of the sex industry. And I became the symbol of the
“pornocrat lawyer,” getting rich off the suffering of exploited women (even though I charged
nothing for these cases).

The organization through which Gloria Steinem spoke—Women Against
Pornography—advocated boycotts as its primary weapons in the war on porn. The boycotts were
directed not only against theaters and bookstores, but against lawyers who represented them on
First Amendment grounds. When I and several friends opened a Kosher deli in Harvard Square, it
was picketed with signs of saying “How can a porn pig serve Kosher food?”

Although boycotts are themselves protected by the constitutional right of free expression, civil
libertarians are appropriately concerned about the effect of overly broad boycotts, such as those

Another key offset to the lower corporate tax rate is the proposed ending of the
deduction of net interest expense. We assume that this rule would apply to new debt
and that existing debt would be grandfathered. This tax shield removal would increase
the cost of debt by an incremental 25% (not to mention the 100bp+ rise in long-term
interest rates seen since the summer of 2016). In the table below, we illustrate the
impact on S&P 500 corporate profits. We estimate that over time, the removal of the
interest rate deduction would detract about 4%, or $4-5 from S&P 500 2018 EPS,
although the initial impact would be less significant given 70-90% of the debt is long
term.

Many investors assume that interest deductions would likely apply only to new debt, and
if this were the case, the drag would be gradual for the overall S&P 500 as debt matures
and is refinanced. Companies have shifted the composition of their debt toward longer
maturities and fixed rates. We estimate an average S&P 500 debt maturity of over eight
years, with just one-third maturing within the next three years. The grandfathering of
existing debt is a reasonable assumption, but not a sure thing, in our view. There is a
possibility that legislators apply it to all debt on the grounds that most companies are
expected to be net beneficiaries of comprehensive tax reform.

There is also a possibility that this policy is phased in over a number of years, with
certain portions of the existing debt losing their interest deductibility over time.

The most negatively impacted companies would clearly be the ones with the most
leverage, in addition to those with depressed earnings (Metals & Mining, Energy, etc.).
While the Utilities sector has a lot of leverage, there would likely be a pass through to
customers in determining their allowed rate increase.

against you. As we've already discussed by email, I’d very much like to interview you about these allegations in
detail.

In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6
below). You claimed that “both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and
fabricated with malicious intent.” We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it.

The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. |
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia
Hughes.

Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below).
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western,
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints
and concerns about your behavior during this time.

Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues,
students, and peers in the skeptics movement.

| wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time.

Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish:

Incident 1:

° In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a
volunteer for CFI D.C.

° At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked
her if she was “of age.”

° Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner.

° You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying.

° You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work.

° In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne,
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner.

° You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face.

° You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights.

° She struggled to push you off her.

° You said, “When | was in college | could never get a girl that looked like you.”

° When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said “I have to go,” and rushed out of
the room.

the bell. But, as Mischel informed them, if they waited for his return, he would bring them more
marshmallows. Mischel took out his stopwatch and recorded how long each child waited before ringing
the bell.

Some children rang the bell almost immediately, leaving Mischel no time to leave the room.
Others waited. This isn’t surprising. Some children are impulsive, others are impatient, and this shows up
early in life. What is surprising is that these early appearing personality types held steadfast, impacting
later life decisions and actions. The more impatient types were more likely to be involved in juvenile
delinquency, have poor grades, abuse drugs, get divorced, and lose their jobs. For women who developed
eating disorders, those who were more patient were more likely to be anorexic, whereas those who were
more impulsive were more likely to be bulimic. When the American developmental psychologist B.J.
Casey put these now 40-somethings inside a brain scanner, the patient ones showed stronger activation in
the prefrontal areas of the brain when viewing happy and fearful faces, revealing stronger self-control
over their feelings. In contrast, when the impatient ones viewed the same stimuli, not only was there a
weaker response in the prefrontal region but a stronger response in the ventral striatum when viewing
happy faces. The striatum, as noted earlier, is involved in the experience of reward. For the impatient
types, seeing something positive is like eating candy, something that is hard to ignore. The patient types
regulate this feeling, transforming the heat of the moment into a cool experience. The impatient types are
overwhelmed by this feeling, giving into temptation. This work adds to the genetic evidence reviewed
earlier, showcasing both the importance of individual differences in self-control, and the stability of these
differences as distinctive personality types.

Individual differences in self-control are also relevant to levels of recidivism in youths who have
committed a crime, and thus tie us back to the beginning of this chapter and the costs of a career criminal.
Career criminals are individuals who repeatedly commit crimes. They lack self-control. This is important
for judges, juries and society as we want to know in advance who is most likely to commit another crime
if we release them back out onto the streets. The American sociologist Matt DeLisi presented a self-
control survey to approximately 800 juvenile youths, ages 12-17 years, each with a criminal record.
Those who scored one standard deviation from the mean on this survey, and thus were more impulsive
than most, were five times more likely to become career criminals. Five times. Self-control on its own
accounted for about 80% of the variation in recidivism among these delinquents; the remaining 20% was
accounted for by factors that one might think would be much more important, including mental health,
education, gender, and socioeconomic background. As DeLisi concludes, these results suggest that

measures of self-control provide a reliable predictor of the likelihood of repeating a crime. They provide a

VERY INTERESTING. G 
, Fred Simon 
The problems we face today are there because the people who 
work for a living are outnumbered by those who vote for a  
We Are Not Coming Back 
Please take a moment to digest this provocative article by a 
Jewish Rabbi from Teaneck, N.J. 
It is far and away the most succinct and thoughtful  
explanation of how our nation is changing. The article 
appeared in The Israel National News, and is directed to 
Jewish readership. 70% of American Jews vote as Democrats. 
The Rabbi has some interesting comments in that regard. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031699 
Rabbi Steven Pruzansky is the spiritual leader of 
Congregation Bnai Yeshurun in Teaneck, New Jersey 
The most charitable way of explaining the election results of 2012 is that Americans voted 
for the status quo - for the incumbent President and for a divided Congress. They must enjoy 
gridlock, partisanship, incompetence, economic stagnation and avoidance of responsibility. 
And fewer people voted. 
But as we awake from the nightmare, it is important to eschew the facile explanations for the 
Romney defeat that will prevail among the chattering classes. Romney did not lose because 
of the effects of Hurricane Sandy that devastated this area, nor did he lose because he ran a 
poor campaign, nor did he lose because the Republicans could have chosen better 
candidates, nor did he lose because Obama benefited from a slight uptick in the economy 
due to the business cycle. 
Romney lost because he didn't get enough votes to win. 
That might seem obvious, but not for the obvious reasons. Romney lost because the 
conservative virtues - the traditional American virtues — of liberty, hard work, free enterprise, 
private initiative and aspirations to moral greatness - no longer inspire or animate a majority 
of the electorate. 
The simplest reason why Romney lost was because it is impossible to compete against free 
stuff. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031700 
Every businessman knows this; that is why the loss leader or the giveaway is such a 
powerful marketing tool. Obama's America is one in which free stuff is given away: the adults 
among the 47,000,000 on food stamps clearly recognized for whom they should vote, and so 
they did, by the tens of millions; those who - courtesy of Obama - receive two full years of 
unemployment benefits (which, of course, both disincentivizes looking for work and also 
motivates people to work off the books while collecting their windfall) surely know for whom 
to vote. The lure of free stuff is irresistible. 
The defining moment of the whole campaign was the revelation of the secretly-recorded video 
in which Romney acknowledged the difficulty of winning an election in which 47% of the 
people start off against him because they pay no taxes and just receive money - free stuff - 
from the government. 
Almost half of the population has no skin in the game - they 
don't care about high taxes, promoting business, or creating 
jobs, nor do they care that the money for their free stuff is 
being borrowed from their children and from the Chinese. 
They just want the free stuff that comes their way at someone 
else's expense. In the end, that 47% leaves very little margin 
for error for any Republican, and does not bode well for the 
future. 
It is impossible to imagine a conservative candidate winning against such overwhelming 
odds. People do vote their pocketbooks. In essence, the people vote for a Congress who will 
not raise their taxes, and for a President who will give them free stuff, never mind who has to 
pay for it. 
That engenders the second reason why Romney lost: the inescapable conclusion that the 
electorate is ignorant and uninformed. Indeed, it does not pay to be an informed voter, 
because most other voters - the clear majority — are unintelligent and easily swayed by 
emotion and raw populism. That is the indelicate way of saying that too many people vote 
with their hearts and not their heads. That is why Obama did not have to produce a second 
term agenda, or even defend his first-term record. He needed only to portray Mitt Romney as 
a rapacious capitalist who throws elderly women over a cliff, when he is not just snatching 
away their cancer medication, while starving the poor and cutting taxes for the rich. 
During his 1956 presidential campaign, a woman called out to Adlai Stevenson: Senator, you 
have the vote of every thinking person! Stevenson called back: That's not enough, madam, 
we need a majority! 
Truer words were never spoken. 
Obama could get away with saying that Romney wants the rich to play by a different set of 
rules - without ever defining what those different rules were; with saying that the rich 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031701 
should pay their fair share - without ever defining what a fair share is; with saying that 
Romney wants the poor, elderly and sick to fend for themselves - without even 
acknowledging that all these government programs are going bankrupt, their current 
insolvency only papered over by deficit spending. 
Similarly, Obama (or his surrogates) could hint to blacks that a Romney victory would lead 
them back into chains and proclaim to women that their abortions and birth control would be 
taken away. He could appeal to Hispanics that Romney would have them all arrested and 
shipped to Mexico and unabashedly state that he will not enforce the current immigration 
laws. He could espouse the furtherance of the incestuous relationship between governments 
and unions - in which politicians ply the unions with public money, in exchange for which the 
unions provide the politicians with votes, in exchange for which the politicians provide more 
money and the unions provide more votes, etc., even though the money is gone. 
Obama also knows that the electorate has changed - 
America (they're already a minority in California) and that the new immigrants to the US are 
primarily from the Third World and do not share the traditional American values that attracted 
immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is a different world, and a different America. 
Obama is part of that different America, knows it, and knows how to tap into it. That is why 
he won. 
that whites will soon be a minority in 
Obama also proved again that negative advertising works, invective sells, and harsh personal 
attacks succeed. That Romney never engaged in such diatribes points to his essential 
goodness as a person; his negative ads were simple facts, never personal abuse - facts 
about high unemployment, lower take-home pay, a loss of American power and prestige 
abroad, a lack of leadership, etc. As a politician, though, Romney failed because he did not 
embrace the devil's bargain of making unsustainable promises. 
It turned out that it was not possible for Romney and Ryan - people of substance, depth and 
ideas - to compete with the shallow populism and platitudes of their opponents. Obama 
mastered the politics of envy — of class warfare - never reaching out to Americans as such 
but to individual groups, and cobbling together a winning majority from these minority 
groups. If an Obama could not be defeated - with his record and his vision of America, in 
which free stuff seduces voters - it is hard to envision any change in the future. 
The road to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and to a European-socialist 
economy - those very economies that are collapsing today in 
Europe - is paved. 
For Jews, mostly assimilated anyway and staunch Democrats, the results demonstrate again 
that liberalism is their Torah. Almost 70% voted for a 
president widely perceived by Israelis and most committed Jews as hostile to Israel . They 
voted to secure Obama's future at America 's expense and at Israel 's expense - in effect, 
preferring Obama to Netanyahu by a wide margin. 
A dangerous time is ahead. Under present circumstances, it is 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031702 
inconceivable that the US will take any aggressive action 
against Iran and will more likely thwart any Israeli initiative. 
The US will preach the importance of negotiations up until the 
production of the first Iranian nuclear weapon - and then state 
that the world must learn to live with this new reality. 
But this election should be a wake-up call to Jews. There is no permanent empire, nor is there 
an enduring haven for Jews anywhere in the exile. The American empire began to decline in 
2007, and the deterioration has been exacerbated in the last five years. This election only 
hastens that decline. 
Society is permeated with sloth, greed, envy and materialistic excess. It has lost its moorings 
and its moral foundations.. The takers outnumber the givers, and that will only increase in 
years to come. 
The Occupy riots across this country in the last two years 
were mere dress rehearsals for what lies ahead - years of 
unrest sparked by the increasing discontent of the 
unsuccessful who want to seize the fruits and the bounty of 
the successful, and do not appreciate the slow pace of 
redistribution. 
If this election proves one thing, it is that the Old America is gone And, sad for the world, it is 
not coming back. 
The problems we face today are there because the people who 
work for a living are outnumbered by those who vote for a  
living.

losing elections,” that is all BS. The elections we don’t win, we’re forcing those crony
capitalists to come and admit that they’re not going to do this again. The whole narrative
in Washington has been changed by this populist revolt that we call the grassroots of the
tea party movement.

And it’s specifically because those bailouts were completely and totally unfair. It didn’t
make those financial institutions any stronger, and it bailed out a bunch of people — by
the way, and these are people that have all gone to Yale, and Harvard, they went to the
finest institutions in the West. They should have known better.

And by the way: It’s all the institutions of the accounting firms, the law firms, the
investment banks, the consulting firms, the elite of the elite, the educated elite, they
understood what they were getting into, forcibly took all the benefits from it and then
look to the government, went hat in hand to the government to be bailed out. And they've
never been held accountable today. Trust me — they are going to be held accountable.
You're seeing this populist movement called the tea party in the United States.
Harnwell: Okay, I think we've got time for just one or two more questions for Stephen
K. Bannon, chairman of Breitbart Media, third-largest news organization in the States. I
know youw’re a very, very busy man, so we’re very grateful for the time that you've agreed

to put aside for this, to close this conference.

“T certainly think secularism has sapped the
strength of the Judeo-Christian West to defend
its ideals, right?”

Bannon: I’m never too busy to share with a group that can do as much good as you guys
can.

Questioner: What do you think is the major threat today, to the Judeo-Christian
Civilization? Secularism, or the Muslim world? In my humble opinion, they’re just trying
to defend themselves from our cultural invasion. Thank you.

According to one source, Mueller could hardly contain his disgust
when last month Rudy Giuliani, the President's new lawyer—hired to
make a case for the President on television and to push back against the
Mueller team—airily dismissed the notion that a sitting president can
be indicted. Adding insult to injury, Giuliani—who a White House source
said has likely learned of aspects of the pending indictment—said
Mueller agreed with that assessment. White House sources believe
Giuliani was daring the Special Counsel to tip his hand. But Mueller, ever
in character, contained his outrage and continued to hold his cards
close, as his team finished preparing the obstruction case and refined
the legal theories under which it would claim the right to haul the
president into court.

According to the proposed indictment, the President's scheme to
obstruct the FBI's investigation into connections between the Trump
campaign and Russian efforts to undermine the U.S. election began-on
the 7th day of the Trump administration. Three days prior, on January
24, National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, lied to the FBI about his
contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. These were
contacts, according to the indictment, directed by an unnamed but
ranking member of the Presidential Transition team. In the view of
several former DOJ lawyers who discussed the case with me, that
unnamed person-could be Trump himself-From January 27th, when the
President had the one-on-one dinner with FBI Director James Comey,
through to the middle of April, the President-conducted a cat and mouse
game with Comey, testing his loyalty and trying to establish his
willingness to aide the President and protect Flynn. On May 9th, baldly
admitting his dissatisfaction with Comey's unwillingness to play ball on
Russia, the President fired the FBI director. Shortly thereafter,
continuing his efforts to disrupt the investigation, the President turned
his ire on the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, pressuring him to fall into
line on the President's behalf, and on Robert Mueller, the newly
appointed Special Counsel, pushing to fire him to block the
investigation.

The second episode addressed in the indictment took place on
July 8, on Air Force one, where the President personally directed his
son, Don, Jr., to lie about the reason for his meeting in Trump Tower,
during the campaign, with representatives of the Russian government—
a meeting about collaborating with the Russians to undermine Hillary

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011678.txt,"One night’s massacre would have been enough to produce the outcry that
resulted once the first news reports, photos and TV pictures were sent around
the world. That the bloodletting was allowed to continue after we knew what
was going on, beyond the cost in innocent lives, made the fallout even worse. In
Israel, the response was unlike anything in the past. There had been some
opposition to the war: from parts of Labor, from political groups further to the
left and particularly the pressure group Peace Now, formed in 1978 to protest
the Begin government’s obvious desire to use the peace with Egypt as a means
to limit, rather than actively explore, prospects for a wider agreement with the
Palestinians.

After Sabra and Shatila, Peace Now was the driving force behind demands
for an inquiry into the Israeli role into what had happened. But the trauma went
deeper. Israelis of all political stripes jammed shoulder-to-shoulder into the
Kings of Israeli Square in the heart of Tel Aviv a week after the massacre.
There were soldiers, too: 20somethings back from the fighting and reservists a
decade or more older. Some estimates put the size of the crowd at as many as
400,000, almost ten percent of the population of Israel at the time. The protest
was nominally aimed at forcing the government to empower a commission of
inquiry, which it did a couple of days later. But the mood in the square was
more like an outpouring of shock and shame. While the catalyst was the
massacre in the camps, it tapped into a rumble of growing questions, and
doubts, about the war itself, which had been building ever since the prolonged
siege of west Beirut: what the invasion was for, how it had been planned and
prosecuted, and what it said about our country, our government and our armed
forces.

I was at home with Nava, watching the coverage of the demonstration on
television. I shared the protesters’ view that an inquiry was needed. In the days
since my phone call to Tsila Drori, ’'d remained troubled not just by our failure
to stop the killings once we knew what was going on, but by the response from
Begin, Arik and some other ministers to the massacre. Determined to shift the
blame and responsibility elsewhere, they kept driving home the point that it was
Phalangists, not Israelis, who had carried out the killings. That was true. But it
could not erase the failures of judgment and control on our part. We were the
ones who had allowed them into the camps. Our forces were deployed around
the perimeter. And the killers were our “Lebanese Christian allies”.

The formal picking-apart of Israel’s share of responsibility would be the job
of the inquiry commission. I did take some heart from the very fact such large

signed into law by President Obama. The
complex set of new measures targets key
industrial sectors, including shipping and
imports of products such as aluminum,
steel and coal, and seeks to block Iran
from using barter commodities such as
oil and gold to pay for imports. The
Washington Post paraphrased U.S.
officials as saying that, “the new policies
are closer to a true trade embargo,
designed to systematically attack and
undercut Iran’s major financial pillars
and threaten the country with economic
collapse.” Obama signed the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that
contained the sanctions provisions
despite having hinted earlier that he
might veto the NDAA over a host of
measures contained in the bill.

If the Obama administration believes that
ever-tougher sanctions will cause Iran to
cave in at the talks, it’s likely that they
are badly misreading Iranian politics.

For many observers, however, and for
Iran, too, the nomination of Hagel for
secretary of defense may be a sign that
the White House is beginning to realize
that sanctions, and threats of military
action, won’t force Iran’s hand.

As has been widely reported, hawks,
neoconservatives, and members of the
pro-Israel lobby in Washington have

descending into the realm of raucous indignity.

In April 2011, OCR published its first “Dear Colleague” letter with respect to responsibilities under Title
IX. In contrast to common (mis)understanding, the letter did not embody or reflect law. It was not law
in any sense of the word. It was not reporting on an act of Congress, nor was it setting forth an
administrative regulation enjoying the force of law. It was a letter — providing guidance, not the
direction that law enjoys. Nor did that guidance call for the appointment of a full-time Title IX
coordinator. To the contrary, that administrative step was more than three years away.

Three days after OCR’s “Dear Colleague” letter appeared, a public panel discussion took place on the
Baylor campus. In addition to myself, Vice President Jackson and Student Body President Wright
discussed a wide range of student-safety issues, and took questions from the floor. This on-campus
conversation was illustrative of what was underway around the nation. Everyone was aware of myriad
concerns about student safety, including freedom from interpersonal violence. No one had his or her
head in the sand, nor averted his or her gaze to avoid facing unpleasantness — or worse.

The work of the Campus Task Force was completed, and in the fall of 2012, a Campus Safety Committee
was formed. The Safety Committee pulled together stakeholders from all across campus to discuss any
and all threats to student safety. Issues relating to sexual assault were an integral part of the broad
mandate the Committee examined.

For its first three years, the Campus Safety Committee was chaired by Vice President Jackson. Its work
enjoyed the unalloyed support of the entire Executive Council. Then, in the following June (2013), |
personally issued a memorandum creating a specialized Task Force Review of Sexual Violence to conduct
a comprehensive review of Baylor’s policies and practices relating to sexual violence. This Task Force
(operating at the same time as the Campus Safety Committee) was formed in response to the
recommendations and concerns expressed by John Whelan, then the head of Human Resources.

Action items quickly emerged. The entering freshman class that fall (August 2013) were specifically
briefed by a senior Student Life staff member on what was expected in terms of proper, upright
behavior. Entering students were provided with a copy of OCR’s “Know Your Rights” summary, along
with a highly-specific cover letter from Vice President Jackson. The following month (September 2013)
the “Do Something!” campaign was launched — a sexual assault prevention campaign hosted the week
after Labor Day 2013. The campaign was sponsored by Baylor’s Sexual Assault Advisory Board, chaired
by Dr. Cheryl Wooten, an outstanding leader recognized across the nation for her expertise in dealing
with the horror and trauma of sexual violence.

A myth quickly arose that the women in the administration—Clinton,
U.N. ambassador Susan Rice, and national-security aide Samantha
Power, whose Pulitzer Prize—winning book on genocide was
influential in Obama’s thinking—drove the debate. “The idea that the
girls pushed the boys into war is ludicrous,” says Anne-Marie
Slaughter, who until recently served as director of policy planning at
State. “We were dismissed for months as soft liberals concerned
about ‘peripheral’ development issues like women and girls, and now
we're Amazonian Valkyrie warmongers. Please.” In truth, the
president, as usual, was not persuaded by anyone to change his mind.
He was always a reluctant warrior and decided to intervene only
when imminent atrocities in Benghazi made sitting on his hands even
riskier.

What the women policymakers did do was help mobilize the alliance.
Rice worked hard for the broadest possible language in U.N.
Resolution 1973, to allow maximum allied flexibility, while Hillary
made sure that China and Russia abstained instead of vetoing the
resolution.

Hillary already spends much of her life on her plane, but for six
crucial days in March she might just as well have used her seat belt as
a fashion accessory, flying nearly 20,000 miles on the Washington-
Paris-Cairo-Tunis-Washington-Paris-Washington route. On March
14 and 15, she met with Nicolas Sarkozy. The French president was
gung-ho to attack Qaddafi, who by then was reversing rebel advances
and regaining the offensive. After taking the measure of Mahmoud
Jibril, recognized as one of the leaders of Libya’s transitional
government, Hillary agreed to U.S. intervention if the U.N. backed it.
Viewing television images of the dictator’s brutality from her
quarters at the U.S. ambassador’s residence strengthened her resolve.
She took to seconding her husband’s much-repeated line that the

for the fall of the regime. The president is now fighting for his
political life and for that of the regime put in place in 1970 by his
father, the late President Hafez al-Assad.

Forty-one years in power

The rule of the Assads, father and son, has now lasted 41 years, a
score comparable to that of other long-lasting Arab autocrats, each
apparently determined to be a président-a-vie. In no other part of the
world have so many rulers clung so assiduously to power. Bashar
appears genuinely to have believed that the Arab nationalist ideology
he inherited, his opposition to Israel and his support for resistance
movements such as Hizbullah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, gave
him immunity from popular discontent. In an interview with The
Wall Street Journal on 31 January, he claimed that Syria could not be
compared to Egypt. “Why is Syria stable,” he asked, “although we
have more difficult conditions? Egypt has been supported financially
by the United States, while we are under embargo by most countries
of the world. We have growth although we do not have many of the
basic needs for the people. Despite all that, the people do not go into
an uprising. So it is not only about needs and not only about reform.
It is about the ideology, the beliefs and the cause that you have. There
is a difference between having a cause and having a vacuum.”
Unfortunately for Bashar, this analysis has proved wrong. As if
caught unawares, his first public speech on 30 March was a public
relations disaster. It was delivered to an obedient parliament, which
interrupted him repeatedly with acclamation and crass plaudits. In an
aside, he seemed to concede that external crises had distracted him
from making the reforms he had intended when he first took office. In
a second speech on 16 April to his newly appointed cabinet, he
announced the lifting of the hated state of emergency, in force since
the Ba’ath Party seized power in 1963, and the abolishing of the
dreaded Special State Security Court. But even these moves came to

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030274.txt,"Netanyahu originally planned to come to Washington with a
generous peace proposal to entice the Palestinians back to the
negotiating table. But Obama painted him into a corner and made him
change his script by notifying him, as he was about to board his
plane, that the President was going to call for Israel to return to its
1949-1967 lines, without also calling for the Palestinians to give up
their right of return. By thus preempting the prime minister, he forced
him to become more defensive of Israel's bargaining positions and
less willing to offer specific, generous concessions. The result was a
powerful speech in defense of Israel by Netanyahu, an
overwhelmingly positive response from Congress and a movement
away from peace negotiations.

All in all, the President's well-intentioned efforts to jump-start the
peace process have backfired, not so much because he favors one side
over the other, but because of the ham-handedness of his negotiation
strategy. A negotiator or mediator whose statements move the parties
further away from the negotiating table than they were before he
spoke deserves a failing grade in the science of negotiation.

What the President should have done is to insist that both parties
immediately agree to sit down and negotiate without any
preconditions.

It's not too late. But it will take yet another explanation of what
President Obama really meant in his ill-advised speech.

Dershowitz's most recent novel is The Trials of Zion.

		Code Enforcement Officer Gerry presented the facts of the case and said the Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and payment of the fire inspection fee in addition to any late penalties by July 21, 2008.  Mr. Hoffman inquired about the late penalties and Mr. Gerry said they were based on a monthly penalty of 10% per month.  In response to Mr. Ochstein’s question, Mr. Gerry explained that both the business and the property owner were cited.  Mr. Fried inquired about service and Mr. Gerry said it was sent by certified mail.  Mr. Ballentine asked if any attempts, other than by mail, were made to get in touch with someone at the business.  Mr. Gerry said he went to the business, was told the owner was difficult to reach and left his business card but had not received any response.

		Violation of Chapter 46, Section 46-68 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, annual fire and life safety inspection fees not paid 



		Code Enforcement Officer Gerry presented the facts of the case and recommended a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and payment of the fire inspection fee in addition to any late penalties by July 21, 2008.  Mr. Gerry said he also tried, with negative results, to make contact with the owner of this business as it is the same owner as the other case at this location. Mr. Ochstein remarked that this was the same business which had been before the Board previously and had even “bounced a check” to the Town and wanted to know if there was something more that could be done other than the standard $150.00 costs.  Mr. Gerry said he could review the case further to see if it could be brought back for additional fines. Mr. Hoffman asked if these cases were brought to Code Enforcement by the Finance Department and Mr. Gerry said they came from the Fire Prevention Bureau who handles their own billing and explained the procedure for that.  Mr. Hoffman said it seemed like a year was a long time for these cases to be in arrears.  Mr. Gerry said the cases were coming over quicker now from Fire Prevention and he thought it would improve in the future.

		Violation of Chapter 46, Section 46-68 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, annual fire and life safety inspection fees not paid 



		Code Enforcement Officer Gerry presented the facts of the case and said he had spoken with Robin Gert who advised him the bill had been mishandled and gotten lost in their system.  He said he spoke to her yesterday and was told the payment was still in process.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and payment of the fine inspection fee in addition to all late penalties and costs by August 4, 2008.



		MOTION MADE BY MS. GREENBERG TO FIND THE VIOLATOR IN NON-COMPLIANCE, ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $150.00 AND ORDER THEM TO PAY THE FIRE INSPECTION FEE IN ADDITION TO ANY LATE PENALTIES BY AUGUST 4, 2008.

	G.	Case # 08-2516, 313 ½ Worth Ave., # B2, David Clark

          Violation of Chapter 114, Section 114-32 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, business tax receipt required

          

          Code Enforcement Officer Gerry presented the facts of the case and said Mr. Clark had submitted his paperwork and paid the fee but there was a zoning issue still in question.  The Zoning Administrator is out of the office this week on jury duty and based on the inability to get the issue resolved, the Town recommends the case be postponed until the August 21, 2008 hearing date.

          

          Mr. Fried questioned what the zoning issue had to do with a business tax receipt and Mr. Gerry said the Town records do not show this particular suite existing at this address but Mr. Clark has documents showing it there.

		

          

	

	

          Mr. Gerry said zoning is tied into business tax receipts because zoning requirements do not allow certain businesses in some districts.  There is also the question of whether the space is legitimate because people will subdivide suites and make two spaces where there should only be one.  Mr. Gerry said it looked like a legal space from the documentation Mr. Clark provided but the Zoning Administrator needed to approve it.

		MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY 

          

	H.	Case # 08-2517, 2270 E. Ibis Isle Road, Mark Remson Trust

		REPEAT Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, Environment, properties to be maintained in a good condition.



		Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said the violation was discovered from routine patrol in the area but shortly after the notice of repeat violation was sent out, a citizen complaint was received as well.  Mr. Weymer said there had been at least seven previous letters to this property owner regarding lack of maintenance on the property. A repeat notice of code violation was mailed out on June 24, 2008 with a mandatory hearing date.  The lot was cut on or around July 2, 2008.  This particular violation is a Class II violation under the fine schedule which calls for a fine of $400.00, however, by law, the Board has the ability to impose a fine of up to $500.00 because it is a repeat violation.  Mr. Weymer said he believes it is important to look at the track record of this property in considering the fine.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and a fine of $500.00, which is the maximum fine for a repeat violation.



		Mr. Hoffman said it seemed that every time the property owner gets notified he comes into compliance but he has to be notified.  Mr. Weymer says there are times when he comes into compliance but on at least two other occasions, he has been before the Board because he has not complied by the time set.  Mr. Ochstein asked if he has been fined in the past and Mr. Weymer said there are two outstanding fines for which liens have been placed on the property.

	I.	Case # 08-2518, 230 Esplanade Way, Kenneth J. Horton

          	Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86 (19) of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, cleared land must be re-sodded or replanted to prevent the creation of windblown dust or dirt and Chapter 42, Section 42-86, unsightly, unsafe or unsanitary conditions not permitted and properties to be maintained in good condition.

          

          Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said the violation was discovered on routine patrol.  Mr. Weymer has been in contact with a property representative, Louis Pascerelli who said Mr. Horton had not been in Town to receive his mail. Mr. Weymer said Mr. Pascerelli had proposals from Hansen Landscape for the clean up and re-sod of the lot and a weekly maintenance contract to assure this does not happen again.  Tropical Irrigation has also been contacted to put in a new irrigation system.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and the property owner be given until August 18, 2008 to come into compliance. Mr. Fried said he believed a fine of some sort should be imposed.  Mr. Ballentine asked how long Mr. Horton had been out of compliance.  Mr. Weymer said the original warning was sent on June 5, 2008 and a notice of violation and hearing was sent on June 20, 2008.  Mr. Weymer said the first contact with the property owner was July 7, 2008.  Mr. Ballentine asked if the August compliance date was reasonable and Mr. Weymer said Jim Hansen of Hansen Landscape thought the work would be done before that date but wanted more time in case he ran into any problems.

	J.	Case # 08-2519, 206 Dunbar Road, AMF Estate Management

          	Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-230 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, leaf blower over 65dBA at 50 ft.

          

          Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said he witnessed the violation on June 26, 2008.  AMF had previously been warned on February 19, 2008 for using a leaf blower over 65dBA.  Mr. Weymer performed a decibel test for this violation and the reading was 79.6 dBA at 50 feet. This is a class II violation under the fine schedule which has a $125.00 fine for the first offense.  The violation was issued on site to a superintendant for AMF and has not been paid.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and payment of the $125.00 fine.

          

          Mr. Hoffman asked whether this company had participated in the leaf blower testing being offered by Code Enforcement.  Mr. Weymer said AMF had participated in the testing program and had several leaf blowers certified.  He said the truck he was out with had 2 other leaf blowers on the truck that he could identify as being over 65dBA but he only tested the one they were using and wrote a violation for that one.  Ms. Van Buren asked about the testing method and Mr. Weymer explained how it was done.

	K.	Case # 08-2520, 165 Brazilian Ave., Richard Lynn

          Violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, if any dog attacks and causes severe injury or death to any human or domestic animal more than once, the owner shall be required to have said dog removed from the Town or humanely euthanized at his/her sole expense and violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-6 of the Code which prohibits animals from creating nuisances which are detrimental to the public safety and welfare.

          

          (Mr. Ochstein recused himself, stating that he has a relative who has a business relationship with Dr. Lynn and Mr. Hoffman advised Mr. Vanneck would be a voting member in this case) 

          

          	Sgt. Curtis Krauel said this case was brought to Code Enforcement through a culmination of events spanning back over a period of 4 years.  Sgt. Krauel explained Section 10-6 of the Code and said he was going to be showing some graphic photographs.  Sgt. Krauel presented the facts of each of the documented cases involving attacks by Duke from March 17, 2004 until May 11, 2008.

          

          Mr. Hoffman questioned how the Code Enforcement Board came into this procedure since the Town Council had already said Duke is a dangerous dog. Mr. Randolph explained that Town Council does not have the authority to fine.  Originally, the police department did not issue a code enforcement board citation but ordered the dog be removed from the Town or humanely euthanized which was appealed to Town Council.  Town Council denied the appeal. Since that time, Dr. Lynn has refused to comply with the order of the Town Council so a citation was issued by Code Enforcement to bring the matter before the Board to determine whether there should be a finding of violation and at a later time, whether a fine should be imposed. Mr. Randolph said it was now the jurisdiction of the Code Enforcement Board and not the Town Council.  Mr. Hoffman questioned whether or not the Board had to determine if the dog was going to be euthanized or removed from the Town and Mr. Randolph explained that this was not the Board’s determination.  The Board was only to determine whether or not there had been a violation of the Town Code.  



		Sgt. Krauel continued his presentation remarking that once Duke had been found “potentially dangerous” by Animal Care and Control, there had been another attack but due to an administrative error by Animal Care and Control in failing to document their records appropriately, Duke was classified as “potentially dangerous” again.  This is an error that Animal Care and Control completely acknowledges. 



		After the last attack on May 11, 2008, Duke was taken into custody by Animal Care and Control and after a hearing, was classified as “dangerous”.  Sgt. Krauel noted that the hearing before Special Magistrate Earl Mallory did not classify Duke as vicious because Duke had no documented cases of attacks on humans.  After this last case was reviewed by Code Enforcement, sufficient evidence was also found by the Town to classify Duke as dangerous and Dr. Lynn was notified by registered mail.  Dr. Lynn appealed to Town Council and that appeal was denied by Town Council by a 5-0 vote.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance with Chapter 10, Section 10-6 as the Town has the two required affidavits of residents of the Town occupying separate households.  The Board was provided with copies of four (4) affidavits.  



		Sgt. Krauel then proceeded with an explanation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 and said the Town was requesting a separate motion for a finding of non-compliance of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) and that Dr. Lynn be given until July 18, 2008 to come into compliance by either removing the dog from the Town or having it humanely euthanized.  If compliance is not achieved, the Town recommends a daily fine of $250.00 a day commence on July 19, 2008 and continue until compliance is achieved.  



		Mr. Randolph requested the Board treat these two sections of the Code separate and apart.  He said the first evidence heard related to Section 10-6 (3) and involved the affidavits from the residents of the Town.  Because of the dispute Dr. Lynn’s attorney has with regard to the manner that Section 10-45 was applied, Mr. Randolph recommended the two Code sections not be mixed up.  Mr. Randolph said he would like for the Board to first consider whether there had been a violation of 10-6 and to make a motion one way or the other with regard to the Staff’s recommendation.  He then requested that Section 10-45 be entertained separately after Dr. Lynn’s attorney and anyone else who wanted to speak had an opportunity to do so.  



		Vivian Dorris, 155 Brazilian Ave., said her beagle/bassett, Charlie, was viciously attacked by Dr. Lynn’s dog, Duke and she has sustained approximately $8500 in vet’s bills.  She said her dog will never walk properly again because of severe nerve damage.  She does not feel there are enough precautions being taken for the safety of residents on Brazilian Ave.  She asked that the Board take this into consideration and thanked them for their service.



		Wayne Gerl, 149 Brazilian Ave., said he has two dogs and every time he exits his driveway or front yard, he has to stop and peek around and make sure the other dogs are not in the area.  He said he was bitten by Duke a couple of years ago.  He was talking with Dr. Lynn and the dog just reached out and bit him, tearing his pants and breaking the skin.  He said he has been friends with Dr. Lynn and Margrit for many years but it was just unsafe for anybody and any animals in the area. 



		Bobby Goodnough said he was jogging in the area and the dog lunged at him, causing him to have to dive through a 12 foot hedge to get away from it.   He said he just thought it was a matter of time before the dog got a person or a child. Sgt. Krauel asked if Mr. Goodnough had reported the incident to the police department or had a time frame of occurrence.  Mr. Goodnough said he had not made a police report but it occurred about 2 years ago. 



		Laura Klein, 130 Seaspray Ave., said she had lived here for 12 years, having moved from Washington, D.C. for a sense of security.  She said she was now in the process of installing surveillance cameras.  She said she could no longer walk her dog without constantly looking around, worrying if Duke had once again escaped from the open gates.  She said it is a privilege to own a dog and dog ownership and responsibility should go hand in hand.  She said Dr. Lynn was issued a citation in August of 2002 for locking his dog in a car with the windows rolled up. She said she mentioned this to prove his irresponsibility.  She said his voluminous file from Animal Care and Control would attest to this.   She said no one was safe while Duke is in Palm Beach.  



		James Merola was present on behalf of Dr. Lynn and said he was present on a revised Notice of Code Violation and Hearing dated July 15, 2008.  He said he was not denying there were incidents with Duke.  Palm Beach County had the dog taken into custody and the hearing was held June 5, 2008.  At that hearing, it was agreed upon by the County and Dr. Lynn that the dog would be classified as dangerous.  The dog was classified as dangerous which required certain restrictions on the dog which Dr. Lynn complied with and the dog was returned to him.  In the event Duke has another incident, pursuant to state and county law, but some reason not Town law, the dog would be taken into custody and euthanized.  Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn feels very badly about the situation and agreed with the County to do what they required.   Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn then received a letter, dated June 16, 2008 from the police department, mentioning the order of the County and stating for the first time that the Town was declaring the dog dangerous and giving him ten (10) days to appeal, which he did not. On June 20, 2008, 4 days after the dog was declared dangerous by the Town, the police department sent a second letter, citing 10-45 (i), advising that since the dog already had two incidents, they wanted it removed or euthanized.  The dog had not done anything since being declared dangerous.  This letter did not mention an appeal, but he sent a letter anyway, stating they did not agree with that.  He said the dog was declared dangerous on June 16th, requirements were imposed and they complied with those, including the filing of a $1000 bond and they did not agree the dog should now be removed.  There was a Town Council hearing on August 8th and the Council said they needed to have the dog removed or euthanized.  Mr. Merola went into detail about the requirements of 10-45 and said Dr. Lynn had complied with all of those.  Then the letter of June 20th came, requiring Dr. Lynn to remove the dog or euthanize it.  Mr. Merola read subsection (h) into the record and said the Code Enforcement Board did not have any jurisdiction over subsection (i) as subsection (h) just mentioned (d) through (g).  The Town filed a lawsuit and he and Mr. Randolph were before Judge Hoy this morning.  The Town is asking to have the dog removed or euthanized and asking for a permanent injunction, stating an emergency situation.  Judge Hoy gave them a hearing at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday where it will be determined whether the dog is a nuisance, whether 10-45 (i) even applies to the situation and if the Board has authority over 10-45 (i).  If the Judge says the dog has to go, they are not going to argue with the Court but he believes they have a right to present their case.  He does not believe the Town’s position that the fine should start tomorrow is correct.  He believes the Board can only find violations of subsections (d) through (g) of 10-45.  There have been no allegations that Dr. Lynn has violated subsections (d) through (g).  Mr. Merola believes it is clear that the Code Enforcement Board has no authority under (i). Mr. Merola then addressed 10-6 and said he believed that since all precautions have been taken under 10-45, the dog does not constitute a nuisance.  Mr. Merola said he has an injunction relief request before the Judge to stop the Board from making this decision.  Mr. Merola said Mr. Randolph has asked them to determine these two (2) ordinances separately and he does not believe 10-45 (i) is in the Board’s purview, and as to the nuisance, the dog has to be a nuisance now and it is not.  This is all going to be determined Tuesday and he is asking the Board to either deny the Town’s recommendation because the Town cannot prove the dog is a nuisance now or reset this case until next month’s hearing.  



		Sgt. Krauel advised he wanted to make a rebuttal to some of Mr. Merola’s comments. The service of notice Mr. Merola referred to in declaring the dog dangerous was when the police department spoke with Dr. Lynn on June 12, 2008 and was told Duke was being housed at a kennel in Palm Beach County.  A notice could not be served to Dr. Lynn to have him come into compliance with something he was already in compliance with.  The dog was not in the Town.  The police department did not find out the dog was in Town until June 20th when Laura Klein reported the dog attempted to break free of Dr. Lynn to attack her and this is when the letter was sent out requesting compliance with Section 10-45.  Dr. Lynn was given the entire ordinance on June 10th, not just sections or specific acts that he needed to comply with.  Duke was not on the property at that time and no notification to remove the dog from the property could be served then because the dog was not there.  As far as the police department was concerned, Dr. Lynn was in compliance with the ordinance.  Sgt. Krauel pointed out that the Town does not abide by the state and the county ordinances, that the Town has the ability to enforce more stringent and strict ordinances and that is what we have done here.  



		Sgt. Krauel said he was prepared, based on Counsel’s recommendation, to recommend a motion to find Dr. Lynn in non-compliance with Section 10-6 and move to postpone 10-45 (i) until after further consideration by the Circuit Court on Tuesday.  The Town recommends administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and a fine of $250.00 a day to start on June 19, 2008 if compliance is not achieved by June 18, 2008.  



		Mr. Ballentine asked for clarification on the motion and was advised by Mr. Randolph that it would be a finding of non-compliance of Chapter 10, Section 10-6, administrative costs of $150.00 and a compliance date of July 18, 2008 with a fine to be considered at the next meeting if compliance was not achieved.



		Ms. Duemler said she believed that the dog, besides being a nuisance, is a threat to society and she hoped that by Tuesday the dog did not break loose from Dr. Lynn and maul some child, that she believed it is a disgrace and she supports the Town.



		(applause from the audience)



		MOTION BY MR. FRIED TO FIND DR. LYNN IN VIOLATION OF CHAPTER 10, SECTION 10-6,  ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $150.00 AND REQUIRE HIM TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE BY JULY 18, 2008

		MOTION SECONDED BY MR. BALLENTINE

		MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY



		

		Mr. Randolph asked if a motion could be made to defer the consideration of violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) until the August 21, 2008 meeting and Ms. Greenberg advised she would make that motion.  Mr. Fried asked Mr. Randolph if he would explain the reason for this.  Mr. Randolph said the argument had been made that 10-45 should not apply because the dog has already been deemed dangerous by the County and pursuant to the Town’s Code.  Mr. Randolph said he believed the argument was going to be made in court on Tuesday that it is not appropriate for the Town to move forward with regard to 10-45 (i) because that only applies to any incident that occurs after the dog has been declared dangerous.  The argument has been made that Dr. Lynn has done everything he is required to do.  Mr. Randolph said he hesitated to explain further if the matter was going to be deferred.  Mr. Randolph said the position of Staff is that item (i) stands on its own merits, that it is not connected to 10-45 (a) through (h).  It is also the position of Staff that it is appropriate to bring a violation of (i) to the Code Enforcement Board even though it does not specifically state that in 10-45 because Section 2-439, which is the citation fine schedule, sets forth all of the sections of the Code of Ordinances which can be brought before the Code Enforcement Board and 10-45 is listed.  Code Enforcement has the right to bring a violation directly to the Code Enforcement Board instead of issuing the fine set forth in the fine schedule. Mr. Randolph said the Board could move forward in considering 10-45 instead of deferring it to the next meeting. 



		Mr. Fried commented that based on the egregious nature of what they had been presented with, he believed the Board should do everything they could to put pressure on Dr. Lynn to comply.  Mr. Randolph questioned whether the Town would be requesting a separate fine of $250.00 a day for non-compliance and Sgt. Krauel said that was his recommendation, that there would be two concurrent fines running.  Mr. Hoffman asked about the administrative costs and Sgt. Krauel said the Town was only asking for one.

		SECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG

		MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY



		Mr. Merola questioned what the order was with regard to 10-6, if it was to have the dog removed or euthanized by Friday or just to abate the nuisance.  He said he needed to know what to tell Dr. Lynn what had to be done by Friday to avoid the potential fine.  Mr. Hoffman said Dr. Lynn needed to either remove the dog or have it euthanized and Mr. Fried said that was his intention in making the motion. 









VI.	Old Business:



	A.	Case # 08-2484, 515 N. County Road, Trump Properties, LLC	

		Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-205 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, the Architectural Commission may attach conditions to any approval it grants.



		Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton advised this case would be heard at Town Council on August 11, 2008 and requested the case be postponed until the August 21, 2008 hearing date.  Mr. Trump’s attorney and the attorney for the new purchaser were both present.  



		Robert Brody said he was the attorney for County Road Property LLC, who had just purchased the property two days ago.  He said it was the intent of his client to comply with the Town and also to work with the Town.  There is an appeal pending and Mr. Brody said it was his client’s intent to work everything out with ARCOM prior to that appeal. He said he had recommended to his client that he withdraw the appeal. Mr. Brody said his client had hired the Lawrence Group and Gene Lawrence planned to work with ARCOM.

VII.	Fine Consideration:	

	

	

	A.	Case # 08-2432, Beachfront Vista Property, Nightingale Beach Club Association

		Violation of Chapter 134, Section 134-1472 (3) of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, no additional walls, fences, hedges or other structures or growth shall be erected or be grown eastwardly of Ocean Boulevard to a height greater than four (4) feet above the surface of the Ocean Boulevard.



          (Ms. Duemler recused herself as part of a previously declared conflict and Mr. Hoffman advised Mr. Vanneck would be a voting member in this case) 



          Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said Nightingale Beach Club had previously been found in violation and was given time to obtain a permit.  A permit was obtained but there were some conditions attached to it.  There have been two inspections with the Florida Wildlife Commission and an agreement was reached to not require the vegetation to be trimmed until after turtle season.  Since they have already been found in non-compliance, the Town recommends the time for compliance be extended to November 7, 2008 and if compliance is not achieved by that date, a fine of $250.00 a day be imposed.  

          

          Jack Maxey, 244 Nightingale Trail, presented some documents to the Board and advised he was president of the Nightingale Trail Beach Club Association.  He said one of the documents was his application under duress for the permit.  Mr. Maxey advised he had not been sworn in and was administered the oath of office by Recording Secretary Houston.  

          

          Mr. Maxey said he has had a long correspondence with the legal department of the Department of Environmental Protection and he believes on an emotional level, they do not believe the trees should come down but they told him they could not find any statutory way to force the Town not to enforce the permit.  They told him it should be the jurisdiction of a court, not the DEP. Mr. Maxey said the Town was cutting down its own sea grapes in violation of the permitting process. Mr. Maxey said there were all kinds of burdens in this permit he needed to comply with, one of which was replacement of the whole plant if anything over 6 feet tall which was larger than 3 inches in diameter was cut down.  He said he was supposed to provide a signature on the document putting himself at risk of a $10,000 a day fine if he did not comply with the requirements of the permit. Mr. Maxey said Jean Higgins, a biologist for the State Fish & Wildlife, recommended sea grapes should not be trimmed because they are the best source of protection against the lighting.  Ms. Higgins made some suggestions such as changing light fixtures and extinguishing lights during turtle season and maintaining a substantial healthy vegetation light blocking buffer.  

          

          Mr. Maxey said an approximate 24 inch piece of aluminum is hanging from the light on Nightingale Trail and it seemed highly unusual that a shield of that nature would only be necessary on that light when the recommendations given by Fish & Wildlife are recommendations with broad reaching impact for the entire island.  He noted that the street lights in Palm Beach do not go off during turtle nesting season.  He said a field permit for trimming of the sea grapes at the Nightingale Beach Club Association was not recommended during the nesting season.  He said the indifference to materials he had brought forth more than a year ago that had now been brought forth officially by the DEP were offensive to him and that is one of the reasons he had continued to “hammer” this.   He said he believed the Board should recommend to the Town Council that they remove this section of the Code, given the current environmental regime, especially when one considers the public relations downside of fighting him on this issue and spending $2,000,000 to fight Lake Worth on the other side.  Mr. Maxey said this was probably not a win-win situation and that NOAA had not even been brought into the fold yet.  

          

          Mr. Ochstein wanted to know if the Board was precluded from enforcing the ordinance now.  Mr. Walton said it should not be enforced now, that in speaking with Mr. Wettstein from DEP and Ms. Higgins from FWC, an agreement had been reached to wait until the end of turtle season to require the trimming.  The Town recommends granting the Nightingale Beach Club until November 7, 2008 to come into compliance.  The permit is good until that date. In response to Mr. Hoffman’s question, Mr. Walton said the permit was issued on June 16, 2008.  Mr. Maxey said he applied on March 19, 2008.  Mr. Balletine inquired as to whether 7 days was sufficient for compliance after the end of turtle season and Mr. Walton said it was not a large area and he believed it was. Mr. Maxey said he did not believe it was sufficient, that it would be an economic hardship if he had to replace every tree that is over 3 inches in diameter in order to get it below 6 feet and he brought up other issues involved with the trimming.  Mr. Balletine told Mr. Maxey he just wanted to know, without going into a lot of detail, whether he could comply in a 7 day period..  Mr. Maxey said that before he could remove any native plant, he had to first remove every single non-native one from the property and he had some questions whether or not he could comply within that time period.  He also said he had some real questions about whether the law, both at the State and the local level, had been equally applied within the Town. Mr. Maxey said he is in consultation with an attorney to find out what measures he can take.  The Town did not apply for a permit to cut its own sea grapes and judging from the guidelines he has in his permit, the Town would be in violation of almost everyone of those guidelines.  The DEP counsel’s office asked him to provide photographs of the Town’s illegal cutting back in February.  

          

          Mr. Vanneck said there should be more research as to what should and should not be cut.  He believes the Town code may have gone too far.  

          

          Mr. Hoffman said the Board did not have the authority to modify the Code and could only enforce the Codes as they had been written.

          

          MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT THE VIOLATOR UNTIL NOVEMBER 7, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND IF COMPLIANCE IS NOT ACHIEVED BY THAT DATE, TO ASSESS A FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF $250.00 A DAY UNTIL COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED

          SECONDED BY MR. BALLENTINE

          

          Mr. Vanneck asked for clarification on what the motion was and Mr. Walton advised the motion was that the sea grapes must be cut after turtle season, by November 7, 2008 and if they were not cut by that date, a $250.00 a day fine would commence on November 8, 2008 and continue until compliance was achieved.

          

          Mr. Fried asked who the fine would apply to and Mr. Walton said it would be to the Nightingale Trail Beach Club Association.  Mr. Fried asked if this was a legally constituted body and Mr. Maxey said it was an informal body, that on the deeds, everyone owns this piece of property in common.  There was some additional discussion on the ordinance.  Ms. Van Buren asked if every single property owner on the street was a member of the association and Mr. Maxey said every property owner on Nightingale Trail was and there were one or two houses on North Ocean and North Lake as well.  Mr. Maxey said there were 23 separate memberships.  Ms. Van Buren asked about the finances and Mr. Maxey said there were annual dues of $75.00 a year and a common bank account of $3500 or $3600.  Mr. Maxey said that if a fine was incurred, that is probably where the money would come from but he did not believe, because of his fiduciary responsibility to the group, he could fight the decision with any of those monies.  Mr. Ochstein asked if he was an elected officer and Mr. Maxey said he was president and that he keeps the books and makes sure the place is in good condition.

          Mr. Fried advised Mr. Maxey that the Code Enforcement Board’s position was to enforce the Code and said that he had always found the Town Council members to be very receptive, individually and as a group.  Mr. Fried said it was not beyond the Town Council’s power and authority, if persuaded, to look into an ordinance and suggested Mr. Maxey address it with them.  

          

          

	B.	Case # 08-2508, 227 Brazilian Ave., 2F, Hillen J. Smith

          Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-241 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, building permits required to construct, install, repair or alter any building or building system

          

          Lead Code Enforcement Officer said Mr. Smith was found in violation, assessed $150.00 in administrative costs and given until July 16, 2008 to come into compliance.  Compliance has not been achieved so this is the time a fine would be assessed.  Mr. Walton said the contractor was present to speak.  

          

          Steve Pappanelli said he was hired by Mr. Smith after Mr. Smith had been cited and he was 90% complete with the job.  He was just waiting on his final inspection and he should have it by next week but the building is closed to all construction inspections for two (2) weeks. Mr. Pappanelli said he was present on Mr. Smith’s behalf to request a three (3) week extension.   Mr. Walton said the Town did not oppose the extension of time.  Mr. Walton said the three weeks was necessary because the building would not let inspections be done while their maintenance man was on vacation.  Mr. Walton said if compliance was not achieved by August 7, 2008 then he would ask for a $250.00 a day fine to commence on August 8, 2008.  

          

          Ms. Greenberg asked some questions about the type of permits and remarked that it is unfortunate in multi-family dwellings that this type of situation would exist to begin with because electrical and plumbing can have catastrophic effects on other owners.  She said it is unfortunate the people do not do the right thing until they get caught.  Mr. Pappanelli said he was not the contractor working without permits.  

          

          

          MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT AN EXTENSION OF TIME UNTIL AUGUST 8, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND TO ASSESS A FINE OF $250.00, RETROACTIVE TO JULY 17, 2008 IF COMPLIANCE WAS NOT ACHIEVED

		SECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG



		During discussion on the motion, Ms. Duemler stated she believed the retroactive 

          fine was a little harsh.  Mr. Ballentine said he agreed and asked the reason for the retroactive fine.  Mr. Ochstein said there are so many people who do work without a permit and they know they need a permit.  That is a very dangerous thing in a multi-family dwelling and it should be egregious.

VIII.	Fine Reduction:



	

     A.  Case # 08-2301, 167 E. Inlet Drive, The Landfall Group, 

          Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-242, Subsection 104.5.1.6, medium projects, all new or remodel construction projects 4000 sq. ft, to 8,999 sq. ft. under roof be allowed 22 months

          

          

          Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said in October, 2007, Ajax Equity LLC was found in violation of going over the construction time limits.  On November 15, 2008 they still were not in compliance and a daily fine of $250.00 started running. The final inspection was obtained in March, 2008.  The fine ran for 137 days prior to compliance being achieved and the accumulated fine due is $34,250.00 and the $150.00 hearing costs have not been paid.  

          

          Frank Lynch advised he was the attorney for both The Landfall Group and	Ajax.  He said when they appeared before the Board in October, Lazslo Wagner, the principal of The Landfall Group, who has built homes throughout the Town of Palm Beach for 26 years acknowledged he was unaware of this particular code provision.  Had he been, they would have applied for an extension of time to complete the construction.  At the hearing, Mr. Koeppel made a motion to allow them an additional sixty (60) days to complete the construction, find them in non-compliance and assess the $150 costs.  After a significant amount of discussion, that motion went to a vote and failed 4-3.  A second motion was made and Ms. Duemler thought the $250.00 fee was significant and believed the fine should be $125.00 a day.  Mr. Lynch gave Mr. Walton a copy of that transcript to put in the record.  As part of their request, they are asking the Board to consider what Ms. Duemler suggested at the meeting. At the same time, Mr. Lynch said he would like them to consider that The Landfall Group is a good corporate citizen and made a legitimate mistake.  As a result, a fine was incurred and they are willing to accept some level of fine, some level of responsibility for what they did.  The construction was continually on going, there were no delays other than the construction process itself.  This was not someone’s house, it was a speculative venture.  There had been some concerns with the shell contractor and the finish items themselves were significant enough that there were substantial delays.  At that same hearing, Code Enforcement Officer Gerry said it was the position of Code Enforcement to get more assertive at the suggestion of Town Council and that these projects were to be more aggressively pursued.  Under the new ordinance, for a house of approximately 5,000 sq. feet, they would be entitled to 24 months.  This would have brought them to November 2007 and they would have gotten additional time for Hurricane Wilma which would have brought them to December.  If they were under the new Code, they would not be before the Board today and may not have a fine at all.  He realizes a mistake was made, he realizes something has to be paid but he thinks $35,000 is a significant fine.  The Board has gotten their attention and they would ask for a significant reduction in the fine.

          

          Mr. Fried asked how long it took to get the final inspection after the 22 months had run.  Mr. Walton said they had been given 23 months due to the hurricanes and they were 5 months and 9 days beyond that.  Mr. Ballentine asked how far out they would be under the new rules.  Mr. Walton said they would be given 24 months which with the hurricane would be 25 months.  Mr. Lynch said that at the end of that 24 month period, if they had not sought an extension of time within the required time period, no earlier than 6 months and no later than 45 days, before the expiration of that 24 months, their project would have been shut down.  Mr. Wagner’s lack of knowledge of this particular situation would have become irrelevant because they would have been red tagged on the next day after the 24 month period.  Mr. Lynch said Mr. Wagner did not know because he has been a good corporate citizen and had never been before the Board except on one occasion which was beyond his control; it was a maintenance item on the Glazer house.  Mr. Walton said that situation was not due to Mr. Wagner’s fault, that he was just representing the owner.  

          

          Mr. Ballentine asked how Mr. Wagner did not know the Code requirement if he had built so many homes in the area and said he had difficulty with the ignorance of that. 

          

          Mr. Fried said he agreed with Mr. Ballentine and found it hard to believe that Mr. Wagner did not know the time limits. He said some reduction should be considered but he was not sure on what basis.  

          

          Mr. Ochstein remarked that the fine was around $35,000 and the house was on the market for $10.6 million dollars so he did not see the hardship.  Mr. Lynch said he did not know the price but he would accept Mr. Ochstein’s statement on that.  Mr. Lynch said the hardship was in the imposition of the fine itself, there were mistakes made and he believed that Council would have given them a significant extension of time if Mr. Wagner had been aware of the situation and filed the proper notice with Town Council.  

          

          Mr. Lynch said if some sort of arrangement could be reached today, his client would be in a position to pay within the next two weeks.  Mr. Hoffman said he was concerned because he believed that when the case was originally heard, they had the option of fining $250.00 a day and they gave them a fine reduction at the time they initiated the fine of $125.00 a day.  Mr. Walton corrected Mr. Hoffman, advising there was a motion for a fine of $125.00 a day which failed and the fine that was in effect was $250.00 a day.  Mr. Lynch said he believed the record reflects something different than that.  Mr. Walton said his records reflect $250.00 a day but he would review it.  Mr. Walton reviewed the transcript and noted that it showed $125.00 a day but the Board order specified $250.00 a day and he would have to do further research.  

          Mr. Fried advised he could make a motion to postpone the matter to the next meeting and have Mr. Walton bring back the correct information.  There was additional discussion about the amount of the fine and Mr. Lynch said he was seeking a reduction of the $17,125.00 which would be the amount of the fine if it was $125.00 a day.  Mr. Hoffman said he would find that hard to accept.  Mr. Hoffman read from the minutes that a motion was made by Mr. Fried that the defendant was found in non-compliance, ordered to pay an administrative fee in the amount of $150.00, obtain a final building inspection by October 25, 2008 and a fine of $125.00 to commence on October 26, 2007.  He said that motion passed 4-3.  Mr. Walton said he could not dispute that but he would have to do some research.  Mr. Hoffman said he would not be in favor of reducing the $17, 125.00 any further.  

          

          Mr. Ochstein said he was hesitant to do anything until they know what the number is. Mr. Walton suggesting postponing the case until next month.

IX.	Comments:



     Ms. Greenberg said that the presentation using the “slides” made it too dark in the room.  She wanted to know if there was anything they could do as a Board in making a suggestion to the Council about an ordinance that could address people not pulling permits because of the safety issues in terms of multi-family dwellings.  Capt. Blouin said there was a provision in place.  If work is done without a permit, there is a penalty involved.  There was an ordinance drafted last year that requires them to pay four times the permit fee.  

     

     Mr. Fried asked Mr. Randolph if he had spoken to Mr. Elwell about the foreclosure action being brought to the Board’s area of responsibility as opposed to the Town Council. Mr. Randolph said he had but did not have an answer yet and would try to get one.  Mr. Fried asked Ms. Houston about progress on the fines and she said the Town was now inputting fines into the computer system and if someone had outstanding fines they could not get any permits. People are contacting Code Enforcement because they cannot get permits and are either paying or asking to come back to the Board for a fine reduction.  

     

     Capt. Blouin advised that with regard to any foreclosure action, the police department is scrutinizing each and every one of them as some of these cases we have liens on were pre-existing prior to coming to the police department.  We do not want to bring a case to the board that can be handled in a different manner.  

     

     Mr. Walton remarked that it was a good thing that there are a number of working without permit cases being brought to the Board, that it means Staff is doing their job.

they will increasingly look to China for
security assurances. China does not have
a political agenda devoted to promoting
democratization, and it maintains
political and diplomatic ties with both
Arab states and Iran. China's military
activity in the region is modest but
increasing, as evidenced by its recent
peacekeeping dispatches to the region
and naval port visits in the Gulf. Beying

enhance its ability to protect the sea lanes
which bring oil to China's thirsty

United States has naval supremacy in the
Gulf, but will be working to erode that
strategic edge in the future.

Faced with these realities, there is a need
for new thinking and innovative
conceptualizations of surges into
Centcom's area of responsibility. Theater
campaign planners will have to think
about contingencies in which the United
States cannot slowly and methodically

kick off campaigns after most troops,

U.S. force build-ups in the region will be
far too vulnerable to preemptive nuclear

YouTube. You can hear the whole recording at the bottom of the post.

Here is what he said, unedited:

Steve Bannon: Thank you very much Benjamin, and I appreciate you guys including us
in this. We’re speaking from Los Angeles today, right across the street from our
headquarters in Los Angeles. Um. I want to talk about wealth creation and what wealth
creation really can achieve and maybe take it in a slightly different direction, because I
believe the world, and particularly the Judeo-Christian west, is in a crisis. And it’s really
the organizing principle of how we built Breitbart News to really be a platform to bring
news and information to people throughout the world. Principally in the west, but we’re
expanding internationally to let people understand the depths of this crisis, and it is a
crisis both of capitalism but really of the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian west in
our beliefs.

It’s ironic, I think, that we’re talking today at exactly, tomorrow, 100 years ago, at the
exact moment we're talking, the assassination took place in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz
Ferdinand that led to the end of the Victorian era and the beginning of the bloodiest
century in mankind’s history. Just to put it in perspective, with the assassination that
took place 100 years ago tomorrow in Sarajevo, the world was at total peace. There was
trade, there was globalization, there was technological transfer, the High Church of
England and the Catholic Church and the Christian faith was predominant throughout
Europe of practicing Christians. Seven weeks later, I think there were 5 million men in
uniform and within 30 days there were over a million casualties.

That war triggered a century of barbaric — unparalleled in mankind’s history — virtually
180 to 200 million people were killed in the 20th century, and I believe that, you know,
hundreds of years from now when they look back, we’re children of that: We’re children
of that barbarity. This will be looked at almost as a new Dark Age.

But the thing that got us out of it, the organizing principle that met this, was not just the
heroism of our people — whether it was French resistance fighters, whether it was the
Polish resistance fighters, or it’s the young men from Kansas City or the Midwest who
stormed the beaches of Normandy, commandos in England that fought with the Royal Air
Force, that fought this great war, really the Judeo-Christian West versus atheists, right?

The underlying principle is an enlightened form of capitalism, that capitalism really gave

CHAPTER TWENTY NINE

The Whistle Blower Who Became a Controlled Source

“The [U.S.] government’s investigation failed—that they don’t know what was taken”

—Edward Snowden in Moscow

In Moscow I had learned that Russian intelligence services use the broad, umbrella term
“espionage source” to describe moles, volunteers and anyone else who delivers another state’s
secrets to it. It applies not only to documents but to the secret knowledge that such a source is
able to recall and includes both controlled and uncontrolled bearers of secrets. It is also a job
description that fitted Edward Snowden in June 2013.

Unless one is willing to believe that the Putin regime acted out of purely altruistic motives in
exfiltrating this American intelligence worker to Moscow, the only plausible explanation for its
actions in Hong Kong was that it valued Snowden’s potential as an espionage source.

Snowden’s open disillusionment with the NSA presented the very situation that the Russian
intelligence services specialized in exploiting. He had also revealed to reporters in Hong Kong
that he had deliberately gained access to the NSA’s sources and methods and he that he had taken
to Hong Kong highly-classified documents. He further disclosed that, before leaving the NSA, he
had gained access to the lists of computers that the NSA had penetrated in foreign countries. He
even went so far as to describe to these journalists the secrets that he had taken as a “single point
of failure” for the NSA. And aside from the documents he had copied, he claimed, it will be
recalled, that he had secret knowledge in his head that, if disclosed would wreak havoc on the
entire U.S. foreign intelligence system. “If I were providing information that I know, that’s in
my head, to some foreign government, the US intelligence community would ... see sources go
dark that were previously productive, he told the editor of the Guardian in Moscow.

In short, he advertised possessing precisely the priceless data that the Russian intelligence
services had been seeking, with little success, for the past six decades. These electronic files could
provide it with the keys to unlock the NSA’s entire kingdom of electronic spying. Could any
world-class intelligence service ignore such a prize? To miss the opportunity to gets in hands such
a potential espionage source would be nothing short of gross negligence.

In fact, as has been already established in these pages, this golden opportunity was not missed in
Hong Kong. Even if the Russian intelligence service had not previously had him in its sights —
which, as discussed in chapter XV, appears to me to be extremely unlikely-- he made contact with
Russian officials in Hong Kong, and Putin, as he himself said, personally approved allowing

I only met Jeffrey Epstein, after I was adult. ( over 18). I was never, ever, his  sex slave  
. obviously a lurid chauvenistic categorization, which in my opinion could only have been 
made by some loser of a repressed male reporter. He was always kind , funny and generous to 
me. These fantasy fabrications made by a delusional thief. ( charged with stealing from the 
burger place and which she worked, though she claimed to paid thousands of dollars in cash 
and held at the beck and call of the genious tycoon. ) . Her story telling had it been done while 
sleeping would have been called dreaming, if awake, hallucinaitons but to the English press they 
are referred to as allegations. She claimed in the minutest of detail , her dinner with President 
Clinton on the Caribean Island, How he arrived . ( by black heli). where he sat. ,(on jeffreys 
left.) a 21st century tale of power, sex, money. The fact is that this story is total make 
believe , fabricated on purpose to gain tabloid attention ,and easily refuted by readily availalble 
travel records of a former president. . it defies belief that any person would take seriously such 
a preposterous story. little different than her telling her father that she met the queen, whoops- he 
believed her though her mother at the relevant time complained that she must have been 
engaging in satan worship and asked that she be put her in a drug home. cmon. I am currenty a 
professional pilot with a spotless record. I have a checklist that I follow before every flight to verify 
that things are what they are supposed to be, checking her story which the presss has refused to 
do would serve the public well. In this case human error is merely a euphmisn for hijacking the

issue, the Court finds that its action of striking the lurid details from Petitioners’ submissions is
sanction enough. However, the Court cautions that all counsel are subject to Rule 11’s mandate
that all submissions be presented for a proper purpose and factual contentions have evidentiary
support, Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1) and (3), and that the Court may, on its own, strike from any
pleading “any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).
B. Rule 15 Motion

Between their two motions (the Rule 21 Motion and Rule 15 Motion), Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 assert that “they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights [under the
CVRA] as well.” (DE 280 at 1). Although Petitioners already seek the invalidation of Mr.
Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement on behalf of all “other similarly-situated victims” (DE 189
at 1; DE 311 at 2, 12, 15, 18-19), Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 argue that they should be fellow
travelers in this pursuit, lest they “be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims” resulting
in “duplicative litigation” (DE 280 at 11). The Court finds that justice does not require adding
new parties this late in the proceedings who will raise claims that are admittedly “duplicative” of
the claims already presented by Petitioners.

The Does’ submissions demonstrate that it is entirely unnecessary for Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 to proceed as parties in this action, rather than as fact witnesses available to offer

relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative testimony. (See, e.g., DE 280 at 2 (Jane Doe 3 and

Jane Doe 4 “are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims”), 9 (“The new victims
will establish at trial that the Government violated their CVRA rights in the same way as it
violated the rights of the other victims.”), 10 (Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 “will simply join in

motions that the current victims were going to file in any event.”), 11 (litigating Jane Doe 3 and

"
IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031245.txt,"° You have stated that science provides answers to many of life’s biggest questions, and can even fix
great societal injustices.

° Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the
dearth of women and minorities in science. “Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias,” you
said. “It’s built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical
evidence.”

° You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail.

° Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently
pledging $100,000 in 2014.

° In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: “As a scientist | always judge things on empirical evidence and
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I’ve never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my
presumption is that whatever the problems were | would believe him over other people.”

° In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: “I remain skeptical, and | support a man
whose character | believe I know...If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.”

° You were made an honorary member of CFI’s board of directors in December 2011.

° A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post,

published at around the same time, described incident #5.

° The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault
were “potentially illegal.” The second post was quickly taken down.

Again, if you wish to comment on or clarify any of these points, please get in touch with us as soon as possible.
If |do not respond immediately it is because | am on another call, so please leave the best phone number to
reach you.

Hillary Clinton - Woman of the World

Jonathan Alter

June 2011 -- It was four a.m. when Hillary Clinton’s plane touched
down at Andrews Air Force Base, and by midmorning she was in the
Oval Office conferring with President Obama. The night before, as
her plane was en route from Tunis, they had agreed that the vote of
the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone on
Libya meant that it was now decision time on launching a third
American war in the Middle East, though no one in the U.S.
government dared call it that. Muammar Qaddafi was ramping up his
genocidal threats, pledging to show “no mercy” toward his own
people (whom he described as “rats’’) in the eastern city of Benghazi.
Inside the White House, the president quickly settled on an American
bombing campaign, but he and the secretary of state thought strongly
that Great Britain and France should be seen as taking the lead. They
agreed that there was no choice but for Hillary to sit down in person
with both British prime minister David Cameron and French
president Nicolas Sarkozy. “I’m sorry, Hillary, but you’re going to
fly over the Atlantic again,” said Obama, who was about to leave on
his own foreign trip, to Brazil. So only hours after landing from
Tunis, she was headed back to Paris.

By then it was clear that the “Arab Spring” of 2011 was creating
tumult not just in the Middle East but inside the Obama
administration. Not since the fall of Communism, in the late 80s, has
a U.S. administration faced a chain reaction of foreign crises that
seemed so much out of its control.

At first, Hillary looked clairvoyant: in January, when the street
protests were still small in Tunisia, she lectured decrepit dictatorial

country.” This provision does not differentiate between legal and non-legal migrant workers, nor
does it distinguish between forced labor and non-coerced mi grant labor. DOJ believes that any
international standard that we promote must mirror our domestic standards. Similarly, the new
subsection (a)(i)(4) could be read as encouraging countries to loosen their immigration laws,
‘something that the United States Government might not be willing to do.

Subsection (b) amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. § 2151 ef seq) to
provide specific assistance for anti-trafficking investigation and prosecution units in foreign
countries. This subsection could be construed as prioritizing sex trafficking over labor
trafficking. As stated above, DOJ believes that any international standard that we promote musi
mitror our domestic standards, which prioritize both sex trafficking and labor trafficking.
Further, the amendment to 22 U.S.C. § 2152(d)(a)(2) should include a reference to labor
trafficking and should, therefore, read “including investigation of individuals and entities that
may be involved in trafficking in persons involving sexual exploitation or forced labor.”

3. Section 104

The Department objects to the language in this section that specifies the groups with
which the United States Government must consult and coordinate in offering assistance and
protection to victims of human trafficking. Such language both places undue restrictions on the
United States Government and could limit the Government’s ability to deal with some necessary
groups. It has been the consistent practice of the Department to consult widely with a range of
stake holders and others before designing a program of foreign assistance on human trafficking,
Such an additional requirement in the statutory language is unnecessary. We suggest that the
language be amended to read, “[i]n cooperation and coordination with organizations which may
include the [UNHCR], the International Organization [for] Migration, and other relevant
organizations....”

4, Section 105

DOJ recommends that subsection (a) also require that the effectiveness of assistance
programs be measured based on best efforts to facilitate cooperation with law enforcement, along
with the other criteria.

5, Section 106

DOJ opposes the bar in subsection (b)(1) against including cases in which probation or
low sentences are given. Some of the most important cases are the ones against cooperating
defendants that result in minimal sentences in exchange for information or testimony. Embassies
Should have the discretion to take such situations into account when evaluating foreign
government efforts to combat trafficking. The Department recommends amending section
(b)(1)(B) by striking “shall not be considered to be an” and inserting in its place “shall be
considered on a case by case basis to determine if it will be considered an” so that it will give the tL
Secretary of State greater flexibility in evaluating the efforts of other countries. 7

status. Teaching future professors in one’s own field helps maintain
that status, so graduate students pursuing Ph.D.s are quite often taken
very seriously. Teaching graduate seminars is intellectually stimulat-
ing, may help with one’s own research, and is therefore worthwhile
to do. But undergraduates are a whole different story. Very small per-
centages of them actually will become researchers in one’s field. Pro-
fessors are in the fame game. They worry about the prestige of their
department and themselves. They care about this because they won’t
attract high-quality Ph.D. students unless they maintain that prestige.
Undergraduates do not figure into this equation. Except they do pay
the bills.

So professors have to teach them. And, someone has to teach those
damn introductory courses that typically have hundreds of students
in them. Why do they have hundreds of students in them? Because
no one wants to teach them so making the sections as large as possible
means fewer professors will have to teach them. And, why does our
aerospace guy want high school to teach the math his students need?
Because he certainly doesn’t want to do it. He wants to teach eso-
teric courses about composites, which is his field. Teaching basic math
would be worse than teaching Introduction to Aerospace. A great deal
of work and no enhancement to prestige at all. And, there is a bigger
problem. He can’t teach math because the structure of the university
doesn’t allow it.

Math is taught by the math department. If everyone had to learn
math, there would have to be an awful lot of math professors. While
that sounds OK, it really isn’t possible. Remember, at top universi-
ties everyone has to be a superstar or close. Math isn’t that hot of a
field. There aren’t large numbers of people wanting to become math
professors, nor is there a great deal of funding for math research. Re-
member, without outside funding as a possibility, a top university isn’t
going to want to create a big department. You get big departments,
and lots of professors, only in fields that pay for themselves through
outside funding. So math has to stay small. Solution—make sure math
is taught in high school.

This solution makes everyone in the university happy. And, it
shouldn’t be a big surprise that the original idea of requiring alge-
bra of high school students came from the president of Harvard and
the chairman of the Princeton Math Department (in 1892). It has al-
ways been in the university’s interest to push teaching the basics that

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031535.txt,"We rolled into action. A crisis management team was set up, the Board of Regents promptly informed
(first through the leadership), and an initial recommendation made. Specifically, | commissioned
Baylor’s Faculty Athletic Representative (a post required under NCAA procedures) to conduct an internal
inquiry into the charges. By design, the “FAR” operates outside of and independent of the Athletic
Department. Serving in a watchdog capacity, a form of “check and balance,” the FAR reports directly to
the president. Respected law professor Jeremy Counsellor took on the role, and within several days,
reported back — in a one-page summary that contained only the background of his appointment and his
solitary recommendation — that an outside investigation should be conducted. That is, no one inside or
connected to the university should be retained to provide a truly independent, honest assessment of the
situation.

So it was that Pepper Hamilton, a respected Philadelphia law firm, was retained. Their work began in
early September 2015, and came to conclusion in May 2016. To assure the independence of its work,
the Pepper Hamilton lawyers reported directly to a special three-person committee of Baylor’s Board of
Regents. That structure remained in place throughout the lengthy process, culminating in a verbal
report — with numerous power point slides — to the Board of Regents in mid-May 2016. The final work
product was two-fold: a set of findings of fact, reported by the Board of Regents, and a lengthy set of
recommendations from the law firm. There was no “report” in the traditional sense. The Board’s
findings and Pepper Hamilton’s recommendations were publicly released, leading to events that |
describe in the next chapter.

The findings were deeply troubling. Moral outrage was the order of the day, throughout the country.
This was page one, above-the-fold news. Searing criticism unfolded, not simply of the football program
but overall the University’s stewardship with respect to interpersonal violence (including sexual assault)
was found wanting. The criticisms were directed atincluded what | call “first responders,” including
campus law enforcement, health services and counseling. Pepper Hamilton’s findings were summarized
as a “fundamental failure” on the part of the University. This quickly became the prevailing narrative.
The narrative was reinforced by additional victims coming forward — some of whom had graduated —
about their tragic experiences. These were chronicled in dramatic ways by ESPN’s go-for-the-jugular
program, “Outside the Lines.” Baylor — not just the football program — became a pariah.

Victims’ stories moved the thoughtful observer or listener to a powerful combination of empathy and
outrage. One’s heart goes out to the victim; a second later, waves of outrage wash over the empathetic
observer. How could this have happened? Who fell asleep at the switch? Who failed to protect these
young women, and why? Did coaches turn a blind eye to reports of unconscionable acts by superstar
players — or even non-superstars who abused (or worse) young women?. Did “first responders” on the
University’s payroll turn a deaf ear to distraught complaints of sexual violence, including rape? How
could this be, especially at a self-professed Christian university?

Entitlement Spending: Observation About Social Security & Medicare

Part A Trust Fund — More Like Accounting Values Than Real Dollars

e Social Security Trust Fund balance (accumulated annual surpluses + interest income) = $2.5 trillion as of
2009; Medicare Part A Trust Fund balance = $304 billion as of 2009. These surpluses were invested in a
special (non-marketable) series of U.S. Treasury securities, which were then used to finance budget deficits
in other parts of USA Inc. like Medicaid & Nutrition Assistance.

e As aresult, many observers have argued that Social Security and Medicare Part A Trust Funds’ balances
are no more than accounting gains on paper owing to: 1) no ‘real’ assets (such as tradable stocks / real
estates...) in these Trust Funds as the special U.S. Treasury securities are non-marketable and 2) the
Treasury Department needs to raise taxes / cut other programs’ spending / borrow more money in the future

to meet any withdrawal requests.

e We think that for Social Security and Medicare Part A programs, their Trust Funds’ balances have legal
value as USA Inc. is legally obliged to repay the principal and interest on the Treasury securities held in
respective Trust Funds.

e However, we think that these Trust Fund balances have NO economic value as these cumulative surpluses
have been spent by USA Inc. to reduce the borrowing need in the past. When Social Security & Medicare
begin net withdrawal from their Trust Funds (likely in 2017E), USA Inc.’s debt levels + interest payments
growth could accelerate, owing to the double whammy of: 1) loss of revenue source (previous surpluses)
and 2) additional Treasury redemption costs related to Trust Funds’ withdrawal requests.

e Consequently, we exclude Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds’ balances and interest income
from our financial models and calculate their liabilities on a net basis.

Then, during his confirmation hearings
on January 31, Hagel — under hostile
questioning from several Republican
senators — backed away from earlier-held
positions on Iran, including the role of
sanctions. And, though he previously
been a sharp critic of a military attack on
Iran, in his opening statement Hagel said:
“T am fully committed to the President’s
goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a
nuclear weapon, and—as I’ve said in the

achieve that goal. My policy is one of
prevention, and not one of containment—
and the President has made clear that is
the policy of our government. As
Secretary of Defense, I will make sure
the Department is prepared for any
contingency.”

Satloff's views were echoed by another
tough-talking official at WINEP, former
Ambassador Dennis Ross, a pro-Israel
hawk who served as Obama’s top adviser
on Iran during much of the president’s
first term. “I think 2013 is going to be
decisive,” Ross told the Los Angeles
Times, expressing concern about Hagel’s
previous comments. “Time really is

was consumed with shame. At 16 years old, he isolated her and made himself her only
emotional support system. Her mental torment and pain turned into depression. She was

The final contact between IEEE and Mr. Epstein was when he tracked her
parent’s house phone number in Kansas and tried to speak to her. J mother
grabbed the phone and told Mr. Epstein she was calling the police before hanging up on him.

Her career dwindled to nothing. Taking a break from the modeling industry when clients

no framework with which to reference what a “normal” sexual experience was. She remains

Florida Bar that reference information that was developed during discovery in this case. In
keeping with plaintiff's enduring practice of insisting on selective confidentiality to bolster her
own accusations while concealing evidence that undermines her claims, the materials provided to
the Post include cherry-picked and misleading characterizations of evidence that is sealed and/or
designated confidential under the protective order governing this action—to say nothing of the
fact that it is simply false. In several instances, the materials plaintiff's counsel provided to the
Post directly reproduce exhibits that were marked confidential in this case by plaintiff, and which
plaintiff filed under seal before the district court. These disclosures violate both the spirit and
the letter of the district court’s orders, and appear calculated to hamstring Professor
Dershowitz—who respects and will abide by the court’s orders—in responding to the
accusations against him.

Most notably, the materials provided to the Washington Post repeat the
outrageous claim that [MY “came forward” and “corroborated” Ms. Giuffre’s
accusations against Dershowitz when she “testified under oath that she had been trafficked by
Mr. Epstein and had had sex with Mr. Dershowitz.” As plaintiff's counsel are well aware, Ms.
MEE testimony is marked confidential and remains under seal; indeed, plaintiff herself
filed the relevant deposition transcript under seal before the district court. See ECF No. 701-1.
Yet the materials provided to the Washington Post repeat specific details from M6§. =
sealed deposition, including specific sex acts she claims occurred with specific individuals.
Plaintiffs counsel’s selective characterization of this sealed evidence to a national newspaper is
an outrageous violation of the district court’s orders. See ECF No. 62 4 4 (“CONFIDENTIAL
information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this
case.””); see also, e.g., Taylor v. Teledyne Techs., Inc., 338 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1343 (N.D. Ga.
2004) (publicly summarizing and paraphrasing confidential documents violated protective order
even without verbatim disclosure).

This is especially so given that the totality of this individual’s testimony and other
documents produced confidentially in discovery (none of which plaintiffs counsel elected to
describe to reporters) demonstrate that her claims are utterly unworthy of belief.' Among other
things, in emails sent in 2016, Ms. HMMIclaimed that she received help from “the Russians”
and the hacker network Anonymous in responding to a hack of her email by the CIA; that Hillary
Clinton sent “Special Agents Forces Men” to “intimidate[]” and “ruff[] (sic)... up” her friend in
an effort to “to protect [Ms. Clinton’s] presidential campaign”; that she possessed video and
photographic evidence against both Ms. Clinton and Donald Trump that she would release to

Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and Richard Branson having sex with her friend which was backed

throughout Europe”; and that another friend had—while the two “were showering together”—

public behavior on trial. The nature of that behavior, for the Mueller
team, is corrupt; this, according to the White House, is how voters
elected the President to behave.

The Special Counsel seems less worried about its legal position
than it does about it’s existential one—continuing to anticipate how the
President might use his authority to move against it.

It sees its most immediate threat as a move by the President to
replace Rosenstein. Here it believes that in the inevitable Supreme Court
battle that would follow a direct attempt by the President to fire the
Special Counsel, the Court would likely rebuff such an expansion of
Presidential authority. At the same time, according to its internal
research, the Mueller team understands that the President, acting with
only somewhat more subtlety, would have the authority to order the
Attorney General—even given his prior recusal—to repeal the Special
Counsel regulations and close down the investigation. He can fire the
Attorney General if he refuses. The President, could, too, according to
the Special Counsel's analysis, fire Rosenstein and seek someone else to
oversee the investigation in ways more to his liking. Both of these
actions could, the Special Counsel believes, become part of the behavior
that it argues in the indictment amounts to a prima facie case for
obstruction of justice.

The Mueller team continues to believe it is protected by political
realities—the President can not know how Congress might respond, and
it might well respond with impeachment—and by bureaucratic ones.
Changes to the Special Counsel authorization might require an extended
comment period, meanwhile leaving the Special Counsel's status
unchanged.

Still, what if the President, acting unilaterally, does shut it down?
This, people around the President say is the unknown legal area that
might be advantageous to the President. The delays and disruption that
result as courts sort out the ramifications of the President's actions
might well be the President's legal friend—the reason some in the
White House have been urging the President to end the investigation,
whatever the political fallout.

If so, what then happens to all the work the Special Counsel's
office has done, and, indeed, to the sitting Grand Juries reviewing the
evidence? The special counsel's view, according to insiders working on
the issues, is that nobody knows. The optimistic legal view is that the

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012875.txt,"The sweetness of control

When humans and other animals travel the road to excess, whether for food consumption, violence,
power, or sex, it is either because they gave in to an in-the-moment impulsive itch or because a history of
losing self-control turned into an addictive habit. What causes us to lose our sense of moderation, allow
our mental brakes to slip, and give in to temptation? What causes our preferences to inconsistently and
irrationally shift over time, allowing seductive offerings to win? If you are the eminent social
psychologist Roy Baumeister who has contributed fundamental insights into the nature of evil, the answer
is simple: sugar. Love it. Want it. Need it.

When we work hard, focusing on a difficult problem or trying to figure out the best decision,
exhaustion strikes. Part of our exhaustion comes from the fact that we have depleted a critical resource:
sugar, or more precisely, glucose. When the availability of this resource diminishes, we also lose self-
control. This is why the loss of self-control has a cycle that follows the time of day, with the greatest
losses occurring late rather than early: diet breakers are more likely to pig out in the evening than early in
the morning; shoppers are more likely to buy impulsively as the day moves on; impulsive crimes and
relapses of addiction are evening affairs; judges are more likely to dole out punishment at the end of a day
in court than when they start a new day. Dozens of experiments show that if you have to exert self-
control in one context it taxes your capacity to exert self-control in another. For example, if you ask
subjects to avoid laughing while watching a comedy routine, avoid thinking about a white bear, or avoid
eating chocolates now to have radishes later, these same subjects will squeeze a hand grip for a shorter
period of time than subjects who never contended with the various self-control tasks. When you deplete
your personal resources, you lose your grip, opening yourself up to binge eating, unnecessary violence,
sexual promiscuity, and drug relapses.

How do we know that glucose is responsible? If you give people a milkshake with real sugar
before they have to take a hard test involving self-control, they do better than if you give them a
milkshake with an artificial sweetener. If you first make people take a test that taxes their attention, and
causes their glucose to drop, they do worse on a subsequent test, including the hand grip squeezing test. In
an extraordinary series of experiments and observations, the American psychologist Nathan DeWall
found that subjects who drank lemonade with glucose were less likely to respond aggressively to an insult
than subjects who drank lemonade with artificial sweetener; individuals with diabetes — who have
difficulty regulating blood glucose, and thus have less of it— reported higher levels of aggression on a
questionnaire than non-diabetics; within the United States, those states with higher numbers of diabetics
showed higher crime rates; and countries with a higher frequency of a genetic disorder that lowers

glucose levels showed higher killing rates both in and out of war.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029055.txt,"Questioner: Very simply put, there’s a growing movement among young people here in
Europe, in France and in Austria and elsewhere, and they’re arguing very effectively
against Wall Street institutions and they’re also appealing to people on an ethnic and
racial level. And I was just wondering what you would recommend to counteract these
movements, which are growing.

Bannon: One of the reasons that you can understand how they’re being fueled is that
they’re not seeing the benefits of capitalism. I mean particularly — and I think it’s
particularly more advanced in Europe than it is in the United States, but in the United
States it’s getting pretty advanced — is that when you have this kind of crony capitalism,
you have a different set of rules for the people that make the rules. It’s this partnership of
big government and corporatists. I think it starts to fuel, particularly as you start to see
negative job creation. If you go back, in fact, and look at the United States’ GDP, you look
at a bunch of Europe. If you take out government spending, you know, we’ve had negative
growth on a real basis for over a decade.

And that all trickles down to the man in the street. If you look at people’s lives, and
particularly millennials, look at people under 30 — people under 30, there’s 50% really
under employment of people in the United States, which is probably the most advanced
economy in the West, and it gets worse in Europe.

I think in Spain it’s something like 50 or 60% of the youth under 30 are underemployed.
And that means the decade of their twenties, which is where you have to learn a skill,
where you have to learn a craft, where you really start to get comfortable in your
profession, you’re taking that away from the entire generation. That’s only going to fuel
tribalism, that’s only going to fuel [unintelligible]... That’s why to me, it’s incumbent upon
freedom-loving people to make sure that we sort out these governments and make sure
that we sort out particularly this crony capitalism so that the benefits become more of this
entrepreneurial spirit and that can flow back to working-class and middle-class people.
Because if not, we’re going to pay a huge price for this. You can already start to see it.
Questioner: I have a question, because you worked on Wall Street. What is the opinion
there on whether they think bank bailouts are justified? Is there a Christian-centered
[unintelligible | that they think should be bailed out? The crisis starts earlier than 2008.
What was the precedent then? What was the feeling on Wall Street when they bailed out

the banks? How should Christians feel about advocating or being against that?

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031253.txt,"Incident 5:

° This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your
female companion for sex in your cabin.

° At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged
CFI’s president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise,
however.

Incident 6:

° During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once
again.

° The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker.

° With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie.

° As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her
right breast.

° She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. “Don’t do that,” she said.

° BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College

of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand
in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have
confirmed the complainant's account of what happened.

° In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016
incident.

° On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting
appointments.

° Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But
neither university found against you.

° “Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate
the allegations,” Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her.

° Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State’s Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an
inquiry “did not find a violation of university policy.”

° In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints

of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university’s senior associate general counsel,
noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. “The University did

not find either communication to state a credible allegation,” Jewett wrote.

Miscellaneous facts:

° In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since.

e Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with
biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America’s leading public
intellectuals.

° You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and are a
vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031247.txt,"advice from I wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over
emails from that period. I have numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually
had to turn down because I was busy, and on several occasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee with her
off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a
BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on
campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat even students as respected colleagues if possible. I was
shocked when I later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least
because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because, well after the dates you listed on which she
was apparently offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS
conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation
to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her off at her hotel,
and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass
her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was
shocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and
providing the emails in question, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed at that
time to be called for, and that the young woman in question had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the
complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult
decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with
my colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona
at the time I was asked not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to
respect her sensitivities and also because it was basically moot because I was not on campus. I was also told
that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by,
and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the complaint from
my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you.

Re item 6: You report on ASU’s response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically
stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and
morever the outside complaints were in fact related specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to
mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed,
who never lodged a complain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was
surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by
both Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private
events unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both
ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been
violated. . In addition ANU’s investigation, which took a full month found significant inconsistencies in the
allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which
in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you
made in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated

It is the University’s understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the
time of the incident.”

After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again
moot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated
information inconsistent with the original claim and apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which I
quote:

The allegations were made by an observer to the incident.

- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched
in

an unwelcome manner.

prosecution agreement with them. (DE 280 at 3; see id. at 7-8). However, the bulk of the Rule
21 Motion consists of copious factual details that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 “would prove” “[ilf
allowed to join this action.” (Id. at 3, 7). Specifically, Jane Doe 3 proffers that she could prove
the circumstances under which a non-party introduced her to Mr. Epstein, and how Mr. Epstein
sexually trafficked her to several high-profile non-party individuals, “including numerous
prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known
Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” (Id. at 3-6). She names several individuals, and she
offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they took place. (See id. at 5)

At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary to the
determination of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 should be permitted to join Petitioners’
claim that the Government violated their rights under the CVRA. The factual details regarding
with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent
to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed
them CVRA duties), especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not
related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.

The original Rule 21 Motion (DE 279) shall be stricken in its entirety, as it is wholly
superseded by the “corrected” version of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 280). From the corrected Rule
21 Motion, the Court shall strike all factual details regarding Jane Doe 3 between the following

The impact of a lower corporate tax rate on company earnings is directly proportional to
the difference between the current domestic tax rate and the proposed tax rate. The
impact is calculated by taking the difference between the current tax rate and the
proposed tax rate, and dividing it by (1-current tax rate).

To calculate the impact of a lower corporate tax rate on the S&P 500 earnings, we can

ECONOMICS: US PERSPECTIVES
NATIONAL DEFENSE: IS ANOTHER SPENDING
BOOM ON THE HORIZON?
+ Joseph G. Carson, US Economist and Director—Global Economic Research, joe.carson@abglobal.com
President Trump has promised to increase defense spending—and
there’s support from key members of Congress. If a large multiyear
plan is approved, it would represent a sharp reversal from what has
beentheweakesttrendindefensespendinginthepast50years.
And the timing and scale would have important implications for the
outlook on growth and inflation.
National Defense—The Trump Plan
President Trump has promised to deliver
an ambitious program to rebuild the US
military. It would include modernizing
US nuclear weapons systems, investing
more in cybersecurity, enlarging the navy’s
fleet and increasing the number of fighter
aircraft for the air force. Trump’s plan also
includes additional military personnel—well
over 100,000, according to some
estimates.
The details of Trump’s first Pentagon
budget will form part of the overall budget
he’ll submit to Congress in late February or
early March. The actual funding request for
the current fiscal year (which ends
September 30) must be completed by April
30—that’s when the current legislation
funding the military budget is set to expire.
More important, Trump’s blueprint for the
Pentagon budget could set the baseline
for defense spending for at least the next
four years. It’s also worth noting that
Trump’s military expenditures could be at
the low end of what some in Congress are
proposing.
For example, Senator John McCain, who
chairs the Senate Armed Services
Committee, recently released a white
paper on defense spending, Restoring
American Power. McCain argues that the
US has underinvested in the military for
several years, and that it is now vital for
the US to substantially increase funding for
the Pentagon. His plan calls for a $640
billion defense budget for fiscal year 2018,
which is $58 billion above the current
budget baseline. Moreover, the McCain
defense plan urges an additional $430
billion in military spending over the next
five fiscal years.
Defense Spending Patterns Are Unlike
Other Federal Programs
History shows that defense spending
programs are unusual in that they’re neither
cyclical nor countercyclical. Most often they
are based on military and political strategiesaswellasongoingreadinessto
respond to or engage in global encounters.
Based on historical gross domestic
product (GDP) data, there have been three
large defense-spending programs in the
past 50 years (Display 1). The first buildup

occurred in the mid-1960s, during
President Lyndon Johnson’s term, and ran
for five years. That was tied to the military
engagement in Southeast Asia.
The second large defense-spending boom
occurred during the first four years of the
Reagan presidency. This buildup was part
of Reagan’s political and military strategy
to rebuild the military apparatus after what
he saw as years of neglect.
The third major increase started during the
first term of President George W. Bush.
This one was linked to events surrounding
9/11 and the following events in the
Middle East.
1
From a political and military standpoint, the
Trump defense plan parallels the goals and
objectives of President Reagan’s military
push. And with McCain’s more aggressive
plan aligned on the same premise of
modernizing and improving the readiness
of the US military, Trump will likely have the
backing of this influential member of the
Republican congressional leadership.
Today’s Economic Backdrop—
Similar to the 1960s
The economic and financial implications of
a large, multiyear defense-spending plan
must be weighed against the economic
environment at the time of implementation.
And from a historical context, today’s
conditions have more similarities to the
economic setting of the mid-1960s than
during the defense buildups of the early
1980s or early 2000s, which were either
in recession or the very early stages of
recovery.
Incontrast,theUSeconomyinthemid-
1960swasalreadyinitsfifthyearof
expansion, the jobless rate of 4.5% was
relatively low and inflation was tame
(roughly 1.5%). Nonetheless, the extra
defense spending boosted domestic
demand growth and added significant
pressure to labor costs, materials and
supplies, and product prices. So much so
that the acceleration in consumer price
inflation(from1%in1961tonear6%in
1970)fromthestarttotheendofthat
businesscyclewasoneofthelargestof
any economic growth cycle during the
postwar period.
Today’s economic backdrop looks similar in
many ways. The economy has been in
recovery for seven years, the jobless rate is
in the mid-4% range and inflation is stable
(at around 2%). While many domestic and
global factors are different now, we would
still expect a large multiyear defensespending
program to add to growth and
put upward pressure on labor costs and
inflation in the coming years. Keep in mind
that we’re coming off the weakest five-year
defense spending trend in the past 50
years, so Trump’s defense spending need
not match any of the prior three to have a
major impact.
Stay tuned for the unveiling of Trump’s
budget and pay close attention to the
defense spending request. A large
multi-year program would definitely lift
inflationary pressures. While we wouldn’t
expect an acceleration like that in the
1960s, a sustained rise of 100 to 200
basis points in general inflation would still
seem reasonable—and far above what the
Federal Reserve and financial markets are
currently expecting. n

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011108.txt,"Tax cuts can be faster-acting than spending programs because they obviate the
construction period. Freshwater economists argue plausibly that they are likely to
prove ineffective. They foresee “rational expectations” of taxpayers as predicting
eventual restoration of the taxes when full employment resumes. This gives a
motive to save the tax cut rather than spend it as intended. | see it a little differently.
Most consumption is maintenance or investment to keep up human capital. We will

need that earning power when taxes are restored.

Say’s Law

Jean Baptiste Say, in writings I haven’t read, argued two centuries ago that supply
creates its own demand. The logic is sound to a point. The claims on output simplify
to pay plus profit. The asterisks don’t matter here. Thus pay plus profit is always
enough to clear that market. There could be “partial gluts” when we produced too
much of one thing and not enough of another, but never a “general glut” where

production got ahead of our means to pay for it.

All too true. Consumption plus investment equals pay plus profit. But the sad fact is
that profit can be negative. Deadweight loss happens. When it happens, at the
collective scale, even pay claims may be left unsatisfied. Say’s law gives no comfort

except where outcomes are as expected.

Tax Considerations

Schultz in 1962 argued that educational (human) capital is overtaxed. What he
wrote was: “The established tax treatment takes account of both depreciation and
obsolescence in the case of physical capital, but this accounting is not extended to
human capital”. He was right. Income tax is charged on net profit of firms and pay of

workers. Pay measures gross realized work including human depreciation.

Tax laws now counter that imbalance by applying lower rates to pay as “earned

income”. If we could measure human depreciation, or model it with enough

Getting to the Endgame
With Iran

Robert Dreyfuss

February 6, 2013 -- Why did it take so
long to secure a date for talks between
Iran and the P5+1?

After all, in the weeks before the
presidential election in November, it was
reported that the United States and Iran
had already tactically agreed to convene
private, one-on-one talks. And since then
the United States, the European powers,
Russia, and China, all sought to arrange
another round of negotiations, first in
December and then in January. It now
appears that Iran, which is about to enter
its presidential election season, has
finally agreed to what will be the first
round of negotiations with the P5+1 since
the last round in Moscow seven months
ago. On Tuesday, Tehran announced that
it will join talks on February 26 in
Kazakhstan.

The negotiations will be a serious test for
the Obama administration and for John
Kerry, the new secretary of state.
Previous rounds have all faltered because

believe that, more specifically, Epstein's attorneys knew of Epstein's scheme to recruit minors for
sex and also knew that these minors had civil actions that they could bring against him. In fact,
there was much communication between Epstein's attorneys and the United States Prosecutors in
a joint attempt to minimize Epstein's civil exposure. For example, on October 3, 2007, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Marie Villafafia sent an email (attached hereto as Exhibit “D”) to Jay Lefkowitz,
counsel for Epstein, with attached proposed letter to special master regarding handling numerous
expected civil claims against Epstein. The letter reads in pertinent part,

The undersigned, as counsel for the United States of America and
Jeffrey Epstein, jointly write to you to provide information relevant to your
service as a Special Master in the selection of an attorney to represent several
young women who may have civil damages claims against Mr. Epstein. The
U.S. Attorney's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (jointly referred
to as the United States) have conducted an investigation of Jeffrey Epstein
regarding his solicitation of minor females in Palm Beach County to engage in
prostitution. Mr. Epstein, through his assistants, would recruit underage
females to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd conduct in
exchange for money. Based upon the investigation, the United States has
identified forty (40) young women who can be characterized as victims
pursuant to 18 USC 2255. Some of those women went to Mr. Epstein's home
only once, some went there as much as 100 times or more. Some of the
women's conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while
Mr. Epstein-masturbated himself. For other women, the conduct escalated to
full sexual intercourse. As part of the resolution of the case, Epstein has
agreed that he would not contest jurisdiction in the Southern District of Florida

the revolutionary youth, having been one of the first to call for the
downfall of the old regime and to advocate less conventional means
of opposition. Yet it is odd that the field is now dominated people
and groups that, in the past, had reached accommodations with the
old regime, even if they had been in the opposition. In fact, it is
precisely these circles that have provided most of the presidential
candidates who are currently flitting from one press interview to the
next.

All this will enter another phase with the legislative elections in
September, at which time we will be able to speak of actual popular
representation. Until then, every candidate, party and group will
claim that they speak for the people, the masses, and the nation,
and they will continue to do so in increasingly strident tones all the
way to the polls, which will ultimately sort day from night.

One naturally wonders who will come out ahead in the forthcoming
electoral battle, which will probably be one of the most crucial
moments in Egyptian history. Certainly, the general lay of the field is
already clear. It is characterised by two main orientations, one
religious, the other secularist. The Muslim Brotherhood, represented
by its Freedom and Justice Party, leads the former camp, which also
consists of Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya, the Egyptian Jihad and the various
shades of Salafis. They are likely to win the sympathy of quite a few
Sufi orders as well as a number of the old NDP apparatchiks who
often rallied against the Ahmed Nazif government in the pre-
November 2010 parliament. The other camp, which is championed by
a broad front of the movements that spearheaded the revolution and
similar coalitions, is beginning to coalesce in political party form,
although there is little to suggest that their parties will be familiar
enough to the public or sufficiently prepared by election time.
Nevertheless, they will be joined by Egyptian Christians, most of the
liberal and leftist parties, such as the Wafd, the Nasserist Party and

to think hard about jobs, economics or globalization. It got its
support wholesale — by simply being the only authentic vehicle for
protest against the regime. Now the Muslim Brotherhood is going to
have to get its votes retail — I hope.

This is the key question: Will a united, legitimate, authentic,
progressive, modern, nationalist alternative to the Muslim
Brotherhood get its act together and challenge the Islamists in the
Egyptian elections, and then rule effectively? Woody Allen famously
pointed out that 80 percent of life is showing up. Wrong. Eighty
percent of life is getting stuff done. The Egyptian centrists from
Tahrir Square now need to show that they can form parties to get
good stuff done. Nobody pays wholesale anymore.

Two months later, on October 28, the lawyer called Rodriguez,
who insisted once more on being paid for the information. The

What the lawyer knew and Rodriguez did not know was that
the associate in question was an undercover employee (UCE) of

guez and sets up a meeting, which takes place the following day.

“During the meeting, Rodriguez produced a small bound

continues:

Rodriguez explained that he had taken the bound book from

he had previously lied to the FBI. Rodriguez asked the UCE
about the $50,000, took possession of the money, and began
counting it.

Rodriguez was then detained for Obstruction of Official

Rodriguez waived his rights and signed a written waiver of

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032000.txt,"DEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone’s groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back to business. Peggy
Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her famous friends. Nice work if you can get
it.

In 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for Platoon,” he immediately turned to a domestic arena
and began working on Wall Street in New York City where his father had been a stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen
as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of
finance (as seen through the Hal Holbrook character) and an homage to his father.

At the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers from his earlier
Scarface script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both groups had an animalistic need to obtain
big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and greed.

Oliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud Fox, a kid from
nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust into the fast lane with a rock star
financial mentor who teaches him corruption.

Oliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. Michael was not
known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver also saw the anger, confidence,
salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked
back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael’s most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one
could ever forget.

When Gekko delivers his speech, Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works,” cinematic history was
made.

“Wall Street” was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire financial services
industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it.

Four years ago, Wall Street’s producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film Entertainment co-
chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board pending script approval. Steven Schiff
wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered it obsolete.

Alan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the social rhythms of
New York’s financial high society. Whereas Gekko’s character was modeled after ‘70s junk bond kings (Michael Milken) and ‘80s
mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike
Novogratz, geniuses who have created stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko’s wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to
direct, he rewrote a portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit.

This past September, Oliver yelled, action as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he emerges from a
lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to redefine himself in a different era. The
New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2.

A week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver designs an elaborate
tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake Moore, a young idealistic investment banker
played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko’s daughter Winnie, Moore’s fiancée, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an
off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011646.txt,"The Kenyans were not exactly allies of Israel. But relations between
President Jomo Kenyatta’s security services and Mossad had been close for
some years. I flew in with three leading Mossad men. While one of them called
on the aging President Kenyatta, our main point of contact, was the head of
Kenya’s security services. Since the secrecy of the mission had to be preserved,
we couldn’t make advance preparations for refueling or the additional 707
which we intended to fly in as a field hospital. But he smoothed the way for us
to do both, without anyone asking too many questions.

The Mossad men took the lead in arranging to get Rabin’s questions
answered. They contacted a pilot they knew. The pilot flew to Entebbe early on
Saturday morning, circled, and, after he was cleared to land, claimed
mechanical difficulties and flew out again. I had his telephoto pictures by mid-
morning and phoned Rabin’s intelligence officer to let him know we’d
confirmed there was a clear path to the old terminal. We still had to make sure
the captive passengers were there, however. A nurse from Kampala who had
been allowed to visit them made three further visits: late Saturday afternoon,
then shortly after the first Hercules had taken off from Sharm al-Sheikh, and
finally around nine at night. I was able to reassure Rabin that the question to his
second question was also “yes”. Although all of the C-130s were already
airborne, it was only then that he gave the mission the final go-ahead.

As commander of Sayeret Matkal, Pd always found running an operation
from a command post hugely frustrating. This was even worse. Once we got
word the Israeli force was on the way to Uganda, we put in place the
arrangements for refueling. If all went well, the first C-130, with Yont’s assault
team and at least some of the hostages, was due to reach Entebbe and begin the
assault at midnight Saturday. Assuming there were no major problems, it would
take an hour at most. All / could do now, from 300 miles away, was wait.

Shortly after midnight, Kuti radioed me with a terse message: the first of the
Hercules had left Entebbe for Nairobi, and the command plane was returning to
Israel. About quarter to one in the morning on July 4, the transport planes began
their staggered arrival. When the first Hercules taxied to a halt, I went out to
meet it. As its giant rear door lowered, Dan was the first person I saw. I could
tell from the awkward silence, the lack of any greeting, something must have

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024949.txt,"The global financial crisis took all countries by surprise and was much bigger than any economy or large
companies across the world. It is not really helpful for anyone to claim wisdom in hindsight. Learning the
lesson well is the true bottom line of this crisis. I have always repeated that only the one who works is one who
is likely to commit errors. But the most important thing 1s to learn not to repeat the same error twice. Definitely
gaps that may be revealed through current reform efforts will be immediately addressed and rectified.

By Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper

Your Highness, you have put Emiratization on top of the country’s development
priorities. Over the years, the UAE population has grown significantly to the extent that
expat residents have become absolute majority. Meanwhile, number of private sector
companies has significantly increased as well. How do you see this impacting the UAE
nationals’ job opportunities? Do you believe it might be necessary to expand the
Emiratization plan to cover a larger portion of the private sector companies?

The Emiratization plan is primarily based on training and qualifying UAE nationals, equipping them with all
necessary tools and competencies and supporting them to confidently compete in the job market. I am positive
that most of the private sector companies prefer to recruit UAE nationals as part of their Corporate Social
Responsibilities. Also salaries of UAE nationals — however high they may appear to be - are far less than those
of expats. Employing a UAE national will open the door for more interaction with government departments and
local customers, who are eventually the highest spenders. If some companies fall short of their responsibilities
toward the local workforce, then the government will intervene through a set of measures and incentives to
encourage these companies to live up to the expected level of responsibility.

By Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper

Many countries have applauded the UAE’s hospitality and praised the level of respect it
shows to the expat communities and the freedom it offers them to lead their business and
social lives in perfect ease. This encouraged many expats to reside in the UAE for long
period of time, evolving the same habits and traditions of the local community as well as
significant loyalty to this country. Some of those expats felt optimistic about recent
announcements made by some real estate companies that property buyers in certain
projects in Dubai or Ajman will be offered “permanent UAE residency.” Other
companies have completely closed the door of speculation regarding the same issue. How
does the government perceive=2 Othe “Permanent Residency” promise? And are there
any eventual plans to adopt it in the UAE?

Offering residency is absolutely far beyond the jurisdiction of any real estate company. It is a sovereign issue
governed by laws and regulations. But I wonder if one buys property in London, Paris, Cairo, or Beirut does this
mean obtaining a permanent residency there? We are very keen to ensure convenient conditions for expat
property owners. However, we will be issuing a new law that includes a long multi-visit permit soon.

DALAL ABU GHAZALA, Al Hayat Newspaper

The UAE has proven remarkable capability in managing previous crises, including the
Gulf First or Second Wars and 9/11 events in the US. What are the steps endorsed by the
country’s supreme leadership to overcome the current financial crisis? And do these
measures include re-evaluating the UAE’s strategy and its plans for the coming few
years?

For America to remain the great country it has been for the past 235 years,
it must determine the best ways to honor the government’s fundamental
mission derived from the Constitution:

...to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility,
provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the
blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

To this end, government should aim to help create a vibrant environment for
economic growth and productive employment. It should manage its operations
and programs as effectively and efficiently as possible, improve its financial
position by driving the federal government's income statement to long-term
break-even, and reduce the unsustainable level of debt on its balance sheet.

KP
i USA Inc. | Introduction 7

USA Inc. Concept

Healthy financials and compelling growth prospects are key to success for businesses
(and countries). So if the US federal government — which we call USA Inc. — were a
business, how would public shareholders view it? How would long-term investors evaluate
the federal government's business model, strategic plans, and operating efficiency? How
would analysts react to its earnings reports? Although some 45%1 of American households
own shares in publicly traded companies and receive related quarterly financial statements, not
many “stakeholders” look closely at Washington’s financials. Nearly two-thirds of all American
households? pay federal income taxes, but very few take the time to dig into the numbers of the
entity that, on average, collects 13%? of all Americans’ annual gross income (not counting
another 15-30% for payroll and various state and local taxes).

We drill down on USA Inc.’s past, present, and (in some cases) future financial dynamics and
focus on the country’s income statement and balance sheet and related trends. We isolate and
review key expense and revenue drivers. On the expense side, we examine the major
entitlement programs (Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) as well as defense and other
major discretionary programs. On the revenue side, we focus on GDP growth (driven by labor
productivity and employment in the long run) and tax policies.

We present basic numbers-driven scenarios for addressing USA Inc.'s financial challenges. In
addition, we lay out the type of basic checklists that corporate turnaround experts might use as
starting points when looking at some of USA Inc.’s business model challenges.

specifically, how do we get businesses
to do more in terms of hiring, spend
Iess on redtape, less on bureaucracy,
and reduce the regulatory burden in
smart ways?
The current administration has said
some of the right things but actually
moved in the wrong direction. We have
seen a sharp increase in the last couple
of years in what are deemed to be
major economically significant rules.
That is defined as regulations that impose
a cost on the economy of $100 million
or more.
According to the administration's Office
of Management and Budget, the
current administration has been regu-
Iating at a pace of 84 major rules per
year. By way of comparison, that is
about a 50-percent increase over the
regulatory output during the Clinton
administration, which had about 56
rules per year, and an increase from
the Bush administration as well. So we
have seen more regulations and more
significant regulations.
I was encouraged to hear President
Obama's words when he talked about
the Executive order in January, which
is entitled Improving Regulation and
Regulatory Review. But now we need
to see action. We need to see it from
the administration, from individual
agencies to provide real regulatory relief
for job creators to be able to reduce
this drag on the economy.
One commonsense step we can take is
to strengthen what is called the Unfunded
Mandates Relief Act. It was
passed in 1995. It was bipartisan. I was
a cosponsor in the House of Representatives.
It is an effort to require Federal
regulators to evaluate the cost of rules,
to look at the benefits and the costs,
and to look at less costly alternatives
on rules.
The two amendments I would like to
offer over the next few days as we consider
the legislation before us would
improve this Unfunded Mandates Reform
Act, and it would reform it in
ways that are entirely consistent with
the principle President Obama has laid
out and committed to in his Executive
order on regulatory review.
The first amendment would require
agencies specifically to assess potential
effects of new regulations on job
creation-so focusing in on jobs-and
to consider market-based and nongovernmental
alternatives to regulation.
This would broaden the scope of
the Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to
require cost-benefit analysis of rules
that impose direct or indirect costs of
$100 miilion a year or more. So, again,
this is for major rules of $100 million or
more. It would also require agencies to
adopt the least costly or least burdensome
option that achieves whatever
policy goals have been set out by Congress.
It seems to me it is a commonsense
amendment. I hope we will get
bipartisan support for it.
The second amendment would extend
the Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to
so-called independent agencies which
today are actually exempt from the
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
- SENATE
cost-benefit rules that govern aII other
agencies. In 1995, we had this debate
and determined at that time we would
not extend the legislation to independent
agencies. In the interim, independent
agencies have been providing
more and more rules, have put out
more and more regulations, and are
having a bigger and bigger impact. An
example of an independent agency
would be the SEC, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, or the CFTC,
which is the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. These are agencies
that, although independent in the executive
branch, are very much involved
in putting out major rules and regulations.
It is sometimes called the headless
fourth branch of government because
their rules are not reviewed for
cost-benefit analysis, even by the OMB,
the Office of Management and Budget,
in its Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, so-called OIRA.
We have looked at some GAO data
and put together various studies, and it
appears to us that there are about 200
regulations that were issued between
1996 until today that would be deemed
to have an impact of $100 million or
more on the economy but were automatically
excluded from the Unfunded
Mandates Relief Act because they were
deemed to be from independent agencies.
So it is basically closing a loophole
and closing this independent agency
loophole, which I believe is a sensible
reform. It has been endorsed by many
people, including, interestingly, the
cument OIRA Administrator and the
President's regulatory czat, Cass
Sunstein, who, in a2002 Law Review article,
talked about the fact that this is
an area where UMRA ought to be extended
because, again, there were so
many independent agencies that were
putting out regulations impacting job
creation in this country.
No regulation, whatever its source,
should be imposed on American employers
or on State and local governments
without serious consideration of
the costs, the benefits, and the availability
of a least-burdensome alternative.
Both these amendments would
move us further toward that sensible
goal, and I hope the leadership will
allow these amendments to be offered.
I think they fit well with the underlying
legislation. If they are offered, I
certainly urge my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to support them.
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence
of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO LOUIS E. GIVAN
Mr. MoCONNELL. Mr. President, I
rise today to recognize a distinguished
Kentuckian who has worked tirelessly
on behalf of our Nation's soldiers, sailors
and marines for more than 40 years.
Louis E. Givan, a lifelong resident of
my hometown of Louisville, has played
a vital role in protecting the men and
women of our Armed Forces and our
country's defense.
Formerly a sailor himself in the U.S.
Navy, he has served for the last 11
years as the general manager of
Raytheon Missile Systems operations
in Louisville. I was saddened to hear of
his retirement from that position this
coming July 5. He will certainly be
missed.
Mr. Givan-or, to those who know
him, Ed-was a 1966 graduate of St. Xavier
High Schooi in Louisville and in
1970 earned his bachelor of science degree
in mechanical engineering from
the J.B. Speed School of Engineering
at the University of Louisville. In 1968,
he began working at the Naval Ordnance
Station in Louisville, and he
stayed at that post until 1996, in various
engineering and supervisory positions.
In 1996 the Naval Ordnance Station
transitioned to private ownership, and
Ed's leadership was crucial in making
that transition a successful one. The
facility eventually became part of
Raytheon Missile Systems, and Ed was
appointed general manager in 2000. As
general manager, Ed has led Raytheon
Missile Systems in Louisville to great
success, success for both the company
and for the local community. They design,
develop, and produce vital weapons
systems for our armed forces, enabling
America to have the most formidable
military force in the world.
Weapons produced at the Louisville facility
are used by our forces in all parts
of the globe, including in Iraq.
Kentucky is lucky to have benefitted
from Ed's dedication, commitment to
excellence, and leadership for so many
years. I am sure his wife Velma; his
sons Eddie, Tony, and Chris; and his
grandchildren Benjamin, Nathan,
Isaac, Macy and Natalie are all very
proud of what Ed has accomplished. I
wish him the very best in retirement,
and I am sure my colleagues join me in
saying that this U.S. Senate thanks
Mr. Louis E. Ed Givan for his faithful
service.

U.S. Ssllero,
Washington, DC, June 6, 2011.
Hon. ERIC H. HOLDER. Jr..
AttmneA General\ U.S. Department of Justice,
Washington, DC.
DEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL HoLDER: I am
writing about the Justice Department's implementation
of the Crime Victims' Rishts
Acb-an act that I co-sponsored in 2004.
These questions relate to an Office of Legal
Counsel (OLC'1) Opinion made public on
May 20, 2011 and more broadly to concerns I
have heard from crime victims' advocates
that the Department has been thwarting effective
implementation of the Act by failing
to extend the Act to the investigative phases
of criminal cases and by preventing effective
appellate enforcement of victims' rights. I
am writing to ask you to answer these questions
and explain the Department's actions
in these areas.
GOVERNMENT PROTECTION OF VICTIMS' RIGIITS
DURING INVESTIGATION OF A CRIME
When Congress enacted the CVRA, it intended
to protect crime victims throughout
the criminal justice process-from the investigative
phases to the final conclusion of a
case. Congress could not have been clearer in
its direction that using best efforts to enforce
the CVRA was an obligation of
[o]fficers and employees of the Department
of Justice and other departments and agencies
of the United States engaged in the detection,
inaestigd,tion, or prosecution of crime
. . . . 18 U.S.C. 93771(c)(1) (emphasis added).
Congress also permitted crime victims to assert
their rights either in the court in which
formal charges had already been filed ,,or, if
no prosecution is underwag, in the district
court in the district in which the crime occurred.
18 U.S.C. gBZTI(dXB) (emphasis
added).
Despite Congress'clear intention to extend.
rights to crime victims throughout the process,
the Justice Department is read.ing the
CVRA much more narrowly. In the recent
OLC opinion, for example, the Department
takes the position that ,,the CVRA is best
read as providing that the rights identified
in section 3771(a) are guaranteed. from the
time that criminal proceed.ings are initiated
(by complaint, information, or indictmenr)
and cease to be available if all charges are
dismissed either voluntarily or on the merits
(or if the Government declines to bring formal
charges after the filing of a complaint).',
The Availability of Crime Victims, Rights
Under the Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2004,
Memorandum from John E. Bies (Dec. 12,
2010, publicly released May 20,2011) (hereinafter
OLC Opinion). Indeed, in that same
opinion, I am surprised to see the Depart_
ment citing a snippet from my floor remarks
during the passage of the CVRA for the prop_
osition that crime victims can confer with
prosecutors only after the formal filing of
charges. See id. at 9 (citing 1b0 Cong. Rec.
54260, 54268 (Apr. 22,2004) (statement of Sen.
Kyl).
I did want to express my surprise that your
prosecutors are so clearly quoting my re_
marks out of context. Here is the full pas_
sage of my remarks, which were part of a
colloquy with my co-sponsor on the CVRA.
Senator Feinstein:
Senator Feinstein: Section . . . (a)(b) pro_
vides a right to confer with the attorney for
the Government in the case. This right is in_
tended to be erpansiue. For example, the vic_
tim has the right to confer with the Govern_
ment concerning any critical stage or dis_
position of the case. The right, howeuer. is not
limited to these eramples. I ask the Senator if
he concurs in this intent.
Senator Kyl: Yes. The intent of this sec_
tion is just as the Senator says. This risht to
confer does not give the crime victim any
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATE June 8,2011
right to
-
direct the prosecution. Prosecutors right to fair treatment and their right to
should consider it part of their profession to confer with prosecutors when the Justice Debe
available to consult with crime victims partment is negotiating pre-indictment plea
about concerns the victims may have which agreements and non-prosecution agreements
are pertinent to the case, case proceedings or with defense attorneys, including negotiadispositions.
Under this provision, uictims are tions within the Fifth Circuit?
able to confer with the Gouernment's attorneA
about proceedings after charging.
150 Cong. Rec. 54260, 54268 (Apr. 22, 2004)
(statements of Sens. Feinstein & Kyl) (emphases
added). Read in context, it is obvious
that the main point of my remarks was that
a victim's right to confer was intended to
be expansive. Senator Feinstein and I then
gave various examples of situations in which
victims could confer with prosecutors, with
the note that the right to confer was not
limited to these examples. It is therefore
troubling to me that in this opinion the Justice
Department is quoting only a limited
portion of my remarks and wrenching them
out of context to suggest that I think that
crime victims do not have any right to confer
(or to be treated with fairness) until after
charging.
In giving an example that the victims
would have such rights after charging, I was
not suggesting that they had no such right
earlier in the process. Elsewhere in my remarks
I made clear that crime victims had
rights under the CVRA even before an ind.ictment
is filed. F or example, in the passage
quoted above, I made clear that crime victims
had a right to consult about both ,,the
case and case proceedingg',-i.g., both
about how the case was being handled before
being filed in court and. then later how the
case was being handled in court ,,proceedings.
As another example, Senator
Feinstein and I explained that we had drafted
the CVRA to extend a right to victims to
attend only public proceedings, because
otherwise the rights would extend. to grand
jury proceedings. See, e.g., lbO Cong. Rec.
54260, 54268 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statements of
Sens. Feinstein & Kyt). Of course. no such
limitation would have been necessary under
the CVRA if CVRA rights attach (as the Department
seems to think) only after the filing
of a grand jury indictment.
Courts have already rejected the Justice
Department's position that the CVRA applies
only after an indictment is filed.. For
example, in In re Dean, b2T F.gd 891 (bth Cir.
2008), the Department took the position that
crime victims had no right to confer with
prosecutors until after the Department had
reached and signed a plea agreement with a
corporation (BP Products North America)
whose illegal actions had resulted in the
deaths of fifteen workers in an oil refinery
explosion. Of course, this position meant
that the victims could. have no role in shaping
any plea deal that the Department
reached. In rejecting the Department's position,
the Fifth Circuit held that ,,the govern_
ment should have fashioned a reasonable
way to inform the victims of the likelihood
of criminal charges and to ascertain the victims'
views on the possible details of a plea
bargain. Id. at 394.
In spite of this binding d.ecision from the
Fifth Circuit, crime victims' ad.vocates have
reported to me that the Justice Department
is still proceeding in the Fifth Ciicuit and
elsewhere on the assumption that it has no
obligations to treat victims fairly or to con_
fer with them until after charges are for_
mally filed. Given the Fifth Circuit,s Dean
decision, this position appears to place the
Department in violation of a binding court
ruling that extend.s rights to thousand.s of
crime victims in Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Texas. And more generally, the bepart_
ment's position simply has no grounding in
the clear language of the CVRA.
My first question: What is the Justice De_
partment doing to extend to victims their
SRIME VI6TIMS, RIGIIT To AppETTLATE
pRorEcrroN
Protection of crime victims' rights in appellate
courts is an important part of the
CVRA. As you know, when Congress passed
the CVRA, the federal courts of appeals had
recognized that crime victims could take ordinary
appeals to protect their rights. See,
e.g., Doe u. United States, 666 F.2d 43, 46 (4th
Cir. 1981) (rape victim allowed to appeal district
court's adverse rape shield statute
ruling); United States v. Kones,77 F.3d 66 (3rd
Cir. 1996) (victim allowed to appeal adverse
restitution decision). Congress sought to
leave these protections in place, while expanding
them to ensure that crime victims
could obtain quick vindication of their
rights in appellate courts by providing-in
$3771(d)(3)-that [i]f the district court denies
the relief sought, the [victim] may petition
the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.
18 U.S.C. S3771(d)(3). Ordinarily,
whether mandamus relief should issue is d.iscretionary.
The plain language of the CVRA,
however, specifically and clearly overruled.
such discretionary mandamus standard.s by
directing that [t]he court of appeals shall
take up and decide such application forthwith
. . . . 18 U.S.C. S3771(d)(3) (emphasis added).
As I explained when the Senate considered
the CVRA:
[W]hile mandamus is generally discretionary,
this provision [18 U.S.C. gB??1(d)(g)]
means that courts must review these cases.
Appeilate review of denials of victims' rights
is just as important as the initial assertion
of a victim's right. This provision ensures review
and encourages courts to broadlg d.efend.
the victims' rights.
150 CoNG. REc. 54270 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement
of Sen. Kyl) (emphases added). Simi-
Iarly, the CVRA's co-sponsor with me, Senator
Feinstein, stated that the Act would
create a new use of a very old procedure,
the writ of mandamus. This provision will
establish a procedure where a crime victim
can, in essence, immediately appeal a d.enial
of their rights by a trial court to the court
of appeals. 150 CoNG. REc. 54262 (statement
of Sen. Feinstein) (emphases added); see also
id. (statement of Sen. Kyl) (crime victims
must be able to have the appellate
courts take the appeal and order relief). In
short, the legislative history shows that
$ 3771(d)(3) was intended to allow crime victims
to take accelerated appeats from dis_
trict court decisions denying their rights and
have their appeals reviewed. under ord.inary
standards of appellate review.
In spite of that unequivocal legislative history,
the Justice Department has in past
cases asserted a contrary position. In In re
Antrobus, 519 F.3d 1123 (10th Cir. 200g). Ken
and Sue Antrobus sought to obtain appellate
review of a ruling by a trial court that they
could not deliver a victim impact statement
at the sentencing of the man who sold the
murder weapon used to kill their daug:hter.
The Tenth Circuit ruled against them on the
basis that the Antrobuses were not entiiled
to regular appellate review, but only discre_
tionary mandamus review. See id. at Il24_25.
The Tenth Circuit did not consider the legis_
lative history in reaching this conclusion,
leading the Antrobuses to file petitions for
rehearing and rehearing en banc-petitions
that recounted this legislative history. In re_
sponse, the Justice Department asked the
Tenth Circuit to deny the victims' petitions.
Remarkably, the Justice Department told
the Tenth Circuit that it could ignore the
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 85-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2011 Page 4 of 4
June 8, 2011
Iegislative history because the CVRA is unambiguous.
Response of the United States,
In re Antrobzs, No. 08-4002, at 72 n.7 (10th Cir.
Feb. 12, 2008).
At the time that the Justice Department
filed this brief, no Court of Appeals agreed
with the Tenth Circuit. At the time, three
other Circuits had all issued unanimous rulings
that crime victims were entitled to regular
appellate review. See /n re W.R,. Hufl
Asset Mgmt. Co.,409 F.3d 555, 562 (2d Cir. 2005);
Kenna, u. US. Dist. Ct. for the Cent. Dist. of Ca.,
435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2006): In re Walsh,
229 Fed.Appx. 58, at 60 (3rd Cir. 2007).
My next question for you is, given that the
Justice Department has an obligation to use
its best efforts, 18 U.S.C. $377f(c)(1), to afford
crime victims their rights, how coutd
the Department argue in Antrobus (and later
cases) that the CVRA unambiguously denied
crime victims regular appellate protections
of their rights when three circuits had
reached the opposite conclusion?
GOVERNME}TT'S RIGIIT TO ASSERT ERROR
DENIAL OF VICTIMS' RIGI{TS
To further bolster protection of crime victims'
rights, Congress also included an ad.ditional
provision in the CVRA---SBZT1(dX4)-
allowing the Justice Department to obtain
review of crime victims' rights issues in appeals
filed by defendants: ,,In any appeal in
a criminal case, the Government may assert
as error the district court's denial of any
crime victim's right in the proceeding to
which the appeal relates. 18 U.S.C.
$3771(d)(4). The intent underlying this provision
was to supplement the crime victims'
appeal provision found in gBTZI(d)(B) by permitting
the Department to also help develop
a body of case law expanding crime victims,
rights in the many defense appeals that are
filed. It was not intended to in any way narrow
crime victims' rights to seek relief
under S3771(dX3). Nor was it intended to bar
crime victims from asserting other remedies.
For instance, it was not intend.ed. to block
crime victims from taking an ordinary appeal
from an adverse decision affecting their
rights (such as a decision denying restitution)
under 28 U.S.C. 51291. Crime victims
had been allowed to take such appeals in various
circuits even before the passage of the
CVRA. See, e.9., United States u. Kones. 77
F.3d 66 (3rd Cir. 1996) (crime victim allowed.
to appeal restitution ruling); United, States u.
Perry,360 F.3d 519 (6th Cir. 2004) (crime victims
allowed to appeal restitution lien
issue); Doe u. United States,666 F.2d 48.46 (4th
Cir. 1981) (crime victim allowed. to appeal
rape shield ruling).
As I explained at the time the CVRA was
under consideration, this provision supplemented
those pre-existing d.ecisions by
allow[ing] the Government to assert a victim's
right on appeal even when it is the de_
fendant who seeks appeal of his or her con_
viction. This ensures that victims' rights are
protected throughout the criminal justice
process and that they do not fall by the way_
side during what can often be an extend.ed.
appeal that the victim is not a party to. 1b0
CoNG. REc. 54270 (Apr.22,2004) (statement of
Sen. Kyl).
I have heard from crime victims' advocates
that the Department has not been actively
enforcing this provision. Indeed, these ad.vocates
tell me that they are unaware of even
a single case where the Department has used.
this supplemental remedy. My final question:
Is it true that the Department has

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES
SERGEANT VORASACK T. XAYSANA
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President. it is
with a heavy heart that I rise today to
honor the life and heroic service of
SGT Vorasack T. Xaysana. Sergeant
Xaysana, assigned to the Headquarters
and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion,
based in Fort Hood, TX, died on
April 10, 2011. Sergeant Xaysana was
serving in support of Operation New
Dawn in Kirkuk, Iraq. He was 30 years
old.
A native of Westminster, CO, Sergeant
Xaysana enlisted in the Army in
2005. During over 6 years of service, he
distinguished himself through his courage
and dedication to duty. Sergeant
Xaysana's exemplary service quickly
won the recognition of his commanding
officers. He earned, among other decorations,
the Iraq Campaign Medal, the
Global War on Temorism Service
Medal, and the Army Good Conduct
Medal.
Sergeant Xaysana worked on the
front lines of battle, serving in the
most dangerous areas of Iraq. Mark
Twain once said, The fear of death fol-
Iows from the fear of life. A man who
lives fully is prepared to die at any
time. Sergeant Xaysana's service was
in keeping with this sentiment-by
selflessly putting country first, he
lived life to the fullest. He lived with a
sense of the highest honorable purpose.
At substantial personal risk, he
braved the chaos of combat zones
throughout Iraq. Though his fate on
the battlefield was uncertain. he
pushed forward, protecting America's
citizens, her safety, and the freedoms
we hold dear. For his service and the
lives he touched, Sergeant Xaysana
will forever be remembered as one of
our country's bravest.
To Sergeant Xaysana's parents,
Thong Chanh and Manithip, and to his
entire family, I cannot imagine the
sorrow you must be feeling. I hope
that, in time, the pain of your loss will
be eased by your pride in Vorasack's
service and by your knowledge that his
country will never forget him. We are
humbled by his service and his sacrifice.
GRAZING IMPR,OVEMENT ACT
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. president, I rise
today to submit for the REcoRD an article
written by Karen Budd-Falen and
published May 28, 2011, in the Wyoming
Livestock Journal. The article's tiile is
Leveling the Playing Field: Support
for the Grazing Improvement Act of
2071.
The title of the article is instructive.
Anyone living and working in rural
communities knows the playing field is
not level. The National Environmental
Policy Act has become the preferred
tool to delay and iitigate grazing permit
renewals for American ranchers.
Livestock grazing on public lands has
a strong tradition in Wyoming and all
Western States. Ranchers aie proud
s3609
stewards of the land, yet the permitting
process to renew their permits is
severely backlogged due to litigation
aimed at eliminating livestock from
public land.
During times of high unemployment
and increasing food prices, we need to
be encouraging jobs in rural economies.
We need to be fostering an environment
to raise more high quality, safe,
American beef and lamb; not litigating
less.
That is why I introduced the Grazing
Improvement Act of 2011. This legisiation
will provide the certainty and stability
public grazing permit holders
desperately need in order to continue
supporting rural jobs, providing
healthy food, and maintaining open
spaces for recreation and wildlife.
It is time to help level the playing
field for hard working ranching families
across the West. Their livelihood
should not be held hostage by litigation
and anti-grazing special interest
groups. I thank my colleagues, Senators
ENzr, CRApo, HATOH, HELLER,
RrscH, and TnuwE, in supporting ranching
families and this legislation.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent
to have printed in the RpconD the
article to which I referred.
There being no objection, the material
was ordered to be printed in the
RncoRo. as follows:
[From the Wyoming Livestock Roundup,
May 28, 20111
LEVELTNG rnp Pr,eyruc Frulo: SuppoRT FoR
THE GRAZING IMPRoVEMENT AcT oF 2Ou
(By Karen Budd-Falen)
If jobs and the economy are the number
one concern for America, why are rural communities
and ranchers under attack by radical
environmental groups and overzealous
federal regulators?
America depends upon the hundreds of
products that livestock provide, yet radical
groups and oppressive regulations make it
almost impossible for ranchers to stay in
business. Opposition to these jobs comes in
the form of litigation by radical environmental
groups to eliminate grazing on public
lands, radical environmental group pressure
to force voluntary gtazing permit buyouts
from willing sellers, and holding permittees
hostage to the court deference given
to regulatory experts. The playing field is
not level and the rancher is on the losing
side. The Grazing Improvement Act of 2011
will level the playing field. I urge your sup_
port.
The Grazing Improvement Act of 2011 does
the following:
1. Term of Grazing Leases and permits.
Both BLM and Forest Service term grazing
permits are for a 10-year term. This bill ex_
tends that term to 20 years. This extension
does not affect either the BLM's or Forest
Service's ability to make interim management
decisions based upon resource or other
needs, nor does it impact the preference
right of renewal for term grazing permits or
leases.
2. Renewal, Transfer and. Reissuance of
Grazing Leases and Permits. This section
codifies the various ,,appropriation riders
for the BLM and Forest Service requiring
that permits being reissued, renewed or
transferred continue to follow the existing
terms and conditions until the paperwork is
complete. Thus, the rancher is not held hos_
tage to the ability of the agency to get its

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018295.txt,"Inevitably, Castells became curious about how such a change was affecting politics.
Speaking to an audience at Harvard in the spring of 2014, he reviewed what he had
learned in the past decade - and particularly in the years since 2008, much of which
he had spent dropping into the ground-zero sites where network protest and
dissatisfaction were exploding. “We are witnessing,” he told the audience, “the birth
of a new form of social movement.”®? Information technology was breeding massive,
rapidly moving social waves. These movements went from invisible to irresistible in
instants. They pressed for political change or for economic justice or even for - and
this was odd for such wired up efforts, but anyhow - a return to a pre-technological
age. In most of these countries, the older organizations had little appeal to anew
generation of protesters. The political parties smelled of rot. The media was state-
owned or controlled by billionaires. For a generation used to instant empowerment,
the time to work inside these broken structures seemed impossibly long. And,
anyhow, another option existed. Twitter or Facebook or YouTube had taught them.
So riots in those dozens of cities, unplanned and uncontrolled, emerged.** The
“Collective Action,” of popular movements for hundreds of years from Bastille-
raiders to labor actions, was replaced - upgraded? - into “Connective Action.”
People who'd never met and who shared very different histories and desires, were
connected, fused together by lightspeed bits in hope or fury or vengeful rage.®> This
was, perhaps, predictable. It mirrored the linked, fast-spreading dynamism of the
2008 crisis itself. As the British central banker and economist Andy Haldane
observed, the world had never before suffered a genuinely global financial crisis,
with every county on the planet, tied together as they were by finance and
technology (and fear), tumbling off a cliff at the same, nano-second instant. ®¢ In one
three month period, the entire global economy shrunk by five percent.

As fast as shocks like that economic one spread, these linked network social
reactions seemed to move faster still, echoing each other, with ever louder and more
complex results. The technology itself became as important to the emergence of new
groups as their ideas. The terror phenomenon of ISIS, for instance, emerged almost
entirely along skeins of digital connection, and was itself a reaction to the network-
led disruption of the Arab Spring - and the earlier fracturing of older order in Iraq.
When President Obama dismissively called ISIS the junior-varsity squad of terror
and said there was nothing much for the West to worry about, he was reflecting the

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

Dinner with Oliver Stone

“T had to ‘tune to [Snowden’s] wavelength’ and try to balance between the rational and intuitive perception of his
world. Having experienced these incredible sensations, I realized that I had to write about them, but only in the
form of a novel that would not claim any sophisticated philosophical conclusions.

—Anatoly Kucherena

Before flying to Moscow, I arranged to have dinner with Oliver Stone at Parma, an Italian
restaurant on the upper east side of New York. I had greatly respected Stone ability as a film
director after watching him work in Wall Street IT: Money Never Sleeps, a film in which I had a
cameo role. I also had debated Stone about the historic accuracy of his 1990 movie JFK at Town
Hall in New York.

When we dined, he had just written, produced, written and directed “Snowden,” an
independently-financed film depicting Snowden, as put, as “one of the great heroes of the 21*
century.” In preparing for it, he had not only seen Snowden in 2013 and 2014, but he had had a
six-hour meeting with Putin.

The reason I wanted to talk to him was not to learn about the film but to find about how he
had made to gain access to Snowden in Moscow. I already knew from the documents taken
from Sony Pictures Entertainment allegedly by North Korea that Stone had paid the Guardian
$700,000 for the film rights to “The Snowden File,” a book written by Luke Harding. This was
not a surprising sum since it provided a basis for movie which describes Snowden’s coup. But
these documents also revealed that Stone had paid Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden’s legal
representative in Moscow, $1 million dollars, supposedly for the rights to his novel Time of the
Octopus. Even by Hollywood standards one million dollars was an extraordinary sum to pay for
a yet-to-be published work of Russian fiction, and it was especially striking since Stone was
making a fact-based movie using the actual names of the characters. “Is your script based on
Kucherena’s “Time of the Octopus?” I asked.

“No,” Stone replied, “I haven’t used it.” He said that the payment was for what he termed
“total access.” He explained that Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, the producers of the
James Bond franchise, had optioned Greenwald’s book “No Place to Hide” to make into a movie

subsidies such as FHA and FNMA and FMAC which began before I was born. As itis, I
don’t see enough evidence either way to assert whether houses or the publicly
traded corporate sector, cap-weighting its stock and bonds, should be risker. But

even that uncertainly is a surprise in view of what we all were taught.

Depreciation theory is one of my favorites. It doesn’t upset the applecart as much as
the pay rule does, because little economic theory depends on it. I love it because it
reverses tradition precisely. National accounts model depreciation as declining
exponentially. | model it as rising exponentially. It’s the same equation with a plus
sign in place of a minus sign. | love its obviousness once we think about it. It follows
when we remember the present value rule. Once we do, evidence for both factors
makes more sense. Depreciation theory rounds out the pay rule in explaining how
pay can rise or hold steady to the very end. And we see the same in businesses.
Gross realized profit, analogous to pay, does not tend to decline as firms approach a
date with the wrecking ball. My impression has been that rents go down when
properties aren't kept up or locations become unfashionable, but not with age in
itself. When it’s time to demolish and rebuild, premises are more typically vacated
with trade still running at norms. Gross realized profit is inevitably all depreciation

on the last day, and would approach zero steadily if tradition were right.

There may have been minor novelty in my derivation of my three fundamental
theorems as at least subjective certitudes following from definitions, and in my idea
itself of subjective as distinct from empirical certitude. A subjective certitude is one
such that contrary evidence would falsify the convergence axioms. | have found little
or no empirical certitude past the cogito. | concede that the idea of subjective

certitude is impertinent. How dare we infer what people must think?

We dare when we infer from definitions. | began with the somewhat unusual
definition of capital (value) as perceived means of foreseen taste satisfactions. The

usual “means of production” is equally valid, but less suited to my purpose here. |

ending.

Within two weeks, at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein is now
standing with his filmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The film wins
The Audience Prize. Their strategy is to say nothing. Do nothing. They
have a possible Oscar winner. Four out of five past Best Pictures have
premiered in Toronto.

Cut to New York City at the end of September. It's the opening night at
The Film Society of Lincoln Center. One of America's most important and
prolific producers Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew
Garfield and Aaron Sorkin are in a brightly lit box waving down to their
equally hysterical audience who have just seen The Social Network.

The film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David
Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Aaron Sorkin
becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for an Oscar.

The Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a
launching pad for 127 Hours, where cool Yale/NYU student James Franco
appears and receives a heroic standing ovation. More Oscar buzz.

Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec

Baldwin and even Harvey Weinstein slip in the back. Darren Aronofsky,
sporting the ever present cool wool scarf around his neck is hailed a
genius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress.

Both films are sensational and movie goers go nuts, but it is The
King's Speech that edges out the competition for The Audience Prize.

Mid-November David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg, working together for
the third time, sneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience
erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, Clint Eastwood is
going to kill himself for not directing this. Wahlberg says, You are
wrong. He turned it down because he's done it. He has seen it and he
loves it. I instantly lavish my affection and praise on David O.
Russell, who becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa
Leo are hailed the supporting actors to beat.

True Grit directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott
Rudin doesn't premiere till mid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last
serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office
gold.

AT&T confirms it paid Trump lawyer 
Michael Cohen for 'insights' on 
administration 
11:57 AM ET Fri, 4 May 2018 01:18 
Getty Images 
Michael Cohen, longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, 
arrives at the United States District Court Southern District of New York on April 26, 2018 
in New York City. 
Telecommunications giant AT&T said Tuesday night that it had paid President Donald  
Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen for insights about the Trump administration. 
AT&T's admission came after a lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels claimed the company, 
drug giant Novartis and a Russian oligarch had all made payments to Cohen's shell 
company. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 016218 
Daniels lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said AT&T had made four separate payments of $50,000  
apiece to Cohen's company, for a total of $200,000 in late 2017 and into early 2018.  
That company, Essential Consultants, was created by Cohen in October 2016 and soon after 
was used to make a $130,000 hush-money payment to Daniels. 
In a prepared statement to CNBC, AT&T said Cohen's company was one of several firms 
we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration. 
They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017, 
AT&T said. 
The company did not say how much it had paid Cohen, who was the president's personal 
lawyer at the time. 
AT&T is in the midst of pursuing an $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. The U.S. 
Justice Department has sued to block that deal. 
In a report on Cohen's company, Avenatti's law firm said that Novartis in late 2017 and early 
2018 made four separate payments to Essential Consultants totaling nearly $400,000. 
Following these payments, reports surfaced that Mr. Trump took a dinner with the 
incoming CEO of Novartis before Mr. Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in 
Davos, Switzerland in late January 2018, Avenatti's report said. 
That CEO, Vas Narasimhan, was joined with a group of other companies' executives at that  
dinner.  
A Novartis spokesperson said in a statement that any agreements with Essential Consultants 
were entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have 
expired. 
Avenatti's report says another company, Korea Aerospace Industries LTD, paid Essential 
Consultants $150,000 in November 2017. 
Avenatti's client Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 by 
Essential Consultants on the eve of the 2016 presidential election. 
Daniels says the money was in exchange for her signing a deal that required her to remain 
silent about an affair she claims to have had with Trump in 2006, shortly after the birth of 
his youngest son. 
The White House has denied that Trump had sex with the adult film actress. 
Neither the White House nor Cohen had an immediate comment on Avenatti's new 
allegations about payments to Cohen's company.

specifically about your work, Breitbart is very close to the tea party movement. So I’m just
wondering whether you could tell me about if in the current flow of contemporary politics
— first tell us a little bit about Breitbart, what the mission is, and then tell me about the
reach that you have and then could you say a little bit about the current dynamic of what’s
going on at the moment in the States.

Bannon: Outside of Fox News and the Drudge Report, we’re the third-largest
conservative news site and, quite frankly, we have a bigger global reach than even Fox.
And that’s why we’re expanding so much internationally.

Look, we believe — strongly — that there is a global tea party movement. We've seen that.
We were the first group to get in and start reporting on things like UKIP and Front
National and other center right. With all the baggage that those groups bring — and trust
me, a lot of them bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and racially — but we think that
will all be worked through with time.

The central thing that binds that all together is a center-right populist movement of really
the middle class, the working men and women in the world who are just tired of being
dictated to by what we call the party of Davos. A group of kind of — we’re not conspiracy-
theory guys, but there’s certainly — and I could see this when I worked at Goldman Sachs
— there are people in New York that feel closer to people in London and in Berlin than
they do to people in Kansas and in Colorado, and they have more of this elite mentality
that they’re going to dictate to everybody how the world’s going to be run.

I will tell you that the working men and women of Europe and Asia and the United States
and Latin America don’t believe that. They believe they know what’s best for how they will
comport their lives. They think they know best about how to raise their families and how
to educate their families. So I think you're seeing a global reaction to centralized
government, whether that government is in Beijing or that government is in Washington,

DC, or that government is in Brussels. So we are the platform for the voice of that.

“Putin’s ... very, very very intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he’s
playing very strongly to social conservatives about his message about more traditional
values, so I think it’s something that we have to be very much on guard of.”

up in our unconscious. Unfortunately, the unsettling feelings that many will have to these studies are
exacerbated by an additional set of results collected by Eberhardt, linking unconscious impressions to
harmful actions. Caucasian male subjects watched a video of a policeman using force to subdue a suspect
who was either Black or Caucasian. When primed with an ape drawing, but not that of a tiger, subjects
were more likely to say that the policeman was justified in subduing the Black suspect than the Caucasian
suspect. We are more than closet racists. We are out of the closet, armed for prejudice and
dehumanization.

To unconsciously think that Blacks are more like apes than other racial groups is to strip them of
characteristics that are uniquely human. As Haslam notes, when we dehumanize others in this particular
way, we no longer see them as human, but as incompetent wild animals or immature children lacking in
intelligence, etiquette, rationality, and moral wherewithal. This mode of dehumanization is ancient,
reflected in the writings and paintings of European explorers who encountered indigenous cultures in
Asia, Australia, and Africa. Dehumanizing others into objects is equally ancient, unflattering and
dangerous. In one study, American adults were told to focus on either the physical appearance or
personality of the actress Angelina Jolie and the ex-governor of Alaska and presidential hopeful Sarah
Palin — both famous personalities within the United States. When subjects focused on appearance as
opposed to personality, they judged both Jolie and Palin as relatively lacking in traits of experience or
human nature. Jolie and Palin were seen as objects. In other studies, carried out by Haslam, subjects
judged objectified men and women as less capable of suffering and less deserving of moral compassion
and protection, reinforcing the age old attitude we once held toward slaves, and that many hold today
toward prostitutes. When people become property, they fall outside of the circle of moral patients. Studies
of the brain provide further support for these dehumanizing transformations, and highlight, once again,

both the beneficial and malignant consequences of our mind’s promiscuity.

of Justice charged with corruption; and Suleyman Kerimov, a civil servant from Dagestan, who
had amassed an estimated fortune of $7.1 billion. Kerimov recently had been charged for
manipulating a Potash cartel case in Belarus. Most of these clients were reputed to be part of
Putin’s inner circle.

To break the ice, I asked him about Oliver Stone. I knew he had a small role in Oliver Stone’s
forthcoming movie “Snowden.” in which he plays Snowden’s lawyer in Moscow.

“T was impressed by how few takes he needed to shoot my scene,” he answered.
“How did you come to be Snowden’s lawyer?” I asked.

“Snowden picked me from a roster of 15 lawyers with which he had been given.” He then went
to Sheremetyevo International Airport to meet his new client. They met on the morning of Friday
July 12, 2013. At that point, he said that Snowden had been held virtually incommunicado for 20
days. Other than Russian officials, the only person he had been allowed to see during this period
was Assange’s aide, Sarah Harrison.

“Where in the airport did you meet him?” I asked. Was it in a VIP lounge?”

“Tt was in the transit zone,” he replied coyly. “That is all I can say.” They spoke through a
translator, as Snowden did not speak Russian. By this time, Sarah Harrison had sent 21 countries
petitions for asylum that were signed by Snowden. Whatever their purpose, Kucherena did not
consider them helpful. “I told him that if he wanted to get sanctuary in Russia, he would have to
immediately withdraw all the petitions in which he had asked other countries for asylum.”
Kucherena said that otherwise he could not represent him. Snowden agreed to that condition.

Later that afternoon Kucherena accompanied Snowden to area G9 in the transit zone where
they emerged from a door marked “authorized personnel only” shortly before 5 PM. The room
was packed with representatives of Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Wikileaks and
other Moscow-based activist groups. They had been invited the previous day by an emails signed
“Edward Snowden” instructing then to go to Terminal F at Sheremetyevo International Airport
where they would be met by airport personnel carrying a “G9.” It was a rare, if not
unprecedented, event, for an American citizen to defect to Russia.

Wearing an open-neck blue shirt and badly-creased jacket, Snowden read a prepared statement
that accused the United States government of violating the universal declaration of human rights
and described himself as a victim of political persecution. | He then formally announced that he
was “requesting asylum in Russia.”

In discussing this meeting, Kucherena told me that Snowden had not intended to seek asylum
in Russia when he arrived on June 23. Since he also said he had not met Snowden prior to July
12, I asked how he knew Snowden’s intentions.

evaluating both present cost and present value is our time preference rate now,
rather than some retrospective or prospective average, might seem counterintuitive.

I propose it, even so, as the “time discount rule”.

Analogy to the Firm

I follow convention by treating all transfer out as compensated by actual or imputed
revenue. The part exhausted in taste satisfaction gets imputed revenue paid by the
consumer satisfied. Not all revenue compensates transfer out, as revenue is usually
defined as sales proceeds against which prior outside claims must be satisfied first.
These are typically for labor and supplies in the case of the firm. Chapter 6 gave the

logic in word equations. It begins with

P-P.=P.» (A3.1)

where p isrevenue, p. is prior claims and p, is “earned revenue” as a residual.

Earned revenue, also called gross realized output, is thus remaining share of overall
revenue earned by the firm or other entity that performed the sales, collected the

proceeds, and paid the outside claims on them.

What the the firm or other contributor gives up to earn the earned revenue is the
sum of its realized output Xs and its recovered decapitalization D,. Remember

from (A1.4) that D, includes any pure consumption realized by the owner of the

source asset, although that could not apply where the owner is taken as a firm. The
sum of Y, and D, gives its gross realized output. Then

Y gross=p,=Y,+D,, (A3.2)

where Y gross is gross realized output. In Chapter 6, I also called Y gross or p,

“gross positive cash flow”. All mean the same. | will usually leave out the notation

£6m worth of Picassos to go on show during Frieze

The exhibition, to be held in a property co-owned by a Russian billionaire, also includes works by Warhol, Hirst,
Richter and Saatchi's New Sensations

By Gareth Harris | Web only
Published online 9 Sep 10 (News)

Four rare works by Picasso thought to be worth over £6m and an 1875 Cézanne oil on canvas will go on sale
during Frieze week next month in an ambitious exhibition to be held at a London property part owned by a
Russian billionaire. The show, entitled The House of the Noble Man (12-20 October), will open at 2 Cornwall
Terrace, an 18th-century building off Regent's Park in London near to the Frieze Art Fair site. The exhibition is
curated by artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, whose works will feature in the display, and Russian curator Victoria
Golembiovskaya. Around £20m worth of art will be for sale, approximately a third of the show, confirms Von
Lenkiewicz.

According to the co-curator, the Picasso pieces on offer will include Buste d'Homme a Ia Pipe (1969, priced at
£3m); the 1905 drawing The Family of Saltimbanques and a cubist painting, Nature Morte au Gobelet (around
1914). An 1875 oil on canvas by Cézanne, Don Quixote, is priced at £1.25m. Works by Yves Klein, Egon Schiele,
Gerhard Richter, Damien Hirst and Andy Warhol will also be for sale. Von Lenkiewicz's own works will be in the
£30,000-£60,000 price range.

The Picassos etc. are from anonymous dealers who will take their portion of the percentages. Any other
proceeds made during the show will go back into the funding of the exhibition which is hugely expensive despite
its sponsorship [by the Russian real estate company Mirax], adds Von Lenkiewicz. A selection of works from
Charles Saatchi's New Sensations 2010 roster of emerging artists will also be for sale. Twenty students
shortlisted for the prize, which is sponsored by Cadogan Tate, have been chosen to present their work; these
artists include Matthew Welch, Katie Sims and Pablo Wendel. A non-selling section will include works from the
London-based Zabludowicz Collection and the holdings of the Iraqi-born industrialist Ragdan El-akabi.

The show came about when | was in Moscow exhibiting my work at Triumph Gallery. Victoria took me to the
Mirax city project, a huge development in central Moscow. She talked to Sergei Polonsky [head of Mirax] about

the Cornwall Terrace buildings which he has shares in. He was willing to sponsor the show, says Von Lenkiewicz.
The Mirax group are co-developers of the Cornwall Terrace historical complex, parts of which are up for sale.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018281.txt,"be willing to act.”© This is as true for nations as it is for each of us. We must be
willing to act. It’s easy to be sympathetic to the desire for less action. Nothing we’ve
done in recent years seems to be working. But, as we'll see, that’s because we've
been using the wrong tools. Our enemies? They are developing the right ones. They
are willing, and eager, to act. To travel the world now is to encounter in nearly every
capital figures who have a different reading of history or the future of the global
order. They see the world not as some ready-to-eat American political order but
rather as a churning, uncertain, urgently worrying vortex. They wonder: What might
we build? They look at America’s global leadership with the hungry eyes of an
Internet startup eyeing an old, unconnected market. “Don’t do stupid things,” is an
invitation for these forces to poke at the world, to take risks, and to remind us that
so much of what later seems brilliant appears stupid or insane when it begins.

In the years since “smart power” became fashionable, another proposition has
emerged from a different group of elite thinkers. It is, in a sense, the flipside of that
strategy-free posture of passivity. It was distilled by a well-regarded cluster of
academic foreign policy specialists in 2012 as America began withdrawing from
Iraq: “Don’t Come Home America!” they called their essay. As they explained, “The
United States’ globe-girding grand strategy is the devil we know. A world with a
disengaged United States is the devil we don’t know.”®? According to this logic, the
country’s globe-striding posture, while expensive and exhausting and admittedly
inefficient, is a crucial element of our rich national power. Yes, we spend 15% of our
GDP on security activities, but we reap far more in return: Access to the best minds
in the world, a secure life, a culture of open debate and personal liberty.

The problem here is that “Don’t Go Home!” feels, for the most part, like a costly
groping after something to hold onto. Articles and speeches and policy ideas that
flow from this hopeful camp have a shimmering and expensive unreality, one that
American domestic sentiment would be unlikely to support for long and that jostles
against our experience of recent years. Are more aircraft carriers, overseas bases
and jet fighters really the cure for the dangers we face? The ideas of this group have
an appealing simplicity, or maybe I should say an appealing familiarity, because they
echo instincts about power that were once true. The energetic engagement with the
world they suggest is attractive, but America has work to do at home and - we can
all see - the ambitious overseas tasks of recent decades have not, in any event, been
really finished. Instead of a confident, conclusive, “Job well done!” comfort we still
sweat with nervousness. What is coming next? After all the blood and treasure, after
850,000 soldiers in Afghanistan and $3 trillion dollars - we were left with expanded
swamps. Like “Don't do stupid things”, “Don’t Go Home!” tells us little about the
picture of world order that might emerge in the future. (It also tips us to this:
Probably as a general rule no credible grand strategy starts with the word “Don’t”.)

processes discussed above. Second, students could choose to think
about diagnosis in some areas as opposed to others. Art experts might
teach about art fraud, and lawyers might teach about detecting busi-
ness fraud. In each case there would be similarities, and these should
be taught by a group of faculty from different areas, but at the end
of the course students should be able to start to actually do diagnosis
under the tutelage of an expert in an area that interests them.

They actually may not know much about that area of knowledge,
of course, and that would be the objection of the faculty to this idea.
But it is my contention that faculty have had this wrong all these
years. Teaching the basics to students, who have no concept of their
possible use, is really not helpful. All these introductory courses are
just an excuse to pack kids into lecture halls and pretend to do educa-
tion while saving money on hiring more teachers. Teachers should
pose real-world problems to students and encourage students to gain
the knowledge they need to solve them.

Diagnosis is a perfect area for this. One can try one’s hand at
crime detection, without knowing everything about the details of
how one does it, with the help of an expert looking over one’s shoul-
der. This kind of just-in-time learning is how humans have always
learned what they needed to know. The idea that school should teach
you what you need to know before you need to know it, is seriously
flawed. People can’t remember what they learned, years after they
learned it in school, if they haven’t been practicing what they learned
all along.

Judgment. Law typically is not part of any college curriculum
because law schools are recent inventions on college campuses (that is,
they are from the past century and not the century before) so law never
got to be part of the required or even elective set of college courses
despite the fact that so many students want to be lawyers. Judges make
judgments all the time, and those lawyers who teach judges to make
judgments should be teaching freshmen to make judgments as well.
Of course, artists and musicians and literary critics make judgments
of a different sort, as do philosophers and businesspeople. All of these
people could be teaching a course together on how to make judgments
fairly and how to determine what is fair. This is where ethics and
morality come into play as well.

One might consider...

e Options for reducing expenses by focusing on entitlement reform and operating efficiency
— Formula changes could help Social Security's underfunding, but look too draconian for Medicare/Medicaid;
the underlying healthcare cost dilemma requires business process restructuring and realigned incentives.
- Resuming the 20-year trend line for lower Federal civilian employment, plus more flexible compensation
systems and selective local outsourcing, could help streamline USA Inc.’s operations.

e Options for increasing revenue by focusing on driving long-term GDP growth and changing tax

policies

- USA Inc. should examine ways to invest in growth that provides a high return (ROI) via new investment in
technology, education, and infrastructure and could stimulate productivity gains and employment growth.

— Reducing tax subsidies (like exemptions on mortgage interest payments or healthcare benefits) and
changing the tax system in other ways could increase USA Inc.’s revenue without raising income taxes to
punitive — and self-defeating — levels. Such tax policy changes could help re-balance USA’s economy
between consumption and savings and re-orient business lines towards investment-led growth, though
there are potential risks and drawbacks.

e History suggests the long-term consequences of inaction could be severe
- USA Inc. has many assets, but it must start addressing its spending/debt challenges now.

Sizing Costs Related to USA Inc.’s Key Financial Challenges

& Potential AND / OR Solutions

e To create frameworks for discussion, the next slide summarizes USA Inc.’s various
financial challenges and the projected future cost of each main expense driver.

— The estimated future cost is calculated as the net present value of expected
‘dedicated’ future income (such as payroll taxes) minus expected future expenses
(such as benefits paid) over the next 75 years.

e Then we ask the question: ‘What can we do to solve these financial challenges?’

— The potential solutions include a range of simple mathematical illustrations (such as
changing program characteristics or increasing tax rates) and/or program-specific
policy solutions proposed or considered by lawmakers and agencies like the CBO
(such as indexing Social Security initial benefits to growth in cost of living).

e These mathematical illustrations are only a mechanical answer to key financial
challenges and not realistic solutions. In reality, a combination of detailed policy
changes will likely be required to bridge the future funding gap.

Trump’s Saudi Arms Sale Is About Politics and
Economics, Not Security
by Mitchell Bard

President Trump wants to use his emergency
powers to sell billions of dollars’ worth of
weapons to Saudi Arabia on national security
grounds. Congress wants to stop the sale
because of lingering anger over Saudi abuses
and the murder of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi, and the usurpation of its legal
authority to review arms sales. Both sides are
ingenuous. The willingness to sell the Saudis - i
weapons has little to do with American national security, and
everything to do with economics and politics.

wilderness mirrored the wider exclusion felt by the Sephardim. The last election
he had lost, in December 1973, proved too soon for the earth to part. But he told
his supporters: “Even though Labour has won these elections, after something
like the Yom Kippur War happens to a country, and to a government, they must
lose power. They wi// lose power.” He was right. Only twice in the four decades
that followed would a Labor leader defeat Begin’s Likud party: Rabin’s election
victory in 1992, and mine over Bibi Netanyahu in 1999.

During the first two years of Begin’s rule, however, I was 7,000 miles away.
Ten days before the election, I’d gone to see Motta, and he’d agreed that I could
return to Stanford, to finish what I’d barely begun when the 1973 war broke out.
I had been in the army, with the one hiatus as a sayeret reservist at Hebrew
University, since the age of seventeen. I did not regret committing myself to a
life in uniform. But Stanford offered an extraordinary opportunity to broaden
my horizons. Even in the few weeks I’d spent there before the war, I'd felt
reinvigorated. It engaged a different kind of intelligence, a different part of who
I was: the books, the professors. A chance to listen to, and at least try to play,
beautiful music. And to spend more than a few stolen evenings or weekends
with my family.

The timing had nothing to do with the election. Like most other Labor
Israelis, and many of Begin’s own supporters, I hadn’t expected the Likud to
win. It was because I felt I'd reached a natural punctuation mark in my military
career. I’d led Sayeret Matkal. I’d commanded a tank company, a battalion in
1973, and, more briefly than I’d hoped, the 401° Brigade after the war. I’d spent
the last two years in the kirva. The next step up the command chain would be to
lead a full armored division. But at age 35, I was probably too young, and I
figured I’d have a far better chance in two years’ time. I also feared losing the
chance to go to Stanford altogether. Motta’s term as chief of staff would end the
following year. Among those in the frame to succeed him was Raful Eitan.
Recalling Raful’s dismissive, almost sneering, opposition to my making the
Sayeret Matkal into Israel’s SAS, I wasn’t exactly confident I could count on
his support.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029928.txt,"beginning I kept having this nagging
thought: what is so bad about getting
better from a placebo?”

That kind of thinking, still hard for
most doctors to accept, was heretical in
1990, when Kaptchuk arrived at Har-
vard. “People kept saying, ‘Oh, this is just
the placebo effect” You would hear that
every day,” Kaptchuk said. He had spent
years studying Chinese medicine (and
medical history), and this made no sense
to him. “I thought, Ted, step back a
minute. This wasn’t just something that
was a negative. It was something that
needed to be understood.”

Slowly, over the past decade, re-
searchers have begun to tease out the
strands of the placebo response. The
findings, while difficult to translate into
medicine, have been compelling. In most
cases, the larger the pill, the stronger the
placebo effect. Two pills are better than
one, and brand-name pills trump gener-
ics. Capsules are generally more effective
than pills, and injections produce a more
pronounced effect than either. There is
even evidence to suggest that the color of
medicine influences the way one re-
sponds to it: colored pills are more likely
to relieve pain than white pills; blue pills
help people sleep better than red pills;
and green capsules are the best bet when
it comes to anxiety medication.

Conditioning and expectations mat-
ter, and so does learned behavior. In the
eighties, Levine and Gordon divided a
group of postoperative patients into three
sections: those in the first section re-
ceived morphine secretly, those in the
second were told they would receive
morphine (and did), and those in the
third were given a placebo that was de-
scribed as a powerful pain reliever. The
results were startling. Patients who were
told that they would receive a painkiller,
whether they actually received it or not,
had the same experience in the trial as
those who secretly received between six
and eight milligrams of morphine—a
significant amount. The covert dose had
to be increased to twelve milligrams to
surpass the effect of the placebo. Over
the past two decades, the Italian neuro-
scientist Fabrizio Benedetti (who studied
with Gordon and Levine), and Luana
Colloca, a colleague of Benedetti’s, who
is now based in the United States, at
the National Institutes of Health, have
expanded on these studies. They have

found, for example, that diazepam—
more commonly known as Valium—has
no discernible effect on anxiety unless a
person knows he is taking it. And, in-
creasingly, studies like those have been
carried out with the help of imaging
techniques—such as PET scans and func-
tional M.R.I.s—that can track brain
changes as they happen. These advances
in brain imaging, along with an increased
understanding of neurochemicals, have
transformed a vague and mysterious no-
tion into a tangible effect that scientists
consider worthy of investigation.

“What's exciting here is that, ifwe are
to talk about using placebos in a clinical
setting, they would have to have a mea-
surable effect and a biology we under-
stand,” Wayne Jonas told me. Jonas is an
interesting hybrid in a world often
sharply divided between conventional
and alternative therapies. In the early
nineties, he served as the director of the
Medical Research Fellowship Program
at the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research, in Washington, D.C. He went
on to run the Office of Alternative Med-
icine at the National Institutes of Health,
from 1995 to 1999. Today, Jonas is the
president of the Samueli Institute, a
Washington research group devoted to
shifting the focus of health care from
treatment to prevention.

“The morphine studies bring us a long
way,” he said. So did a recent investiga-
tion by Kaptchuk, in which participants

suffering from irritable-bowel syndrome
were not deceived about their treatment;
in fact, they were told in great detail about
the placebos they received and that they
were often as effective as real medicine.
The pills brought them relief.

For many people in the field, results
like those achieved in the morphine and
I.B.S. studies, while preliminary and in
need of confirmation, hint at something
far more significant than the effect of a
placebo or problems with a particular
drug. They suggest that the “magic bullet”
approach to health care—simple, effective
solutions to single problems, like a strep
infection or polio—can no longer remain
our principal approach to treating disease.

There has always been a distinction
between disease and illness. Disease is a
biological condition that we have histor-
ically treated with drugs, surgery, and
other technological solutions. Illness, on
the other hand, defines the context of a
medical encounter, including the rela-
tionship between doctor and patient.
Like Kaptchuk, Jonas believes that pla-
cebo research demonstrates that it is es-
sential to consider both the science and
the art of medicine—to think about dis-
eases as illnesses, and not to rely solely on
short-term, high-tech solutions. Scien-
tists hope that, even if it proves impossi-
ble to replace drugs with placebos, re-
search into the way they affect us will
accomplish nothing less than a transfor-
mation of American medicine. “There are

I wrote this email for your review, if you think its worth sending, please critique, and let me know,. thank you: 
Mr. Tarek El Sayed, 
I hope this email finds you well, and believe worth communicating my thoughts to you. 
I was surprised to hear that you decided against the purchase of our Super Boeing 727. I personally thought it was a great match for 
your business needs in Qatar. If for any reason your decision was based on crew issues and charter needs in the Middle East, I'd like 
to share some information that might prove beneficial to making you reconsider this purchase. 
The pilot candidates I have lined up for your interview along with the possibility of David Rodgers joining your flight department 
were as follows: 
(at no time did I disclose location or persons to the following pilot candidates to protect your privacy.) 
Robert Breslin, who is the former Chief Pilot of Mr. Donald Trump, Mr. Breslin flew the Boeing 727 and Boeing 757 owned by Mr 
Trump. Mr Breslin is a fine man of 40 years of age estimate, with extensive VIP Boeing operations. 
James Bartakowski, who has extensive flying experience in the Middle east, Africa and Europe regime. Mr. Bartakowski has also 
been involved in charter operations in Africa and Middle East and has contacted me on several recent occasions with charters for 
our Boeing 727, James has indicated there is the possibility of 40 — 60 hours per month charter operations for larger transport 
category aircraft in your area. I believe there is a growing need for charter in the business community in Qatar and neighboring 
countries. 
Bruce Jafahri, who is a current Boeing 727 captain who lived in Doha for two years, and familiar with international operations of 
Boeing 727 aircraft. Mr. Jafahri currently lives in California and ready for a new opportunity. Bruce is current in the Boeing 727 and 
also flew Captain on the Boeing 747. Well qualified individual and personable. 
Mr. El Sayed, as you have seen during our demo flight, our Boeing 727 is in impeccable condition, quite cabin and will provide many 
years of charter and business flights your company. I believe the large business jet future in Qatar is growing and you will be leading 
its path, and your initial investment in this purchase will not come close with other aircraft options on the market as you may have 
seen already. 
We are currently completing the C2C check on the Boeing, and as we have done in the past, assure you it will be a fine aircraft 
when it leaves Flight Star Maintenance repair facility.

I did regret being unable to rely on the support of two key constituencies that
had helped deliver my landslide victory barely 18 months earlier: my own Labor
Party and the Arab citizens of Israel. I had no trouble understanding the reasons
many Israeli Arabs were abandoning me. The clashes in the Galilee at the start of
the new intifada had left more than a dozen of their community dead. As an official
inquiry would later conclude, there was blame on all sides. A number of Arab
members of the Knesset had played a part in inciting the violence. Yet the police
had been unprepared, and they had used excessive force. As I said publicly before
the election, I, as Prime Minister, was ultimately responsible, and I formally
apologized for what had happened. Yet the roots went deeper, to the economic and
social disadvantages still faced by many Arab citizens, and the difficulty in
resolving those problems calmly and collectively as long as Israel remained in a
state of war with its Arab neighbors.

For Labor and the political left, it was as if, despite Arafat’s repeated rejections
of ever more forthcoming terms of peace, they still couldn’t bring themselves to
believe he really meant it. By default, they were inclined to blame me for not
delivering peace. I was accused of relying too much on a close circle of aides and
negotiators I’d known from my time in the army, of not giving a negotiating role to
Labor veterans of the Oslo negotiations like Yossi Beilin, and of being
insufficiently sensitive to Arafat’s needs in the negotiating process. Typical of the
argument was a broadside by the journalist and historian Tom Segev, in Haaretz,
which accused me of an “incredible arrogance” which had “led to an historic
mistake. Rather than continue on the Oslo road, Barak put it into his head that he
could reach a final settlement and try and impose it on the Palestinian Authority
President.” I did not try to “impose” anything on Arafat. I did, quite consciously,
abandon the “Oslo road” because it was inexorably leading to a situation where,
after the final Wye redeployments, Arafat would have control over the great
majority of the West Bank without having to commit to any of the assurances that
even most on the Israeli left would define as the minimum required for peace.
Now, of course, we knew that was something the Palestinian leader was not
prepared to do.

When election day came, not that many of my critics on the left actually voted
against me. Nor did the Israeli Arabs. Yet in very large numbers, they simply
didn’t vote. In percentage terms, Arik’s victory was even more decisive than mine
over Bibi. He got more than 62 percent of the vote. I received barely 37 percent.

Disgusting: Clinton Snared In Pedophile Ring 
Will having friends in high places exempt him from the rule of law? 
Kris Zane — March 27, 2014  
According to former child sex slave Virginia Roberts and a class action lawsuit against convicted billionaire 
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, former President Bill Clinton was present during sex parties involving up to twenty 
underage girls at Epstein's secluded island in the Caribbean. That flight records show Clinton was flown on 
numerous occasions to the island on Epstein's private jet. Clinton had a close relationship with an employee of 
Epstein's who compiled thousands of photos of nude young girls posed in lewd positions. And these photos 
were used as a catalog for Epstein to loan out his girls to powerful politicians and British royalty, including Bill 
Clinton. 
According to the lawsuit:  
Advertisement-content continues below 
...Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who kept images of naked underage children on her computer, 
helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed underage females in sexually explicit 
poses. 
While Epstein was indicted and jailed for his pedophilia, Bill Clinton oddly has remained unscathed, more than 
likely by having friends in high places. 
If Bill Clinton is in fact a pedophile, will the American people demand that he be put away for a very long time 
so that he can't hurt any more children? Or will having friends in high places exempt him from the rule of law? 
Time will tell.

And when she faces our creator... Google 'Clinton Body Count and see the list of people that they are 
responsible for having killed... She has so many people that are stupid enough to do her bidding in murder. Do 
they now know that murder carries a sentence of HELL in the eyes of God.. That is right they do not believe in

Nancy, you are so right and it is time now to take back the Peoples White House and don't let this trash back in. 
We have had enough with obama trashing our Great Nation AND THE WHITE HOUSE. I suspect very soon he 
will have us in a War. Neither Hillary the dike or obama respects our service men and they should both be put 
in jail for how they handled our men in that ugly country. God Bless America As We Knew It and In God We 
trust. NO MORE DEMORATS OR GAYS FOR PRESIDENT.

Years ago, I watched as the Dirty Old Men of the Panamanian government picked up their little blonde

I have a feeling that if anyone really investigates the crop of liberal Hypocrats in power today, they would find 
who were the real Dirty Old Men of the party.

They do not call him slick willy for nothing. Short of an actual photograph or video of him engaging in sex 
with a child there is no way he will get this pinned on him. Just remember how many people (40-50) connected 
to him and her that have lost their lives (murdered) and he's never been prosecuted. 
As much as I would like to see him and his carpet munching wife brought down it is just not going to happen, at

This self proved scumbag was impeached as President but got off and he will this time too. The left has so 
utterly turned us into a valueless and degenerate society and is determined to destroy what little of decency is 
left that he will NEVER be held either responsible or accountable for his sins. We have a criminally complicit 
Congress which has allowed the rule of law to cease to matter and when the time comes when they NEED it for 
their OWN SELF PRESERVATION, it will not be available even to them. As they have sown, so shall they 
reap! Between them, The Clintons are the perfect example of what is wrong with the Country at large and one 
of the major reasons we are now stuck with one worse and a set of political parasites who enable HIM to barter 
our freedoms, sovereignty and resources to our enemies. We have a word for those. You all know what it is but 
few in this country call them what they are, not only violators of their sworn oaths of Office but: TRAITORS. 
This one also happens to be apparently, according to this reference, a pedophile. will wonders never Cease or 
for that matter, CEASE TO DISGUST?

Gee, maybe after 0Buttbreath leaves office, evidence will come out of his visit to HOMOsexual bath houses, 
HOMOsexual rendezvous and relationships and dare I say? Evidence of pedophilia with underage boys. 
0Buttbreath has made many enemies as has his wife and the Clintons both. A bit coincidental that the last two

If this is true then it is truly disgusting. That being said, after reading the comments section most of you need to 
get off of your republican high horse. Many republican politricksters have also been embroiled in sex scandals, 
some of them with minors, and some with underage boys. Now before the vains start popping out of your neck 
causing you to respond to me in all caps calling some sort of commie democrat leftist, realize that I hate the 
democrats just as much as I hate the republicans. In fact let's just call them the demublicans or the republicrats, 
whatever your pleasure. Most of you need to realize it's not about the ideology of one party or the other, it's 
about the ideology of power. These politricksters, all of them more stinking rich than average Joe American, get 
in the insulated world of political power and get a sense of invincibility and entitlement. They don't care about 
you or me, not a single one of them. But, as long as we keep seeing each other as the enemy rather than realize 
that they are the real enemy bent on destroying this country and the world then we, our children, and our 
grandchildren are doomed. 
Below is a link to federal sex scandals perpetrated by republicrats and demublicans alike. Keep in mind that this 
list does not include local and state level scandals.

Bill Clinton has had a sexual problem for his entire life. People like the Clintons, Obamas, Bidens, Reids, 
Schumers, Boehners, Bushs, etc. can willingly, knowingly, & intentionally commit crimes with no recourse. 
The U.S. Supreme Court rules Obamacare is a tax, Most likely will make Hobby Lobby & similar companies do 
what they are morally against, Will likely ultimately rule to enact strict gun control laws if not an outright ban, 
Allow open boarders, & Immigrants. They always rule in the gov'ts favor. Rarely for the citizenship any longer. 
If the Constitution is ever amended and/or rewrote which they are in favor of they need to be given term & 
power limits. They are the Supreme Power of this Nation and have proven to be a bunch of decrepit buffoons.

White Hoer House in DC, he had a B.J. with Monica Under the Desk in the Oval Office when he was 
impeached, but the Nat See Senate would not convict the Pedophile mur-derer of Vince Foster. 
But we see with the new charges coming against the Felon, Hairy Reid, who takes Bribes and Steals as the

All DemoFascistCrats are Lawless and EVIL.

This kind of evil is what kept Romney out of office, for the time being. Obama did not win the vote, he was 
placed in by the same people who protect Clinton in his evil sin. Of course he should be in prison, but he won't 
see a day in prison as long as righteous people don't stand up to evil.

The girls listed here (well not here, in an article longer than a twitter post) are of age in every European country, 
and Canada. Just like age of drinking, you guys are the anomaly with a higher degree of repression in all social 
areas. 
The reason for that is the crazy -ass, hate spewing, xenophobic, ignorant political bandwagons and scape-
goating your society is rife with. Right now you're trying to figure out how you can blame this on Obama aren't 
you? Yeah I know. Obama. His fault. Somehow. (Actually several posts already are) 
That said, yeah he's stupid. He should follow the laws of his own country. If that's your laws he should be 
following them. 
However, nobody here has the slightest friggen idea if any of this is the least bit true, but you're already 
forming the lynch mobs. 
It's not because you're really upset about the issue at hand. It's hatred of your fat and miserable existence, your 
subscription and indoctrination in to disgusting and brutal pseudo-religious political beliefs, and your lazy 
inability to fact check a thing for yourself when you find it so much easier to ride on a bandwagon. 
Search consistency theory, if you can handle all the big words and ideas, and you'll figure out why you are 
unable to learn and grow as people. 
I swear most of you can't create or express an idea without it being ascribed to a political view.

Huh? Wha? I'm figuring you're not an American citizen. You bunched up all into a group that you describe 
with some wonderful words. Maybe YOU know the WHOLE TRUTH, there are plenty who recall how a newly 
elected President had to give MONEY to a couple of women who had been assaulted by this scum bag. Check 
the news papers.......no not twitter.......Maybe you don't know about the White Water scandal or about 
Vince Foster, who shot himself in the RIGHT side of his head; the man must have been so depressed he used 
his off' hand to pull the trigger. Maybe his left hand just shook too much. The Monica escapade was just a 
man having a fling with a silly woman, makes no mind the woman was the same age as his daughter. HE LIED 
UNDER OATH TO A FEDERAL JUDGE. He stood in front of the entire country and stated he did not have 
sex with that woman. As for political view points.......isn't that how governments are elected? I don't know 
what country you live in, but here we like to THINK before voting, OOPS! I mean generally; right now there 
are too damn many NON thinking casting ballots. That's how we got slick and now Obummer.

Well, your post just proved my point about not being able to base an idea independent from a political view. 
About categorizing a populace: anyone intelligent enough to think for themselves isn't going to need me to 
validate their self-worth, and realises within themselves that this label doesn't apply to them.

I find the funniest thing is the word Choice has been taken over by the pro-abortion mob, and the stupid 
people of the former united States don't have any choice, anymore, period. 
If we had a smidgen of Choice anymore, the Clintons would be whining about getting paroled from their 
original prison sentences for wasting Vince Foster — on, get this, humanitarian grounds. 
We have no choice. All you have to do is open your eyes and you'll see that we're still nothing but the serfs 
who pay for the daily antics of the lords. Nothing has changed.

I'm not surprised that a proven serial-rapist, murderer and drug trafficker would also be a pedophile. The leader 
of the administration before his, yes that guy, was also linked to a pedophile prostitution ring uncovered in the 
Franklin pedophile investigation. Research it; and also the name Johnny Gosh. It's a fascinating true story.

The clintons are just evil vial people and I am not surprised about this at all. Also there was a comment asking 
about the ages of those girls involved? Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who kept images of 
naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed 
underage females in sexually explicit poses.

Pretty much covers that they were in fact underage children. Makes me sick to my stomach and would love to

Subject: Filing in Epstein case 
Hi Prof. Dershowitz: 
I've been following the Jeffrey Epstein litigation saga on and off for some time. 
When I checked the federal court docket last night, I came across the attached filing. It makes some serious 
allegations about you and several other people related to the case. 
I wanted to make sure you had a copy of the filing and to ask if you have any comments on the allegations 
raised in it. 
I'm planning to write a blog entry or story on this and will probably do so fairly soon since the filing is a 
public record at this point. 
Anyway, if you want to respond, please let me know as soon as possible. 
Thanks

103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *864

Public prosecutors now dominate enforcement decisions in both common law-based and civil law-based justice systems
worldwide. That is hardly surprising, given the far-reaching regulatory scope of modern criminal law and high expectations that
the state will ensure security against social disorder and innumerable harms, and will intervene in risk creation long before
manifest criminal conduct or injury. © That agenda requires capacity, resources, and expertise that only public agencies can
marshal. Moreover, a criminal enforcement regime that relied heavily on private plaintiffs would be one skewed against redress
for poor victims who cannot bear litigation costs to vindicate their own interests. 7° Without safeguards, such a regime [*865]
also could be at the mercy of the varied, perhaps idiosyncratic motives and interests of private actors lodging criminal
complaints.

Still, many countries continue to authorize private citizens to initiate criminal prosecutions when public officials do not, and
others allow privately funded attorneys to assist or supplement public prosecutors in litigating criminal cases. Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, and England and Wales all continue to allow private prosecutions, 7! and fifteen of the twenty-eight
member states of the European Union grant victims some comparable [*866] authority. ’* Details vary across jurisdictions,
but everywhere private prosecutors’ authority is limited by oversight from public [*867] prosecutors and courts. ™ The
standard common law model is that public prosecutors retain the power to take over privately filed charges and then either try
the case themselves, negotiate a plea bargain, or - more commonly when intervention occurs - dismiss the charges altogether.
In this framework, private actors can press charges when public officials do not, but functionally they serve primarily as a
mechanism for political accountability. Through private charging in the wake of public prosecutors’ declination, victims force
public officials to justify publicly their reasons for not charging and for vetoing privately filed charges - and to do so on
grounds other than public resource constraints, given that a private actor has offered to bear the costs. Given the private cost
barriers and the capacity of public prosecution agencies, it is unsurprising that, even where permitted, privately initiated

charges nonetheless contribute to a tiny fraction of prosecutions on criminal dockets. “4

U.S. jurisdictions are comparative exceptions; nearly all long ago prohibited privately initiated prosecutions, ‘° even though in

other contexts private actors continue to enforce public law in service of public interests. 7° But private criminal charges were

+7 See Harmon, Policing Reform, supra note 21, at 20-51. Federal funding to state and local enforcement agencies is a more direct example
of supplementing resources. Federal influence over local enforcement policies that comes with such funding is an attenuated version of
enforcement redundancy. Id. at 66.

Department Civil Rights Division's most common reasons for declining prosecution were: weak or insufficient admissible evidence ... ; lack
of evidence of criminal intent; ... and lack of investigative or prosecutorial resources). For a good analysis of how police shootings of

weeks during which they were exposed to the human gaze.”

The feeling of being watched enhances cooperation and so does the ability to watch
others. To try to know what others are doing is a fundamental part of being human. So is fitting
in. The more collectivist the human society, the more important it is to conform and the more
prominent the role of shame.* Shame serves as a warning to adhere to group standards or be
prepared for peer punishment. Many individualistic societies, however, have migrated away from
peer punishment toward a third-party penal system, such as a hired police force, formal
contracts, or trial by jury. Shame has become less relevant in societies where taking the law into
one’s own hands is viewed as a breach of civility.

Perhaps this is why it makes us uncomfortable to contemplate shaming people: Shame
invites the public in on the punishment. Consider the scaffolds, scab lists during union strikes, or
Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter. Or the proposal made by prominent conservative
William F. Buckley Jr. in 1986 to tattoo people with AIDS. These instances of shaming now
seem an affront to individual liberty. Getting rid of shaming seems like a pretty good thing,
especially in regulating individual behavior that does not harm others. In eschewing public
shaming, society has begun to rely more heavily on individual feelings of guilt to enhance
cooperation.

Guilt prevails in many social dilemmas, including one area of my own research:
overfishing. At the root of the problem of overfishing is the human appetite. Wild fish catches

are declining, and many of us seek to avoid the guilt brought on by eating unsustainable seafood.

based on conviction or consistency over time are signals that a candidate does not look
at the benefits of cooperation, this is an indication that the candidate can be trusted in
situations where making the decision that is right for his or her constituency comes at
a large political cost. Consistent with this, opponents take every opportunity to paint
candidates as flip-floppers who cannot be trusted [21]. This argument generalizes outside
of politics to why we respect people who are “principled” over those who are “strategic”.

People intuitively cooperate. That is, when people make decisions rapidly, they are
more likely to cooperate than if they have time to deliberate. Additionally, people who
cooperate make quicker decisions than those who defect [22]. The Social Heuristics Hy-
pothesis offers one explanation for this phenomena: we adopt heuristics to avoid incurring
cognitive costs associated with deliberation [23, 24, 25]. In a world with repeated inter-
actions, it is usually worthwhile to cooperate, so individuals may adopt heuristics such
as “always cooperate” or “cooperate as long a situation is not a business interaction.”
These same individuals, when serving as laboratory subjects, may apply these heuristics
and cooperate even when it is not worthwhile to do so [22, 26].

Our model offers the following alternative explanation for intuitive cooperation. Intu-
itive cooperation may serve to reduce responsiveness to realized costs. Thus, others should
trust intuitive cooperators more than deliberate cooperators. Since intuitive cooperators
are more trustworthy, this may lead people to evolve or learn to become intuitive cooper-
ators. Note that this explanation suggests that intuitive cooperation may be an optimal
response to others’ ability to detect deliberation, and not, as a heuristic is, an attempt
to avoid cognitive costs. For this explanation to be sensible, it must be the case that
whether or not a decision is made intuitively or deliberatively is detectable. In fact, it is:

deliberative decision making leads to slower reaction time, as well as increased pupil size

and Singapore) and into this already wealthy section of southeast Florida.
Approximately 70 hedge and private equity funds are now headquartered
here, many of which have set up shop in the last two years, jacking up home
prices and spurring a countywide initiative to become, as some have said,
“the new Greenwich.”

For hedge fund managers who might normally be inclined toward
Westchester or Connecticut, the allure of South Florida is as plain as grits
on toast. The homes are sprawling; the Intracoastal Waterway is a yachter’s
paradise. It has a glittering social scene. During high season—October
through March—there might be several fundraisers on any given night.
Perhaps the key factor, however: In Florida, there are no individual income
taxes, no estate taxes and no capital gains taxes. A hedge fund manager
reporting $1 million in income can expect to pay only the federal
government, whereas his counterpart living in Connecticut pays that plus an
extra $67,000. And if the poor schmuck were still in New York City? He’d
better be ready to fork over $104,300.

As for why all of this is happening now, when Florida has long been a sunny
tax haven, so to speak, financiers point to the upcoming application of
Section 457A of the Internal Revenue Code. Before 457A was enacted,
certain fees and related earnings could grow tax deferred in offshore
accounts for up to ten years. But now, according to the section, hedge fund
managers will need to funnel all of the fees that were deferred before 2009
and their related earnings back into the U.S. by 2017. If a manager lives in
Florida when this happens, he’s much less likely to pay exorbitant state
taxes on the whole amount. If he still lived in New York City?
Fuggedaboudit.

It’s the job of Kelly Smallridge, president and CEO of the Palm Beach
Business Development Board, to ensure that hedge fund and private equity
managers are informed of these benefits, in the hopes that they, and their
firms, will become Palm Beach County’s newest residents. She’s developed a
red-carpet tour that goes beyond looking at office space and real estate to
include meeting headmasters at private schools, the school-district
superintendent and the mayor and speaking with the governor’s staff and
CEOs who have moved their operations here. Plus, of course, a few nights
on the town.

class I deliberately made a mistake in asking about a case. I asked what the jury instruction had
been. A student sheepishly raised his hand and said, “Professor, there was no jury instruction - -
the case was tried before a judge.” I said, “Woops - - I made a mistake. You’re right,” and I
moved on. I noticed that after that “mistake” the students loosened up and were prepared to take
many more risks. I have repeated this ploy many times to loosen up a class.

Sometimes my mistakes in class were completely unintentional and darn embarrassing. Once I
was teaching about a criminal concept that required the prosecution to build a wall separating
information obtained under grant of immunity from information independently secured through
investigation. The courts described this as a “Chinese Wall” because it had to be impenetrable. I
was raising the possibility that one prosecutor may have improperly leaked information to another
prosecutor, and I described it as follows: “There may have been a chink in the Chinese Wall.” A
Chinese American student in the class immediately took offense, erroneously believing that I was
referring to Chinese people with that racial epithet. The thought had never occurred to me, but I
never used that particular phraseology again.

I also offended some of my Jewish students once when I was comparing Canada’s approach to
affirmative action to our own. In Canada, only “visible minorities” are eligible for affirmative
action. A student asked me whether Jews were a visible minority. I responded, “No, we’re an
audible minority.” Even though I was joking about my own group, I got flack from a number of
Jewish students who thought I was reaffirming an old stereotype. I quickly learned that humor
was important to my teaching but that humor based on racial, gender or religious stereotyping
could raise sensitivities.

I was sympathetic, therefore, when I asked a first year student how we would have responded to
a particular plea bargain offer by a prosecutor. His response: “I would have tried to Jew him
down a bit.” The class was appalled at his ethnic slur and so was I, but I understood that he was
probably just regurgitating what he had heard at his dinner table. I spoke to him privately after
class. He was genuinely mortified at his lack of sensitivity. I’m sure he never repeated that
particular slur.

Because I was a rookie, I tended to spend an enormous number of hours preparing for each class.
I stayed up the night before planning my questions and strategies and got to the law school at
7:00 am before each class. Naturally I parked in the first available slot in the parking lot. Several
days into the semester Professor Clark Byse mentioned at lunch that Dean Griswold was sizzling
mad because someone was taking his parking spot every day. Nobody had told me that the first
spot was traditionally reserved for the Dean.

Erwin Griswold was quite concerned about my lack of sophistication. I had never been outside
the United States when I first started teaching at Harvard. I had barely been out of the Northeast.
I still spoke with a pretty thick Brooklyn accent and, occasionally, allowed Yiddishisms to creep
into my conversation. Griswold decided to take me on as a project. In the spring of my first year,
he told me that he wanted me to go to England and France to look into criminology institutes in
those two countries. The school would pay for the entire trip and various alumni would meet me
in Paris and London and show me around. I was thrilled, but a bit surprised, when I got to Paris
and discovered that there was no criminology institute to speak of. I still had a wonderful time.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013570.txt,"Nonetheless, historical comments about what the classical thermodynamic term,

entropy, is and is not about are in order.

We recall that Richard Feynmann, in his well-known 1962 class notes,
Lectures on Physics, said that the subject of thermodynamics is the study of
relationships among the heat, energetic and organizational properties of materials,
without knowing their internal structure. Historically, the relational formalisms of
equilibrium thermodynamics emerged before our knowledge of the internal structure
of matter. For examples, the pressure in an insulated container of gas is due to
molecular bombardment of the container walls, which increases with heat or
compression of its volume. Compression of its volume increases its temperature
and expansion of its volume leads to cooling. Note that these relationships hold

without specifying the constituents and the specifics of a particular gas or solid.

In his lectures, Feynman’s intuitively accessible examples of reversible
thermodynamic properties are reminiscent of his on camera performance at the
Senatorial hearings about the Challenger disaster. Recall that he dropped an O-ring
in a glass of iced water demonstrating cold-induced rigidification of the rubber ring,
which he postulated to be the cause of the fuel leak and resulting explosion. In his
Lectures, he said that if one holds a rubber band between ones lips as a crude
thermometer, stretching a rubber band heats up the lips and relaxing it cools them.
Working the same system in reverse, and equilibrium thermodynamic systems are
classically reversible, we find that heating a rubber band makes it contract. These
changes involve complicated alterations in the internal arrangements of the
polymeric strands of rubber, their structural properties, the details of which, for the
purpose of global thermodynamic characterization, need not be known. The
relationships between physical state, energy and temperature in this material were
predictable from thermodynamic laws even without specific knowledge of the

complex internal structure and physical dynamics of rubber.

Thermodynamic theory, which makes deep conceptual connections between
quantitatively measurable primitives such as heat, hotness and work and the

invisible in the form of derived ideas such as energy and entropy, yielded an

She and Ross have passion but have never had long-term stability, and the fireworks she
experiences with him but not with Barry might actually turn out to be a liability, given
how many times their relationship has already gone up in flames. It's equally
questionable whether Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw, who cheated on her
kindhearted and generous boyfriend, Aidan, only to end up with the more exciting but
self-absorbed Mr. Big, will be better off in the framework of marriage and family. (Some
time after the breakup, when Carrie ran into Aidan on the street, he was carrying his
infant in a Baby Bjorn. Can anyone imagine Mr. Big walking around with a Bjorn?)

I've never watched Friends or Sex and the City, but I know the feeling.

Personally, I'm more of a novel girl. The other day, I found myself thinking of my long-
ago roommate and her thoughts on arranged marriage while I read Monica Ali's beautiful
book Brick Lane. Monica Ali is an immigrant to the United Kingdom, and the characters
in her novel all come to the UK from Bangladesh. Some of the characters accept
traditional arranged marriages, while others make love marriages instead -- often
defying their parents, their whole set of cultural norms, to do so. Towards the end of the
novel, one man reflects on the early days of his marriage:

We thought that the love would never run out. It was like a magic rice sack that you
could keep scooping into and never get to the bottom. It was a love marriage, you See.
What I did not know -- I was a young man -- is that there are two kinds of love. The kind
that starts off big and slowly wears away, that seems you can never use it up and then
one day is finished. And the kind that you don't notice at first, but which adds a little bit
to itself every day, like an oyster makes a pearl, grain by grain, a jewel from the sand.

As you can tell, this character is currently unhappy in his love marriage.” Of course, the
grass is always greener on the other side. What's the difference between the big love and
the pearl love? Can they even be compared? Is it like apples to oranges?

But couldn't all this be a false dichotomy? Who says it's about arrangement versus
randomness -- chemistry versus choice? Can we have both? Can we find the big love, and
nurture that so it develops into the pearl love, too?

My ultimate conclusion about the Art and Science of Flirting, from my studies of
pickup artists and also my entire life, is that flirting is all about strategic ambiguity.
Deliberate uncertainty. Manipulating ambiguity and uncertainty can contribute to many
intense feelings.

Some people learn this, and decide that the only way to have a relationship with
chemistry is to include a constant generous dollop of uncertainty about love, loyalty, or
something equally important. These people decide chemistry can only derive from little
pieces of confusion: tiny mismatches that lodge underneath the similarities that bring
people together, constantly unsettling, like a prickly burr. But I don't think that's what I
want.

And after all, S&M creates extraordinary feelings too, but plenty of people do S&M in
very controlled circumstances: pre-discussed, with safewords and so on. Arguably, S&M
is another form of mismatch, of contrast, of uncertainty -- but it's a form that can be

believe we live in a Universe where information comes into existence

through the creative endeavors of human beings. When Andrew

Wiles discovered his solution to Fermat’s Last Theorem, he did
something a computer cannot do and demonstrated non-computational
thought. But there is an alternative explanation put forward by the
determined determinists.

Daniel Dennett - the standard bearer for this camp — believes
everything in the Universe is entirely determined. He argues there is no
place in the laws of nature for free will to arise.

Both sides of the argument agree Turing prohibits a general-
purpose machine from solving all mathematical problems, but that
seems to be the extent of agreement. The determinists solve the Wiles
Paradox by arguing he is a special purpose machine, perfectly able to
find answers to non-computable problems. The Turing prohibition only
applies to general purpose machines. Let us run a thought experiment
to see what sort of Universe we would live in if special purpose machines
were the answer to this puzzle.

Ifthe Universe is determined, it can be modeled asa single algorithm.
If everything in the Universe evolves according to a set of rules, it will
run like a giant piece of clockwork or one large computer game. Each
solar system, planet, and individual mathematician would evolve along
preordained lines. Mathematicians would operate as software subroutine
and would rely on further subroutines to explain the beating of their
hearts and the way the molecules of their body interact.

“paradise” in June 2012, shortly before his twenty-ninth birthday.
Just before leaving Annapolis for Hawaii, Mills posted a seminude
picture of herself on her blog, L’s Journey. In it, her face was cov-
ered with a blanket. The caption under it read, “Trying to avoid the
changes coming my way.” In Honolulu, she found “E.,” as she called
Snowden in her blog, “elusive.” She found that he preferred to stay
at home and avoided meeting other people to the point that her
friends “were not quite sure that E. existed.” Lindsay’s fellow per-
formers in the Waikiki Acrobatic Troupe told me in 2016 that they
rarely, if ever, saw Snowden at the practice sessions. Andrew Towl,
a juggler with the group, did briefly meet Snowden once. It was on
a hike with Lindsay in Oahu. Towl said he asked Snowden what he
was doing in Hawaii and Snowden answered tersely, “I work with
computers,” and continued walking. Even though Mills had dated
Snowden for eight years, most of her other friends, except for Jennie
and Joe Chamberlin in Japan, had not met him. Next door neigh-
bors I spoke to caught brief glimpses of him entering or leaving his
house but did not engage him in a conversation as Snowden tended

® to avoid eye contact. If he had other social interactions in Hawaii, no ©
one he met came forward and spoke of meeting him, even after he
became world famous.

Two days after his twenty-ninth birthday dinner on June 21, Mills
described him playfully as a “goof.” She wrote in her blog, “The
universe is telling me something and I’m pretty sure it’s saying get
out, Fuck you Hawaii.” In early July, she summed up her shaky situ-
ation with Snowden in another blog, writing, “I moved to Hawaii
to continue my relationship with E. [but] it has been an emotional
roller coaster since I stepped off the plane.” She diverted herself by
organizing a pole-dancing studio in the four-hundred-square-foot
garage of the house. She also found her own friends in physical fit-
ness and dance groups. She joined a New Age yoga studio called
Physical Phatness, as well as a local acrobatic performance group,
and, on Friday nights, pole danced at the Mercury lounge in down-
town Honolulu. Unlike Snowden, she enjoyed socializing, writing in
her blog, “We lovingly crammed a large group into a small corner
of a delicious Japanese restaurant and filled our bellies with sushi,
tempura, and good conversation.”

eventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West
really have to look at what he’s talking about as far as traditionalism goes — particularly
the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism — and I happen to think
that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think
strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors,
and that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States,
and I think it’s what can see us forward.

You know, Putin’s been quite an interesting character. He’s also very, very, very
intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he’s playing very strongly to social
conservatives about his message about more traditional values, so I think it’s something
that we have to be very much on guard of. Because at the end of the day, I think that Putin
and his cronies are really a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to
expand. However, I really believe that in this current environment, where you're facing a
potential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation — I’m not saying
we can put it on a back burner — but I think we have to deal with first things first.
Questioner: One of my questions has to do with how the West should be responding to
radical Islam. How, specifically, should we as the West respond to Jihadism without
losing our own soul? Because we can win the war and lose ourselves at the same time.
How should the West respond to radical Islam and not lose itself in the process?
Bannon: From a perspective — this may be a little more militant than others. I think
definitely you’re going to need an aspect that is [unintelligible]. I believe you should take
a very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other
aspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive and that’s fine.

If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I
believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think
they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places... It
bequeathed to use the great institution that is the church of the West.

Awards, whilst on the web we have The Webbies. Some prizes,
such as the Nobel Prize, Fields Medal and Pulitzer Prizes, have a long

British government for making a device that allowed ships to determine
their East-West position (a sextant only gives north-south). The 2014

a small history of some of the more famous prizes.

Nobel Prizes

Alfred Nobel spent his life developing weapons and explosives. His
laboratory was built in the middle of a lake with a bridge running to
it, so if he blew himself up doing an experiment, only he would die. He
managed to stabilize nitroglycerine by mixing it with saltpeter and created

One of my exes pointed out my tendency to make out with him while his car was stopped
at traffic lights that were about to turn green. I know! I said. I don't really get why I do
that, myself. He responded, Predicament bondage!”

KK ok

Sometimes, when the pain is getting intense, I'll play a little game with my partners.
(Kind of a game, except it's also serious, or it feels serious at the time; usually, when I
start playing this game, I am not even close to coherent enough to ponder tactics; I'm
running on instinct.) I think of this game as the aren't you scared of the neighbors game.
In the aren't you scared of the neighbors game, I start making noise loud enough that I
might catch outsiders’ attention. Part of me is hoping that my partner is worried about the
neighbors; that he'll relent, that I can use my tiny advantage to convince him to pull back.
That I can play for a moment of relief, a smidgen of mercy.

Of course, if I'm lucky, my partners will then just order me to be quiet while they hurt
me. Which creates a predicament! Because being quiet is actually not at all easy, and it
gets more difficult the more it hurts.

And then there's the distraction game. I don't always do BDSM with partners I'm sexually
attracted to; even with partners I'm sexually attracted to, I don't always feel sexual during
our BDSM encounters. But when I feel very attracted during a BDSM encounter, oh,
man. That's when I play the distraction game, which involves attempting to distract him
by turning him on. Again, I'm not really coherent enough to be planning strategy at times
like this; I'm more going on instinct; instinctively, it's like I'm trying to bargain. Maybe if
I can turn him on, he'll have sex with me instead of hurting me....

If I'm lucky, he'll recognize what I'm doing; he'll be pleased, amused even, but he won't
stop. One recent partner had me handcuffed to a car seat while he was hurting me. (Doing
this in his car was not my idea, but at least we weren't moving. Nor were we paused at a
traffic light.) I couldn't move too much, so I started licking his hand when he reached for
me. Kissing his palm, his fingers -- he groaned, and then he laughed.

You are a switch, he said, trying to control me even now. And he didn't stop.

te ok ok

No, I breathed, a few months ago, during an encounter with someone who's really good
at this. You don't get to say no,” he replied, so I bit back the word. Had to fight against
my own desperate instinct to say it, over and over.

Later, he murmured, It's so cute how you act like you don't want this, as he leaned in to
inflict dark bruises on my shoulder. His words almost brought me to tears. But J don't
want it. Do 1? How can I want something that hurts like this? But I'm not stopping him --
did I really ask for this -- I must want it -- Forcing me to face up to my own consent: a
predicament?

I fought back when he hurt me, instinctively pushing him away. Don't push me away,”
he instructed. Put your arms around me, and I did. But we moved around, and moved

voter turnout is up 66.6% over 2008 and 103.0% over 2012. | use both total turnout as well as equal weighted state turnout
because our Electoral College system for selecting a president is a combination of both. These numbers are astounding and
by themselves speak volumes for Republican prospects in 2016. And it is not just the Trump phenomenon; it’s the Trump
phenomenon plus much more.

But, the situation is worse for Democrats. When juxtaposed to the Democratic turnout in 2008 and 2016, the 2016 Republican
turnout looks even stronger. Remember, the 2012 Democratic primary was a non-event because President Obama, then a
sitting President, was running for nomination essentially uncontested. We therefore focus exclusively on the change from the
2008 to the 2016 Democratic Party turnout, which, using the same states, is down in total by 20.1%. And, using equal-weighted
state numbers, it’s down by 16.2%. Ona state-by-state comparison, Republican turnout is way up, and Democratic turnout is
way down. Someone should ring the Democratic alarm bell.

And, even head-to-head comparisons of absolute voter turnout between the Democratic and Republican primaries in 2016
and 2008 give the Republicans a definite edge for the elections of 2016 and an enormous increase over 2008. So far in 2016,
there have been 3.5 million more Republicans voting in their party’s primaries than there have been Democrats. In 2008, the
Democrats had over 11.3 million additional primary voter advantage over their Republican counterparts. This enormous
increase in Republican voter turnout over Democrats in 2016 plus the fact that there are more Republican voters in 2016 than
Democratic voters should be perhaps the single most disturbing statistic if you are a Hillary supporter, especially given the
exceptional enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders in what has turned out to be a down primary turnout for Democrats.

Even on a state-by-state basis, the flip from Democrat to Republican has been pronounced. So far in this 2016 primary season,
there are 14 new states that had Republican turnout in excess of Democratic turnout, i.e. those states in 2008 had more
Democratic turnout than Republican turnout, while in 2016 Republican turnout exceeds Democratic turnout. These states are
not, as Bernie Sanders would say, “chopped liver.” They include Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New
Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. When it comes to
the electoral college, flipping a state is far more important than is increasing the margin of victory.

What should be even more alarming to the Democrats than the party flip against Democrats in the 14 states that have already
had primaries is the fact that so far in every state, save Michigan, Democratic voter advantage over Republican’s has declined.
And Michigan, without trying to reach too far for excuses, appears to hinge on the tragedy of the Flint water contamination and
Mitt Romney’s candidacy in 2008 and 2012. And so as not to take everything away from the unique Michigan phenomenon,
it still must be remembered that in both 2008 and 2016, Republican primary turnout in Michigan was greater than Democratic
turnout.

Thanks for sending. A wide area of agreement, but not total. 
On confronting dogma, I of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. — 
are much more dangerous. And if some find rational discussion offensive — as, for example, mainstream academics 
find dismantling myths of American exceptionalism or Israeli self-defense or Obama's mass murder campaign, 
etc., offensive — so be it. 
But I don't see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, 
while recognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while 
their beliefs are confronted with evidence. I also don't see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as I don't 
think we should ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief 
with argument and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of 
secular dogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard 
sometimes. For example, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International 
Affairs informs us that the US, unlike other countries, has a transcendental purpose, and the fact that it constantly 
acts in contradiction to its purpose doesn't matter because the facts are just abuse of history while real history is 
the evidence of history as our minds reflect it, then it's hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There's no point 
ridiculing virtually the entire IR profession and the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads 
to major human disasters. 
On Davis, I frankly think that's a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment 
require (including following the law), then she can quit and look for another job. As in any other such case.

103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *894

branch is firmly committed to a robust enforcement policy against local government corruption that is also criminalized under
state law, and Congress has supported this agenda by enacting federal crimes intended to duplicate, or greatly overlap, state
offenses. !°4 In fact, federal statutes used in anti-corruption cases - [*895] like other federal criminal statutes - rely on and
incorporate state law in federal offense definitions. In light of this structure, federal prosecutions can claim to effectuate state

law goals - an especially straightforward version of federalism-based enforcement redundancy. !®

2. Sexual Assault

In sharp contrast to public corruption, enforcement redundancy through coextensive jurisdiction is largely nonexistent for a
large portion of the serious crimes that dominate state felony dockets, including sexual assaults, domestic violence, and
homicide. '°° Federal law reaches only a small number of these offenses when they intersect a special basis for federal
jurisdiction, such as interstate conduct - like human trafficking - or wrongs that occur on federal property or involve federal
employees. '®’ For most kinds of homicides, the lack of redundancy is only a modest hindrance to adequate enforcement;
holding aside distinctive exceptions - such as homicides by police or racially motivated lynchings - there 1s little evidence to
suggest patterns of homicide underenforcement in state justice systems. '°® Domestic violence and sexual assaults are a
different story. Like local public corruption, sexual assaults have long been a key example of [*896] serious wrongdoing to
which the responses of state and local criminal justice agencies have been deeply problematic. 1°

Underenforcement is hard to measure for sexual assaults as it is in other contexts, but central features of the problem are clear
enough. Rape and other forms of sexual assault are dramatically underreported crimes. !7° The leading government effort to
collect data on sexual assaults (and other crimes), the National Crime Victimization Survey, is widely thought to undercount
incidents of those offenses. '7! And rates of victim reports to police departments are even lower. The FBI Uniform Crime
Reports collects data on sexual assaults reported to local police agencies; the number is consistently well below the annual
number reported in the National Crime Victimization Survey. !7*

One reason that victims do not to report rapes to law enforcement is the perception that police and prosecutors (as well as
juries) are unduly skeptical of rape allegations. '7? And there is good evidence that law enforcement agencies’ responses to

19 See In re Petersen, No. 2:10-CV-298 RM, 2010 WL 5108692, at 2 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 8, 2010) (concluding that prosecutors control charging
decisions and certain victim rights under /8 U.S.C. § 377/(a), including the right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the
case,’ ... arise only after charges have been brought against a defendant and a case has been opened, although a victim's right to be treated

low, player 1 gets a > 0 if she cooperates and q > a if she defects. If the temptation is
high, she gets a if she cooperates and cp, > c if she defects. We assume that cooperation
benefits the other player, which we refer to as player 2. We assume, for simplicity, that
player 2 gets 6 > 0 if 1 cooperates and d < 0 if 1 defects, and that these payoffs to player 2
are the same regardless of 1’s temptation. For now, we also assume that d < p/(1 —p)-;
that is, defection is sufficiently harmful to player 2 that player 2 prefers to avoid the
interaction if player 1 only cooperates some of the time. Finally, we model player 2’s
trust in player 1. We model this by giving player 2 the choice of whether to continue
the interaction with player 1. If player 2 continues the interaction, then with probability
w, all previous steps are repeated, potentially indefinitely. That is, the temptation to
defect is randomly chosen again, player 1 chooses whether to look at it, and so on. With
probability 1 — w, the game ends. The parameter w can be interpreted as the likelihood
of a future interaction or the player’s discounting of future payoffs. Crucially, we assume
that player 2 observes both of player 1’s choices: not only whether 1 cooperated, but
also whether 1 first looked. Our model, therefore, applies to situations where player 1’s
looking is somewhat observable, for example, if player 1 can gain additional information
about the costs of defection by asking player 2 questions, or if player 1 can take time to
ponder the decision and player 2 can observe player 1’s reaction time. We assume that
players maximize their expected payoffs. Note that since we assumed a > 0 and 6 > 0,
both players benefit from a cooperative interaction.

In the envelope game, a strategy for player 1 dictates whether she will look and whether
she will cooperate, as a function of whether she has looked and cooperated in the past,
and as a function of the temptation if she has just looked. For example, one relatively

simple strategy for player 1 is to look and cooperate whenever the temptation is low.

deal with a major conflict with the Syrians. All of this, under a tight seal of
secrecy.

Finally, in early September 2007, everything was in place. Olmert briefed the
cabinet, and secured the ministers’ approval to destroy the reactor, with the
understanding that the precise timing of the operation would now be left to the
Prime Minister, the Defense Minister and the Foreign Minister: Olmert, me and
Tzipi Livni. The three of us met immediately after the cabinet discussion. Olmert
argued that the risk of leaks justified attacking that night, and I agreed with him.
Tzipi was reluctant, but Olmert turned to her and said: “Are you sure you’re
comfortable with an attack being ordered by me and Barak, while you chose to
abstain?” She thought it over, and added her approval.

We struck just after midnight, in an intricately coordinated air attack that
evaded not only a Syrian response, but Syrian notice. The reactor was destroyed.
Although even today the exact details remain subject to Israel’s military secrecy
regulations, accounts published abroad in the weeks and months that followed
painted a surprisingly accurate picture, including the pioneering use of electronic
warfare capabilities to deal with risk of radar detection. But in the immediate
aftermath of the attack, Israel deliberately made no public comment. We refused to
say whether we’d had anything to do with an attack. As we he had hoped, this
allowed the Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, both the space and a good reason to
deny that it had ever happened, deny that he’d been trying to make a nuclear
weapon, and thus feel no compelling reason to retaliate.

The reactor operation, however, marked the start of an increasingly tough
period in both my and Tzipi’s relationship with Olmert. Policy was not the
problem. There were no major security crises in the months ahead. But in the
spring of 2008, it became known that the Israeli police were investigating Olmert’s
relationship with an American businessman named Moshe Talansky. The
suggestion, initially in a New York paper and then the Israeli press, was that
Olmert was guilty of taking bribes. In his first public response, he didn’t deny

Police Code Enforcement
Re: ARCOM
Thursday, June 26, 2008 2:09:06 PM
JP,
Here is a copy of the minutes from the April CEB hearing. Each month thereafter the case was postponed
because we were aware that it was being brought to ARCOM. Now that this matter has been resolved
with ARCOM we will proceed with a code enforcement case until the property is in compliance (meaning
they plant the shrubbery and hedges approved by the Town).
Sgt. Krauel or Rob Walton will be available on July 23rd as I will be attending a conference.
H. Case # 08-2484, 515 N. County Road, Trump Properties, LLC
Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-205 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, the Architectural Commission may attach conditions to any approval it grants
(Declaration of Use Agreement).
Lead Code Enforcement Walton presented the facts of the case and said the previous
owner of the property, Abe Gosman, had been granted approval by the Architectural
Commission to do some remodeling. One of the conditions of this approval was that the
hedge along the front of the property be maintained in the condition it was in at the time the
approval was granted. This agreement was a binding agreement, which passes on to any
subsequent property owner. The agreement was made January 31, 1990. The subsequent
buyer of this property was Mr. Trump, Trump Properties, LLC and some remodeling work
was done, removing the previous hedge. A new hedge was planted to replace the original
hedge and that one has now been removed. This is a violation of the agreement. A letter was
received from Mr. Royce, representing Mr. Trump, asking for a postponement of today’s
hearing. The Town does not feel this matter should be postponed.
Mr. Randolph summarized the letter from Mr. Royce which indicated the ficus
hedge keeps dying and they want to replace it with something different. They plan on hiring a
landscape architect to go before the next Architectural Commission meeting to get approval to
install a hedge in an attempt to meet the conditions of the declaration of use agreement. Mr.
Randolph said he had discussions with Mr. Royce and Mr. Walton and Mr. Royce was told the
Town could not recommend a postponement and the recommendation would be that they are
found in violation, assessed the $150.00 in administrative costs and be given until June 18th,
which is the day before the June Code Enforcement Board meeting, to comply. This would
give them the opportunity to appear before the Architectural Commission to see if they can get
approval to re-plant a hedge. The hedge has to be installed to the height which existed at the
time of the agreement which Mr. Randolph said he believed was twenty-two (22) feet. Mr.
Randolph said Mr. Royce was not present today because he had a planned vacation.
MOTION BY MR. FRIED TO FIND THE VIOLATOR IN NON-
COMPLIANCE, ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF $150.00 AND GIVE THEM
UNTIL JUNE 18, 2008 TO COMPLY.
SECONDED BY MS. VAN BUREN
MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
From: John Page/PalmBeach
To: Kirk Blouin/PalmBeach@PalmBeach
Cc: Tim Frank/PalmBeach@PalmBeach
Date: 06/26/2008 09:00 AM
Subject: ARCOM
Kirk: We had our June monthly ARCOM meeting yesterday. You likely know that ARCOM is working
with Mr. Trump to re-install a hedge on his North County Road property. I believe this case is now
pending in front of Code Enforcement. In May, ARCOM approved a plan to replace the former hedge
with silver buttonwood shrubbery, which would additionally be back-planted with silver buttonwood
trees....the overall effect would be an eventual 20' high screen. The shrubs have been planted, but
yesterday attorney Ray Royce asked for postponing the trees until the end of the Hurricane season.
ARCOM said NO and directed the attorney and landscaper to get the trees in ASAP. Also, more
shrubbery was required at the main entry (north side) to match the newly installed hedge on the south
side.
As the meeting was ending, the Commissioners asked for one of two things. They asked that either 1) a
quick written report from Code Enforcement be made available to them at their next meeting on July 23
(9:00 a.m.) about the enforcement status of the case, or 2) that someone from Code Enforcement attend
their meeting to provide a verbal status report. Their patience is wearing thin with the whole hedge issue,
and it has them naturally curious about what is happening with their counterparts on Code Enforcement.
Would you or the appropriate representative from Code Enforcement be available on July 23? That
would be my preference because follow-up questions almost always pop up. If not, can you provide me
with a brief summary of your enforcement history and pending status? Thanks, JP

coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or
similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement
does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers a portfolio
company’s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim
reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover a portfolio
company’s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to
the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement
levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for
other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required
by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that
presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than
in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment
limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. A portfolio company’s inability to
promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and
private payors for any approved products that a portfolio company may develop could have a
material adverse effect on its operating results, its ability to raise capital needed to
commercialize products and its overall financial condition. This, in turn, could negatively affect
the performance of the Fund.

Political Risk; Current and Future Healthcare Reforms

Political events can have an impact on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. There can
be no guarantee that government's role in the healthcare industry will not adversely impact the
performance of the Fund.

In both the U.S. and foreign markets, sales of healthcare products and services and their success
will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors such as
government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations.
The levels of revenues and profitability of providers of healthcare products and services may be
affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce
the costs of health care. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly
approved health care products. There can be no assurance that a company’s proposed products
or services will be considered cost-effective or that adequate third-party reimbursement will be
available to enable a company to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return
on its investment.

Moreover, there continues to be significant interest among policy makers and government and
private payors in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in promoting changes in healthcare
systems to contain healthcare costs and improve the overall quality of care and wellness.

For example, on March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, which Congress modified pursuant to the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Act”). The Act expands insurance coverage to
more individuals, which could have a negative impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Among
the aspects of the Act that may have an adverse impact on the Fund are (i) mandatory annual
fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, (ii) discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs
for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries (i.e., those who are required to pay 100% of their

several dozen remained inside.

I was in Europe at the time, on one of my periodic trips to discuss Middle
East issues with a fellow intelligence chief. Yet an aide called me with the news.
I was several thousand miles away from what happening. But I knew there was
every possibility Sayeret Matkal might be called in, and my instincts told me we
should proceed with caution. The situation we were facing felt nothing like
Sabena, much less Entebbe. Here, we had a single bus. Our troops, and in fact
everyone from ministers and officials to reporters and photographers, were in a
loose cordon a couple of dozen yards away. That said to me there was no sense
that the hijackers posed an immediate danger. Nor did they seem to have come
equipped for a major confrontation. In place of the AK-47s and grenades we’d
seen in previous terror attacks, these guys had knives, and, if they were to be
believed, a couple of shells with no obvious way to detonate them.

I phoned a friend in the command post set up near the stranded bus. He told
me that Misha and Moshe Vechetzi were there. There was a standoff with the
terrorists and, for now, it was quiet. The defense minister and the chief-of-staff,
of course, did not need my presence, much less my agreement, to order the
sayeret into action. But I said: why not wait? Though the last flights back to
Israel had already left, I could be at the command post by mid-morning. Beyond
wanting to be present if the sayeret was ordered in, I believed the crisis might
even be brought to an end without another shot being fired. “III tell them what
you said,” my friend replied. “But I doubt it’Il be allowed to drag on much past
daybreak.”

He was right. With my Chinese Farm comrade Yitzhik Mordechai in overall
command, Sayeret Matkal stormed the bus at about seven in the morning. They
shot and killed two of the hijackers immediately, through the vehicle’s windows.
Sadly one of the passengers, a young woman soldier, died in the assault, but the
rest of the hostages were freed, none with serious injuries.

A controversy soon erupted over what came next. The sayeret commandos
had captured the other two terrorists alive and uninjured. Yet barely a week later,
first in an American newspaper and then the Israeli media, reports emerged that
the two surviving Palestinians had been killed after the hijacking was over. A
year later, Yitzhik Mordechai was — wrongly — put on trial for his alleged part in
what had amounted to a summary execution. And, rightly, exonerated. Though
the full details never became public, the people responsible turned out to be from
the Shin Bet, our equivalent of the FBI.

In Salman, an investment banker at Citigroup
tipped his brother about certain pending healthcare
mergers involving Citigroup clients. The
brother traded on that information for a profit,
and also tipped his brother-in-law, Mr. Salman,
who also traded for a profit. At trial, the government
relied solely on the tippers giving a gift of
inside information to a close family member to
satisfy the “personal benefit” requirement of tipper-tippee
insider trading liability. The government
did not identify any money or other valuable quid
pro quo paid for the tip. Salman was convicted at
trial, and his conviction was upheld by the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

a better commission for the adviser. The Obama
administration found that conflicted advice cost
savers about $17 billion a year based on a 2015
report. To be clear, the Rule applies only to retirement
accounts like 401(k)s and individual retirement
accounts (“IRAs”), not to regular taxable
accounts. According to the Investment Company
Institute, Americans invest $7.8 trillion in IRAs
and $7 trillion in 401(k)s.
On January 20, 2017, the DOL issued two new
sets of Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQs”) on
the Rule. One of the sets of FAQs focuses on the
new definition of fiduciary investment advice
and the other set is geared toward retirement
investors and consumers, covering consumer
protection features of the new Rule. This is the
second of three rounds of guidance to be published
by the DOL prior to the effective date of
the new Rule.
The Executive Branch also issued responses to
the Rule on January 20, 2017. The White House
issued a Memorandum from Reince Priebus to the
heads of the executive departments and agencies
requesting a sixty (60)-day delay as the effective
date of regulations published in the Office of the
Federal Register have not taken effect as of yet.
On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed a
presidential memorandum to delay the Rule by
six (6)-months, casting doubt on its viability.
The memorandum instructs the DOL to conduct
a new “economic and legal analysis” to determine
whether the Rule is likely to harm investors,
disrupt the industry or cause an increase
in litigation and the price of advice. If the DOL
concludes that the regulation does hurt investors
or firms, it can propose a rule “rescinding
or revising” the regulation. On March 1,
2017, the DOL issued a proposed rule, which
will extend the applicability date of its fiduciary
rule, including the Best Interest Contract
Exemption, from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017,
a 60-day delay.
Some are saying the Rule would hurt investors
because it would supposedly make it harder
for people to receive retirement advice. For
example, advisers would not be able to afford
to service low-balance retirement accounts.
On the other hand, consumer, labor and civil
rights groups have pushed for the Rule saying
that the current system provides a loophole
that lets brokers drain money from retirement
accounts in fees they receive that can sway
the investment advice they give their retirement
accounts. We see that many retirement
advisers already have chosen to act in their
clients’ best interests, opting to work under
the fiduciary standard—it is ultimately a
business advantage.
The FAQs are available on the DOL’s website
and the Memoranda are available on the White
House Press Office website.

Supreme Court Rejects Newman Requirement of “Pecuniary or Similarly Valuable” Personal
Benefit for Insider Trading Liability for Tipping Family and Friends (continued from page 2)
The Supreme Court affirmed Salman’s conviction,
holding that a gift of inside information to family or
friends is sufficient to prove a “personal benefit”
for insider trading tipping liability. The Court reasoned
that such a gift can be inferred to “provide
the equivalent of a cash gift.” 3 Specifically, the
Court reasoned that if the tipper personally traded
on inside information himself for a profit, but gave
the proceeds to his brother, the tipper received a
personal benefit (cash) and is liable for insider
trading. So, it reasoned, where a tipper achieves
effectively the same result by gifting the information
to his brother with the expectation that the
brother will trade on the information to obtain a
cash profit, the result should be the same.
Importantly, the Supreme Court explicitly stated
that it was narrowing the Second Circuit’s landmark
Newman decision. It stated, “[t]o the extent
the Second Circuit held that the tipper must also
receive something of a ‘pecuniary or similarly
valuable nature’ in exchange for a gift to family
or friends,… we agree with the Ninth Circuit that
this requirement is inconsistent with Dirks,” a prior
Supreme Court ruling. 4 This significantly lowers the
standard of proof for insider trading tipping liability
in cases involving family or friends. The government
often cannot find evidence of money or a similarly
valuable quid pro quo between the tipper and
tippee in insider trading cases. So it is much easier
to prove a case of insider trading by arguing that
the exchange of information was a “gift,” which
essentially only requires some evidence (even circumstantial
evidence such as phone logs) that the
tipper gave information to the tippee.
So where does this leave the Newman decision?
The Newman decision itself was not overturned by
the Supreme Court, because Newman also relied
on the lack of proof that the tippees who traded on
inside information knew that the tippers provided
Salman significantly lowers
the standard of proof for
insider trading tipping
liability in cases involving
family or friends.
inside information in exchange for a personal benefit—especially
since the tippees were several
steps removed from the original tippers. In addition,
Newman‘s “pecuniary or similarly valuable”
benefit test should still apply to cases that do not
involve tipping family or friends.
Nevertheless, the Salman decision tips the scales
back in favor of the government in tipping insider
trading cases. The SEC and federal prosecutors
have shown in the past that they will bring cases
based on alleged gifts of inside information to
mere social acquaintances, fellow employees, or
networking contacts —using strained arguments
of “friendship.” And they will bring insider trading
cases based solely on circumstantial evidence
(e.g., a pattern of phone calls) where there is no
direct proof of trading based on inside information.
Accordingly, with Salman imposing a lower
standard of proof, it is imperative that clients
contact counsel immediately at the first hint of a
government insider trading investigation.

A CAUTIONARY TALE IN THE USE OF
NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS
BY DOUGLAS R. HIRSCH AND JENNIFER ROSSAN
Employers should give careful consideration to
the inclusion of non-competition provisions in
employment agreements for low-level employees.
The New York Attorney General (the “AG”) recently
announced that it settled investigations with two
companies over their use of non-compete provisions
in employment agreements for low-level
employees. Policing non-compete provisions is a
new regulatory frontier for the AG and it is flexing
its regulatory muscle pursuant to § 63 (12) of
New York’s Executive Law, which provides the AG
with authority to enjoin businesses from utilizing
“unconscionable contractual provisions.” 1
The AG investigated and recently settled charges
with two companies—Law 360 and Jimmy John’s
Gourmet Sandwiches—based on their use of
“unconscionable” non-compete provisions in
employment contracts. In the Law 360 matter, the
Attorney General found that Law 360’s policy of
requiring the majority of its employees—including
“rank and file” editorial staff who had little to
no knowledge of any trade secrets or confidential
information—to sign a one-year non-compete was
contrary to New York law. Because these employees
did not have access to trade secrets and confidential
information, the AG charged that the noncompete
was not narrowly tailored to Law 360’s
legitimate business interests and did nothing more
than baldly restrain competition. As part of the settlement,
Law 360 agreed that, going forward, only
a small number of its highly paid executives would
be required to sign non-compete agreements.
Similarly, in its investigation of Jimmy John’s, the
AG found that some franchisees required sandwich
makers to sign two-year non-competes that prevented
them from working at any establishment
within a two-mile radius of a Jimmy John’s location
that made more than 10% of its revenue from
sandwiches. The AG charged that these employees
“are highly unlikely to be privy to trade secrets
or confidential customer lists or to have unique
skills.” Consequently, the AG concluded that the
non-compete provisions were “unconscionable”.
As part of its settlement, Jimmy John’s agreed to
inform its franchisees that the AG found the noncompete
provisions to be unlawful and void.
In both of these cases, the AG focused on the
effect of a non-compete provision on a low-level
employee. Companies should consider avoiding
the use of non-compete provisions for administrative
personnel and other non-managerial
staff. Such provisions are appropriate and are
more likely to withstand scrutiny when included
in the employment agreements of senior personnel
and individuals with unique skills—as
long as the provisions are drafted to protect a
legitimate business interest. Non-competes are
Non-competes are more
likely to be upheld if they
are designed to ensure that
a departing employee will
not provide a competitor
with an unfair competitive
advantage by supplying it
with the former employer’s
trade secrets and/or
confidential information.
more likely to be upheld if they are designed to
ensure that a departing employee will not provide
a competitor with an unfair competitive advantage
by supplying it with the former employer’s
trade secrets and/or confidential information.
However, it is important to note that requiring
all employees—including lower-level staff—to
adhere to confidentiality provisions that protect
proprietary information and trade secrets
does not implicate the same concerns, because
enforcement of such provisions does not restrain
the employee from working elsewhere. Therefore,
confidentiality provisions should be used in all
employment agreements where the employee’s
position involves access to confidential information
or trade secrets.
Even when a non-compete is appropriate—
such as in the case of a senior manager whose
departure would create an unfair advantage for
a competitor—its scope and duration must be
narrowly tailored to protect a legitimate business
interest. To be enforceable in New York,
a non-compete must be reasonable in time
and scope, necessary to protect the employer’s
legitimate interests, not harmful to the public
and not unreasonably burdensome to the
employee.
In addition to confidentiality provisions, employers
should strongly consider the use of a non-solicitation
provision in their employment agreements.
Non-solicitation provisions are generally enforceable
if they are reasonably related to the employer’s
interest in protecting relationships with clients
the employee worked with or became familiar with
while employed. But like non-compete agreements,
non-solicitation provisions must also be
limited in time and scope.

THE QUESTION ON ALL OF OUR MINDS: WHAT
IMPACT WILL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
HAVE ON THE HEDGE FUND INDUSTRY?
BY RON S. GEFFNER AND YEHUDA BRAUNSTEIN
Reprinted with permission of Hedgeweek
With the Trump administration in the White House,
regulatory uncertainty permeates the financial
services industry. While many on Wall Street are
very excited by the Trump presidency, others are
approaching this new era with trepidation. President
Trump is unpredictable in many ways, and the
industry eagerly awaits his actions hoping that the
financial markets do not respond negatively and
create chaos in the global marketplace.
While we should expect that the Trump administration
will aim to cut back financial regulation implemented
during the last eight years, it is unrealistic to expect
that these laws will be eliminated in their entirety.
Though the financial markets have been extremely
volatile of late and react very swiftly upon the
announcement of any meaningful global news, various
aspects of recent financial regulation have been
positive for the industry. For example, the requirement
for many investment advisers to register with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), one
of the requirements of The Dodd–Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd Frank”)
which was signed into federal law by President
Obama to be effective as of July 21, 2010, in retrospect,
has been viewed as a positive change within
the industry. Understandably, when initially introduced
in 2010, many asset managers located within
the United States and abroad that were required to
register as investment advisers with the SEC as a
result of Dodd-Frank were opposed to the changes.
However, many advisers, investors and regulators
now agree that requiring a larger number of advisers
to be accountable to higher regulatory standards has
created an environment where investors and counterparties
have more confidence in the oversight of
those managers and the industry as a whole.
It is also important to remember that any time
the government or a regulator changes the laws,
rules or regulations, those businesses affected
incur capital and opportunity costs in connection
with analyzing the changes in law and implementing
operational changes to comply with the new
laws. For example, when Dodd-Frank was originally
enacted, at the time of registration, those
investment advisers that were required to register
as advisers with the SEC were required to adopt
written policies and procedures and invested capital
into their operations and technology to support
compliance. Therefore, we expect that caution will
be exercised before significant change is made to
avoid the various costs associated with implementing
change. A case in point is the new DOL
Rule (discussed earlier in this newsletter), originally
set to take effect on April 10, 2017. Investment
advisers impacted by the DOL Rule, have
already been forced to analyze the DOL Rule and
its impact on their businesses, and some advisers
have already begun to implement changes to their
operations and procedures. The DOL Rule has been
the subject of much debate. While some industry
experts believe that the DOL Rule is onerous and
materially increases the costs associated with
providing services to clients, supporters of the
DOL Rule believe that it is necessary to protect
investors against brokers who are unnecessarily
selling high-fee investments to their clients. On
February 3, 2017, President Trump signed a memorandum
to delay the DOL Rule by six (6)-months.
On March 1, 2017, the DOL issued a proposed
rule, which will extend the applicability date of its
fiduciary rule, including the Best Interest Contract
Exemption, from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017, a
60-day delay. If the DOL Rule is ultimately modified
or even eliminated, some advisers may have to
reverse their recently-implemented changes.
In conclusion, we do not believe that regulations
in the financial industry will be eliminated in their
entirety. For example, if the requirement to register
as an investment adviser with the SEC is materially
modified or no longer required, we expect that many
investment advisers would maintain their registration
as it is perceived to be a competitive advantage
compared to those managers that are not registered.
While we expect the Trump administration to improve
the financial services industry by having more balanced
regulations, we believe that this administration
will quickly realize that there are a lot of reasonable
and sensible regulations currently in place that are
working well, and that eliminating rules wholesale
can create chaos in the financial markets and may
come at a high price to their constituents.

An adviser is required to deliver Form ADV Part 2 to clients; it is not required to deliver Form ADV

recommended that an adviser delivers Form ADV Part 2 to each investor in a pooled investment vehicle.

Although Regulation S-P does not specify the exact day by which the annual privacy notice must
be sent, May 30 seems to be an appropriate date because the mailing can be coordinated with
delivery of Form ADV Part 2 (which can include the Privacy Policy) to clients or fund investors.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 does not specify that any training session is necessary, and
therefore the date on which training should occur is not specified. However, a registered adviser
must distribute and receive signed acknowledgements of changes to its code of ethics. Since the
code (as well as an adviser’s compliance policies and procedures) may be amended as part of
an adviser’s annual review, as well as at any other time, quarterly training should help to keep
personnel up-to-date regarding policies and procedures and otherwise remind personnel of their
compliance obligations.
SEC & FINRA RELEASE 2017 EXAM PRIORITIES
BY DANIEL G. VIOLA
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
released their Exam Priorities for 2017. The SEC’s
2017 priorities are organized around the following
areas: (1) examining matters of importance to retail
investors; (2) focusing on risks specific to elderly
and retiring investors; and (3) assessing marketwide
risks. FINRA also issued its 2017 Regulatory
and Examinations Priorities Letter, which identifies
compliance, supervision and risk management as
areas of focus. FINRA will be introducing a compliance
calendar and a directory of service providers
as tools to assist firms. FINRA will also be initiating
electronic, off-site reviews to supplement traditional
on-site cycle examinations. These off-site exams will
affect only a select group of firms that are not currently
scheduled for a cycle exam in 2017.
The SEC priorities address issues across a variety
of financial institutions, including investment
advisers, investment companies, broker-dealers,
transfer agents, clearing agencies, private
fund advisers, national securities exchanges
and municipal advisers. Under each category, a
number of key exam areas include:
1. Protecting Retail Investors:
■ Electronic Investment Advice
■ Wrap Fee Program
■ Exchange-Traded Funds
■ Never-Before Examined Investment Advisers
■ Recidivist Firms and Their Employees
■ Multi-Branch Advisers
■ Share Class Selection
2. Focusing on Senior Investors and
Retirement Investments:
■ ReTIRE – Retirement-Targeted Industry
Reviews and Examinations
■ Public Pension Advisers
■ Senior Investors
3. Assessing Market-Wide Risks:
■ Money Market Funds
■ Payment for Order Flow
■ Clearing Agencies
■ FINRA
■ Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity
■ Cybersecurity
■ National Securities Exchanges

“T don't know this woman. I've never been in the same place with
her. She’s made the whole story up out of whole cloth.” ;

Bradley Edwards had already become involved in lawsuits
against Epstein. In 2007, working with a former federal judge
and University of Utah law professor named Paul Cassell, he had
Gled a lawsuit on behalf of another unnamed woman. Six years
later, that case is still pending, and now, Edwards and Cassell i
petition to have the two suits combined.

Allin all, four Jane Does take part in the lawsuit.

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts, the girl who says that Ghis-
laine Maxwell recruited her for Epstein at Trump's resort,
Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein had “lent” her and other young girls to prominent
businessmen, important politicians, world leaders, and other  s
powerful men in order “to ingratiate himself with them for busi-

ness, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain

blackmail information,” Roberts claims.

She says that Epstein forced her and other underage girls to
take part in an orgy in the Virgin Islands.

She names Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz as two of the 4
men she'd been forced to have sex with and claims that Der 9
showitz had been “an eyewitness to the sexual abuse of many q
other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein's co-conspirators. 7

This time, Prince Andrew does respond to the allegations. a

“This relates to longstanding and ongoing civil proceedings P
in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party,”
Buckingham Palace says in a short statement. “As such we would ,
not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubly

any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is catego if

cally untrue.” 3

the Great Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution,
these and other aspects of the party's past were not
considered utterly taboo, as long as the discussion did
not lead to serious challenges to orthodox historical
interpretations. According to the policies set down
under Xi Jinping’s leadership, talking in classrooms
about Mao's errors is now forbidden.’5

The drive to inculcate a national amnesia on the
worst abuses of the Communist era is not limited to
university courses. Commentary and discussion in the
media and on the internet are also heavily censored,
especially on anniversary days when, in normal
societies, problematic events of the past are remem-
bered and debated.** The most sensitive anniversary,
of course, falls on June 4, marking the deadly 1989
crackdown on prodemocracy protests in Tiananmen
Square. Even the most oblique or coded reference to
that date on social media is quickly censored.

There are no museums cevoted the Cultural Rev-
olution or the Great Leap Forward. The archives of
the Cultural Revolution period are mainly closed to
researchers. Chinese historians have made some im-
portant breakthroughs, but can discuss their findings
only with small groups of peers.

The Communist Party's refusal to come to terms with
the crimes of the Mao era has enabled a revival of
the former leader's personality cult that has captured
the support of millions of Chinese. As Jamil Anderlini
wrote in the Financial Times, Mao has come to be
seen as a symbol of a “simpler, fairer society—a time
when everyone was poorer but at least they were
equally poor.””” Xi and his colleagues have actively
promoted Maoist images, songs, and propaganda
themes as ornaments of Chinese nationalism, and
used Mao-style tactics and terminology in their drive
for ideological discipline and political loyalty.

The melding of nationalism and reverence for Mao is
no accident. According to the regime's updated histor-
ical narrative, China was subjugated by foreign powers
for more than a century until the party took power in
1949 and restored the country’s national greatness.
Admitting Mao's abuses would mean admitting that
the first three decades of Communist rule left China
poor, isolated, and traumatized, and that only the
partial abandonment of party doctrine and control
allowed the country to prosper.

A side effect of the party's appropriation of Chinese na-
tionalism is a renewed hostility toward the foreign pow-

ers that kept China weak before Communist rule. Basic
history textbooks—in addition to omitting or distorting
the mistakes, failures, and criminal acts of the Commu-
nist leadership—focus on China's persecution at the
hands of outsiders, especially Japan. Some Chinese
critics worry that the teaching of history is cultivating
an alarming degree of xenophobia and jingoism.”°

History held hostage

In much of the world today, there are or have been
major efforts to confront uncomfortable truths

about the past. This is certainly true of Germany and
South Africa. Latin American countries like Chile and
Argentina have probed the histories of ugly conflicts
between military juntas and Marxist revolutionaries. In
China's own backyard, South Korea and Taiwan have
moved to address the complex legacies, including
outright crimes, of dictators.

The process of accounting for the mistakes and
crimes of earlier decades can raise a tangle of ethical
and emotional challenges in any country. But resis-
tance to a full examination of the past is especially
bitter in societies where communism held sway. In
China, the heirs of Mao still control the state, and the
very legitimacy of the system is built on a veneration
of the Great Helmsman. In Russia, the Putin leader-
ship praises the achievements of Stalin and aspires to
the superpower status of the Soviet Union. A conse-
quence of this ahistorical nostalgia is that in Russia
today, 26 percent of those polled by Levada believe
that Stalinist repression was necessary; a decade
ago, the figure was just 9 percent. Likewise, only 45
percent told Levada that political persecution was a
crime; in 2007, the figure was 72 percent.”

The communist system was responsible for four of

the most destructive episodes of the 20th century:
Stalin’s purges, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural
Revolution, and the Cambodian genocide. Add to this
the persecutions inflicted on the people of the Baltic
states, Eastern Europeans, Cubans, North Koreans,
and many others, and the population affected by mass
killings and misery swells even further. While few peo-
ple today admire totalitarian Marxism as a governing
system, there is a reluctance to reject it with the same
moral clarity as in assessments of Nazism. Scholars,
not to mention political figures, who express even mod-
est admiration for Hitler are immediately and properly
condemned. As long as Stalin and Mao, two of history's
worst mass murderers, escape similar opprobrium in
their own countries, a reckoning with historical truth
and an understanding of its lessons will be postponed.

SNOWDEN’S ARC

I woke this morning with a new name. I had had a vision.
A dream vision. A vision righteous and true. Before me I saw
Gamers, Gamers shrouded in the glory of their true names.
Step forth, and assume your name in the pantheon. It’s
always been there, your avatar’s true name. It slips through ®
your subconscious, reveals itself under your posts, and
flashed visibly in that moment of unrestrained spite; in the
indulgent teabag. You've felt it, known it, recognized it.
Now realize it.

I woke this morning with a new name. That name is

Wolfking.

Herman said Robson instructed Jane Doe No. 3, When he asks how old you are, tell him 18 or 19 years
old. But he said it doesn't matter. They were underage girls, Herman said. They were sexually
assaulted. OS

In addition to the civil lawsuits, Epstein was indicted on a single count of felony solicitation of
prostitution in July 2006 after a lengthy Palm Beach Police Department investigation into his activities
with underage girls at his home. A resolution has been delayed continually. The case is on Monday's
court docket but is expected to be rescheduled once again.

One of the reasons (Jane Doe No. 3) came forward is she is tired of waiting for justice, Herman said.

V: I can’t remember which one it was. I want to say Bill Riley is the good one.

JS: Alright, so either Bill Riley or a Mr. Goldberger or both of them contacted you, and what
do you remember about that?

V: I don’t know if it was the same guy who contacted me that week later who put me in
touch with Jeffrey. I think he was on the phone and he put speakerphone on with Jeffrey.
So he connected me with Jeffrey. I don’t know if it was the same guy or different, but I
definitely know that Bill Riley was the first guy to contact me. I’m pretty sure about that.

JS: Ok. Tell me about that conversation.

V: He asked me what I knew about what’s going on with Jeffrey and apparently, there was
an investigation being held about some of the girls who had come out and said that
Jeffrey had sexual contact with them under the age of a minor and that he was
discrediting lot of these girls and making them out to be drug addicts and prostitutes and
what have you so they wouldn’t be looked upon as worthy in the court’s eyes so to speak.
And you know, he told me in the first five minutes that, you know, if I stay quiet, that
“T’ll be looked after” . And that was the exact way it was said. It wasn’t like you know,
I’m gonna pay you a zillion dollars or anything if you be quiet, but if I stay quiet, I would
“looked after”. And I remember saying I don’t want any part to do with this. You know,
this is not something I want to be a part of, ve got a young family. I wish the best for
everybody in this, you know, take care kind of thing. A week later, I was called after the
hearing by one of Jeffrey’s lawyers. I can’t tell you exactly which one it was but he had
Jeffrey on the other line and he connected Jeffrey and I, and Jeffrey tried to make some
simple conversation, “How are you? How have things been?” You know what I mean,
catching up.

JS: Do you know if the lawyer, did the lawyer stay on the line while Jeffrey was speaking to
you?

V: I’m pretty sure he did. That’s why I think Jeffrey was on speaker phone because it
sounded a lot different, and I was never taken off the line to begin with or connected to
another line, so I was pretty sure Jeffrey was on speaker phone and the lawyer was
making the call. After the simple conversation, it led to what was going on again and you
know, Jeffrey couldn’t believe it. You know, he thought he helped all these girls out. He
didn’t think he was wrong in any circumstance here at all. A lot of these girls were drug
addicts and just after drug money. You know, he was really putting down these women
or these girls I should say, not giving them the credit they deserved, and then he exactly
repeated what the lawyer said the week before is that he would look after me if I stayed
quiet, and if I need any help, you know, his lawyers would represent me and he would get
legal help for me, whatever I need, he would do, and I told him exactly, I said, “Jeffrey,
I’m the mother of two children at that stage. I’m away from everything there, I don’t
want to be a part of it. I’m not going to speak to anybody and I don’t want to speak to
anybody, I don’t want to be involved.” That was the last time I heard from him. And the

chances.” That was the last I heard, until a few years later when Dean Griswold informed me that
the chairman of the overseers subcommittee being asked to review and approve the faculty
decision recommending me for tenure, was an active member of “the Club.” I was ready for a
fight. But there was no fight. I was approved, the dean later told me, by a unanimous vote.

Several years after I began teaching, I was invited to deliver a distinguished named lectureship at
a major university. Following my talk, there was a dinner in my honor at the local university club.
When I got to the club, there were several women standing outside picketing because it was a
men’s only club. I refused to cross the picket line and the dinner had to be moved to a different
venue, over the strong objections of the Chief Justice of the State, who was one of the sponsors
to the dinner. I had a similar experience in Columbus, Ohio, after I argued an important case on
behalf of a local law firm. They invited my female associate and me to have dinner with them at
the local university club. When we got there, they asked my associate if she wouldn’t mind
walking in through the side door since the main entrance was for men only. Since she was a
young associate, she reluctantly agreed, but I refused to let her demean herself. We had lunch at
the local McDonald’s. Several years later, I was invited to Australia to give a series of lectures,
and the Harvard Club of Sydney asked me to give a luncheon talk to Harvard alumni. I agreed.
When I mentioned to a friend that I was going to be speaking at the Australia Club, he advised me
that it was closed to Jews, women, and Blacks. I gave the Harvard Club two options: I would
keep my commitment and make my speech, but I would speak about why it was wrong for
Harvard to hold events at segregated clubs; or they could move the speech and I would give a talk
about life at Harvard. They chose the second alternative. When I returned to Harvard, I wrote to
the dean and a memo was circulated mandating that henceforth no Harvard professors, speaking
on behalf of Harvard, should appear in a segregated venue. When a Jewish country club in
Boston asked me to talk, I told them about my policy and declined the invitation. They explained
that the club had been established in reaction to the unwillingness of other country clubs in the
area to accept Jewish members. I told them that I did not think this justified further
discrimination. A few days later, the membership chairman called and told me that, in fact, the
club had six non-Jewish members and that it was open to accepting more. I made the speech. A
young member approached me following my speech and told me I had been conned, “Sure, we
have six non-Jewish members, but they’re all sons-in-law of Jewish members.” I have never
spoken at that club again.

When I joined the faculty, it was quite small—perhaps two dozen full time professors. (Today
there are more than 100, with a student body that hasn’t increased in size.) The entire faculty
would meet for lunch every day in a small dining room around a large table presided over by the
dean, and in his absence by a senior faculty member. The discussions would revolve around legal
issues. The criteria for judging an argument and its maker was its “soundness.” That word still
rings in my ear, like my grandmother’s “meturnished.” All faculty nominees had to have “sound”
judgment. Their writing had to be “sound,” rather than creative, speculative, quirky or
provocative. I was concerned because my views were anything but “sound”—as least as judged
by some of the more traditional faculty members.

Recently, I told one of my long-time colleagues that when I was choosing between teaching at

Harvard and Yale Law Schools, my Yale Law School teacher, mentor and friend, Professor Alex
Bickel, who had been turned down for a professorship at Harvard because his views of

by a continued environmwnt of rising interest. Leverage for S&P non-Financials has
steadily been ticking up over the last few years, and, if we exclude the cash-rich

Technology sector, leverage is approaching all-time highs (Chart 9).

$8-9 (6-7%) hit to GAAP EPS from the mandatory tax on accumulated overseas

profit

We estimate that a tax of accumulated overseas profits of $1.2tn would result in a cash
tax impact of $100-120bn (which may be allowed to be paid over 8-10 years), and a
one-time hit to GAAP EPS of $8-9 (a lower $65-80bn, given that a several large
multinationals such as AAPL already provision for US taxes on a portion of their
overseas profit, resulting in effective US tax rates well above the US statutory rate}. Our
analysis assumes Trump’s/the Blueprint’s proposed rates of 8.75%/10%, and that all
overseas profits are hit with this one-time tax, as suggested by their plans. See Table

10.

Note that our estimate of ~$1.2tn of cumulative profits overseas is based on estimates
from us, our fundamental analysts, and company filings, where in many cases only
overseas cash but not other indefinitely invested earnings are disclosed/estimated.
Thus, the tax on these earnings could be slightly higher, though the Blueprint would tax
earnings not held in cash at a lower 3.5% rate. (We conservatively assume our estimated
$1.2tn is all cash and use the higher 8.75% rate under the Blueprint and 10% under

Trump’s plan in our below analysis}.

be contemplating with great care is the connected skein that enmeshes us and all
these connected knots of worry. We will see, over and over again, the way in which
connection shifts, alters and even destroys the way an object moves and lives. The
main point here is straightforward: New links, exploding into operation around us
everywhere now, alter everything from how terrorists operate to how investments
perform. And the failure to spot, use and understand that fact will be a source of our
biggest future tragedies. Do you feel the global economy is more stable now than in
2008? Are we less susceptible to terror now? Is your data more secure than in the
past? What do all these problems have in common?

Perhaps we're targeting the wrong things.

If the idea of a Seventh Sense for our changing world is quickly apprehensible
enough - It’s that gut feeling that seems to animate wild new businesses or attacks or
risks - the deeper logic will be harder to name and master. We will have to consider
the most ancient instincts for power and safety in light of the very newest
technological experiences: speed, machine intelligence, really constant connection.
“Instead of thinking in terms of surfaces - two dimensions - or spheres - three
dimensions - on is asked to think of nodes that have as many dimensions as they
have connection,” the French philosopher Bruno Latour has written of a network
age. “Modern societies cannot be described without recognizing them as having a
fibrous, thread-like, wiry, string, ropy, capillary character that is never captured by
the notions of levels, layers, territories, spheres, categories, structures, systems.”!9
Familiar borders, like the ones dividing science and politics or military power and
civilian safety begin to erode when everything is linked. Computing machines and
networks were once locked into usefully narrow silos, unconnected: banking,
medical monitoring, power grids. In the past you could mark them as having
“levels”. But now they overlap and inform each other, meshed into that stringy
surface Latour describes.2° The Seventh Sense is a feeling for just how this world
might be navigated; how those fibers might be pulled and yoked to new purposes.

This multitude of interwoven links is why networks and their pieces spill now even
into the non-digital elements of our life, from how we grow our food (with GPS-
guided, self-driven tractors) to how we fight our wars (from a distance, using
constantly connected drones.) As a result, many of the technical choices we’re about
to make will be strikingly political. Who has access to what data? Where is the line
