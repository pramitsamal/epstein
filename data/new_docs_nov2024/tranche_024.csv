Subject: could you put something like this out. if you want 
I have to hand it to ms . I'm sure she deserves the pretty penny she has made for her effort. She has 
certainly caught the imagination of a public hungry for salacious fiction. To suggest her story is anything other 
than that, a fiction, is ludicrous. Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( clinton was never ever there, easy 
to confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small even for one adult ). sex slave being paid 
thousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, she was working as a hostess in a burger bar ). being 
lent out to a prime minister though this prime mininster, never out of sight of his massive security detail also 
never visited the island„ sex on a small airplane with a famous lawyer while the other passengers must have 
been all looking out the window during the event . I would have thought that her fabrications were readilly 
apparent , but now , being asked to deny what the press has termed her allegations is frankly silly. ok, to 
play along I deny each and every allegation. The only person she didn't suggest she was forced to have sex 
with , was Bilbo Baggins. , maybe its in the sequel.

example, perhaps MOSES would discover that older males wearing ties tend not to become
regular visitors. If the new playmate is an older male wearing a tie, this is directly applicable.
But if the current playmate is wearing a tuxedo, then PLN may be helpful via reasoning that
even though a tuxedo is not a tie, it’s a similar form of fancy dress — so PLN may extend the
MOSES-learned rule to the present case and infer that the new playmate is not likely to be a
regular visitor.

6.5 Goal-Oriented Dynamics in CogPrime

CogPrime’s dynamics has both goal-oriented and “spontaneous” aspects; here for simplicity’s
sake we will focus on the goal-oriented ones. The basic goal-oriented dynamic of the CogPrime
system, within which the various types of memory are utilized, is driven by implications known
as “cognitive schematics”, which take the form

Context \ Procedure > Goal < p>

(summarized C A P > G). Semi-formally, this implication may be interpreted to mean: “If the
context C' appears to hold currently, then if I enact the procedure P, I can expect to achieve the
goal G with certainty p.” Cognitive synergy means that the learning processes corresponding to
the different types of memory actively cooperate in figuring out what procedures will achieve
the system’s goals in the relevant contexts within its environment.

CogPrime’s cognitive schematic is significantly similar to production rules in classical ar-
chitectures like SOAR and ACT-R (as reviewed in Chapter 4; however, there are significant
differences which are important to CogPrime’s functionality. Unlike with classical production
rules systems, uncertainty is core to CogPrime’s knowledge representation, and each CogPrime
cognitive schematic is labeled with an uncertain truth value, which is critical to its utilization by
CogPrime’s cognitive processes. Also, in CogPrime, cognitive schematics may be incomplete,
missing one or two of the terms, which may then be filled in by various cognitive processes
(generally in an uncertain way). A stronger similarity is to MicroPsi’s triplets; the differences
in this case are more low-level and technical and have already been mentioned in Chapter 4.

Finally, the biggest difference between CogPrime’s cognitive schematics and production rules
or other similar constructs, is that in CogPrime this level of knowledge representation is not
the only important one. CLARION [SZ04], as reviewed above, is an example of a cognitive
architecture that uses production rules for explicit knowledge representation and then uses a
totally separate subsymbolic knowledge store for implicit knowledge. In CogPrime

both explicit and implicit knowledge are stored in the same graph of nodes and links, with

e explicit knowledge stored in probabilistic logic based nodes and links such as cognitive
schematics (see Figure 6.8 for a depiction of some explicit linguistic knowledge.)

e implicit knowledge stored in patterns of activity among these same nodes and links, defined
via the activity of the “importance” values (see Figure 6.9 for an illustrative example thereof)
associated with nodes and links and propagated by the ECAN attention allocation process

The meaning of a cognitive schematic in CogPrime is hence not entirely encapsulated in its
explicit logical form, but resides largely in the activity patterns that ECAN causes its activation
or exploration to give rise to. And this fact is important because the synergetic interactions
of system components are in large part modulated by ECAN activity. Without the real-time

Illustrative Schematic: Centralized Network versus Distributed Network

Centralized Network Distributed Network

= Blockchain is the critical and differentiating infrastructure that underlies cryptocurrencies.

= Unlike most networks today, which rely on a centralized hub, a blockchain is a public distributed network whose
complete database can be accessed and maintained by each member of the network.

# The blockchain is a shared and continually reconciled database. As new transactions occur, data is quickly
disseminated to, verified, and incorporated across all nodes on the network.

= Because it has no single maintainer, the blockchain’s history is resistant to editing by a malicious actor.

Is there no sense of shame in that building? Has the word hypocrisy lost all meaning
across the street? Does no one recognize the need for a single, neutral standard of human
rights? Have human rights now become the permanent weapon of choice for those who
practice human wrongs? For shame. For shame.

As I spoke these harsh words in the shadow on the U.N. building, I wondered what my mentor
Arthur Goldberg, who left a lifetime job on the Supreme Court, to go to the U.N., would think of
what I was saying. He always defended and supported me, but he loved and admired the U.N. I
think he would have approved of the thrust of my talk, if not of every word, as he did when
another one of his mentees, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, used powerful words to condemn the
actions of the U.N.

If an organization—governmental or non-governmental—is to remain true to a genuine
commitment to universal and neutral human rights, it must prioritize the use of its resources.
“The worst first” must be its governing criteria. The “worst” has two major components. First
and foremost is the nature and scope of the human wrongs: genocide, mass murder, widespread
torture and mutilation of dissidents, rape as a policy, slavery, genuine apartheid and other
comparable abuses. Second is the inability of victims to secure relief from the judiciary, from
human rights groups, from the media and from other domestic sources. Failure to prioritize is a
sure sign of bias and lack of neutrality. Today’s U.N. and most “human rights” NGOs fail this
test.

My defense of Western democracies, and most particularly Israel, against deliberately exaggerated
charges regarding human rights, led to an offer that presented me with an existential challenge to
my dual identity as an American and a Jew. In 2010, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin
Netanyahu, urged me to accept the position of Israel’s Ambassador to the U.N. He told me that
in order to serve in that capacity, I would have to become an Israeli citizen, though I could also
retain my American citizenship. I realized immediately that I could never accept the offer, despite
the reality that I would have enjoyed the job immensely. The idea of standing up against the
hypocrisy and double standard of the UN appealed to me. But it was clear to me that I am an
American, not an Israeli. For me to switch sides—even to a nation that is so close an ally to my
own nation—would raise the spectre of dual loyalty that has been directed at Jews since Biblical
times, when they lived as minorities in the lands of Egypt and Persia.'°

After much discussion and arm twisting, I finally persuaded Netanyahu that if I accepted the
position, it might be good for me, but it would not be good for American Jews or for Israel. So I
declined, after promising the Prime Minister that I would be available, as an international lawyer
and an American, to help defend Israel against unjust charges brought by international bodies such
as the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice and various UN agencies. I
will also continue to criticize Israel’s human rights record when criticism based on a single
universal standard is warranted by its actions.

Article 7.

Hurriyet

Why Golda Meir was right

Burak Bekdil

August 23, 2011 -- It has been more than two and a half years since
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told to Israeli President
Shimon Peres’s face, “You (Jews) know well how to kill.” Prime
Minister Erdogan has also declared more than a few times that the
main obstacle to peace in this part of the world is Israel, once calling
the Jewish state “a festering boil in the Middle East that spreads hate
and enmity.” In this holy month of Ramadan full of blood on Muslim
territories, let’s try to identify who are the ones who know well how
to kill. As the Syrian death count clicks every day to come close to
2,000, the Turkish-Kurdish death count does not stop, already over
40,000 since 1984, both adding to the big pool of blood called the
Middle East. Only during this Ramadan, the Kurdistan Workers’
Party, or PKK’s, death toll has reached 50 in this Muslim Kurds vs.
Muslim Turks war. This excludes the PKK casualties in Turkey and
in northern Iraq due to Turkish military retaliation since they are
seldom accurately reported.

Let’s speak of facts.

Sudan is not in the conventional Middle East, so let’s ignore the
genocide there. Let’s ignore, also, the West Pakistani massacres in
East Pakistan (Bangladesh) totaling 1.25 million in 1971. Or 200,000
deaths in Algeria in war between Islamists and the government in
1991-2006. But a simple, strictly Middle East research will give you
one million deaths in the all-Muslim Iran-Iraq war; 300,000 Muslim
minorities killed by Saddam Hussein; 80,000 Iranians killed during
the Islamic revolution; 25,000 deaths in 1970-71, the days of Black
September, by the Jordanian government in its fight against the

about John Rawls and John Locke, a social contract between the
government and the governed. A Palestinian government that denies
his rights, he insisted, is as offensive as an Israeli one. When I
pressed him on whether his colleagues want two states—one
Palestinian, one Jewish—or a secular binational one, he seemed
strangely agnostic. He said that in an ideal world one democratic state
would be better, before adding that of course such a state would have
to guarantee the safety and cultural autonomy of Jews. (One of his
inspirations, he said, was Martin Buber, the Jewish philosopher who
advocated a binational state in the 1920s and 1930s). When I said I
didn’t consider a binational state very realistic, he conceded the
point, before noting that in the age of Netanyahu and Lieberman,
most Palestinians don’t consider a two-state solution very realistic
either. After a while, it hit me: This is what Israelis and American
Jews have been demanding all along. Didn’t we always say, during
the bloody Arafat years, that when the Palestinians produced Gandhis
everything would change? We’d never be able to resist; our Jewish
hearts would melt. Now that it’s starting to happen, I suspect the
response will be exactly the opposite: Yes, there’s something
admirable about young people like Fadi Quran, but who are they
kidding. This is the Middle East, not Palo Alto. It’s no place for
dreamers; they’ll get eaten for lunch.

Privately, many in Congress consider settlement expansion a
catastrophe and the occupation a disgrace.

Maybe so. But watching over Fadi’s shoulder as members of
Congress robotically rose to applaud Netanyahu, I couldn’t help
thinking of the contrast. Anyone who has spent any time around
Congress knows that many of the people who applauded Netanyahu—
the Jewish Democrats in particular—don’t actually support his
policies. Privately, many consider settlement expansion a catastrophe
and the occupation a disgrace. But they don’t want to create

9 DIRECT EXAMINATION 
10 BY MS. HADDAD: 
11 Q. Well, Scott, I know you've talked about this 
12 probably more than you even care to, but I'd like to 
13 start a little bit asking you about the scheme at your 
14 firm and how arid when it started and things of that 
15 nature just very briefly because] know you've covered 
16 it many times. 
17 MR. SCAROLA: It has been covered and 
18 protocol precludes asking questions that have already 
19 been answered and covering areas that have already 
20 been covered, so we do object. 
21 MR. GOLDBERGER: Your objection is noted. 
22 BY MS. HADDAD: 
23 Q. When did this first start? 
24 A. It started back in '05, '06. The question 
25 is a little bit vague for me because it started in a 
Page 5

FRIEDMAN, LOMBARDI & OLSON 
305-371-6677 
5ed93085-0554-447f-bcdd-ca2d8fe941df 
different form than it ended because it started as 
2 bridge loans and things of that nature, and then 
3 morphed into the Ponzi scheme. But you are looking 
4 back into the 2005 time frame for the very beginning. 
5 Q. The 2005 time frame, that's when the bridge 
6 loans started? 
A. I can't be certain exactly what we were 
8 doing. I need to see all the documents to tell you 
9 what we were doing at what specific point in time. 
1 0 Q. What made you decide to start doing this? 
1 1 A. I started doing it out of greed and the need 
1 2 to support the law firm, which was having significant 
1 3 financial trouble at the time. 
1 4 Q. And in 2005 had you moved over to 401 yet or 
1 5 were you still in the building where Colonial Bank 
16 was? 
1 7 A. I don't remember. 
1 8 Q. Do you recall approximately how many 
1 9 attorneys you had working for you when it started? 
2 0 A. I do not. Between five and ten, Tonja. 
2 1 Q. Was it before you started acquiring 
2 2 attorneys like you were acquiring cars and watches? 
2 3 MR. SCAROLA: Object to the form of the 
2 4 question, vague. 
25 THE WITNESS: Yes. 
Page 
1 BY MS. HADDAD: 
2 Q. Well, who were you partners with when it 
3 first started? 
4 A. Stu Rosenfeldt. 
5 Q. Okay. Anyone else? 
6 A. Susan Dolin, I believe. It was definitely 
7 Stu Rosenfeldt, Michael Pancier, and Susan Dan may 
8 have been partners of ours at that time, I'm not 
9 certain. 
1 0 Q. Because if memory serves me correctly, you 
1 1 went from being in the One Financial Plaza Building to 
1 2 the building across the street, it was Rothstein, 
1 3 Rosenfeldt, Dolin and Pancier; is that correct? 
14 A. Yes. 
1 5 Q. And it was some time later that you moved 
1 6 into the 401 Building, correct? 
1 7 A. You are skipping one step. I went from One 
1 8 Financial Plaza to Phillips, Eisinger, Koss, Kusnick, 
1 9 Rothstein and Rosenfeldt. Then Stu Rosenfeldt and I 
2 0 broke off and formed Rothstein Rosenfeldt. And then 
2 1 Rothstein, Rosenfeldt, Dolin, Pancier over at the 
2 2 Colonial Bank Building. And then we took the space in 
2 3 the 401 Building and eventually moved over there and 
2 4 that's when the real growth started. 
2 5 Q. And when you say, that's when the real

growth started, do you mean both the scheme -- do you 
mean the scheme and the fin-n or either one or both? 
A. Both. 
Q. Do you recall approximately when you took 
the space in the 401 Building? 
A. I do not. 
Q. At the time everything imploded, how many 
partners did you have at the fin-n, do you recall? 
A. Are you saying partners and shareholders? 
Because remember, we had both, two designations. 
Q. I want to start with just attorneys that 
had -- not in your firm name but named as partner on 
the cards, for example. 
A. I'd have to see a list of all the employees. 
We had a bunch. 
Q. Do you recall about how many attorneys you 
had working there? 
A. Approximately 70. 
Q. In the year before, do you recall how many 
you had? 
A. I do not. 
Q. So how many equity partners did you have or 
shareholders? I'm not sure of the word that we are 
using. 
A. Actual shareholders, equity shareholders 
Page 8 
were two, me arid Itti Is sso fekfl . 
Q. And evei one else  was just a partner for 
title purpoW 
A. There were shareholders for title u oses 
01.01...._-tnerlialiti5. 
1 Q. If someone was called a shareholder for 
title purposes then, did they get to receive any of 
the funds? Were they shareholders receiving money or 
s 9 they were not considered shareholders in that sense? 
i 10 MR. SCAROLA: Objection to the form of the 
' 11 question. 
12 THE WITNESS: What kind of funds are you 
13 talking about? 
14 BY MS. HADDAD: 
15 Q. In general from the firm. When you say 
1 6 equity shareholders, I understand that's you and Stu. 
17 What I'm saying is, if you had someone else that was 
1 8 named as a shareholder, why did you call them a 
1 9 shareholder as opposed to a partner? 
20 A. It was a title oflprestige and achievement. 
21 Q. So it was basically an ego thing, it had 
22 nothing really to do with the finances or hierarchy of 
23 the firm? 
24 A. They_got paid more_generally, but it did not

Q. When you were hiring and bringing in all 
2 these new attorneys, did everyone come in as a 
3 partner? 
1 A. No. 
5 Q. How did you decide who came in as a partner 
6 and who came in as an associate? 
7 A. Depended upon their level of expertise, 
8 practice, book of business. It was a decision Stuart 
9 and made together on a case-by-case basis. 
1 0 Q. So you and Stu where the -- were in charge 
11 of hiring? 
12 A. Stuart and 1 tried to consult on every 
13 hiring decision, yes. 
14 Q. Did you guys also decide salaries? 
15 A. 1 generally decided the salary and then let 
16 Stu know what] was going to do. And he would say if 
17 he thought it was okay or if he thought it was too 
18 much or too little, but 1 generally had free reign in 
19 that regard. 
2 0 Q. Did someone's book of business directly 
21 correlate to the salary that you would offer? 
22 A. That is a very broad question because it 
23 depends upon what other needs we had for that 
24 individual. 
25 Q. What do you mean by what other needs? 
Page 
A. Well, I'll give you a good example. My 
2 lawyer, Mr. Nurik, his salary was directly related to 
3 the fact that he was a great lawyer and had a solid 
4 book of business. 
5 Q. Yes. 
6 A. David Boden, on the other hand, was, as I 
7 previously testified, l don't know if you've had a 
8 chance to read the testimony, but David Boden was not 
9 only the general counsel to the law firm but he was 
1 0 also -- acted as my consigliere in a significant 
11 number of illegal operations and he was compensated 
12 significantly for that, if that helps you understand 
13 the difference. 
14 Q. It does. 
15 So, for example, when you were hiring former 
16 judges, let's use that as an example, Pedro and Julio, 
17 clearly they don't have a book of business coming in 
18 because they haven't had clients, but they may carry 
19 some sort of prestige or give some legitimacy, if you 
20 will, to the firm. How would you decide the salary 
2 1 for someone like that? 
22 A. Stu and I would discuss it. It was more a 
23 market issue than anything else, how much are judges 
24 coming off the bench getting, how much business do we 
25 think they can generate.

Q. Would you need to look at someone's book of 
business if they were coming in just solely to be a 
rainmaker for the firm prior to hiring them? 
A. I discussed it with them. There were not 
many people that I recall that 1 actually looked at 
their numbers. Once David Boden was working for me 
had him check people's numbers, but I rarely looked. I 
took most people's words for what they were 
generating. 
Q. My recollection is, you were always looking 
to bring in more people, to hire more people, some of 
us were somehow able to resist you while others were 
not.  How would you decide  who ou were lookin at to 
bring into your firm?  
A. We were trying to develoate 
side of the law finn, we were try_i_p_g_t2leystos_mi 
talent, real practice groups.  I mean, Brad is a  
perfect 
You know, it was our hope that, you know 1_____j__2s2v_as_g2k)_g 
to be one of the people to actually in s 
rescue the firm because he had a practice groupb_al 
could generate substantial income. You know, on the 
le_gitimate side that's what we were trying to do, we 
were trying to find the best and the brightest. 
Q. 0122.WLtLEp_e_c_f_toj_12L-in_gill_Esople that

you thought could bring a book of business, you just 
said Brad for exam le that he had a legjtimats 
_a-Lc:fiee group with a good book of business. How did 
you know that?  
A. Everyone in the tort world that I had spoke 
yoke extremelyjijalysirad no_only_peopIe 1  
already had working for me but other people that knea.. 
him. He wa_s_ysi_y_-_-cm_y_e_ghighly recommended to 
us. 
Q-
A. 
Like who, for example? 
We wanted him in there. We were trying to 
develop a significant tort group and we thought that 
he'd be a great part of it. 
Q. Who besides Russ told you that about Brad? 
A. It would have been other people in the tort 
group. I don't want to guess, Tonja, as to which 
other people told me, but it was -- well more than 
Russ. 
Q. Was it people within --
A. Might have been people in politics that 1 
talked to that knew him because we had significant 
input at the gubernatorial level with regard to tort 
reform and the like, and there were people there who 
knew who Brad was. It was more than one person that 
told us that.

1 Q. Okay. When you were looking at peoale to 
2 bring in as ou La_i_d. Your 
3 fin-n had a very unique area of practice and had a very 
4 unique environment to which to work. How did you know 
5 or  how did you come to decide what people may or may 
6 not fit into that? 
7 A. Okay. Hang on one second. I think1921 just 
8 accidentally misstated my testimony, 
9 Iwas not bringing the people in to  
1 0 legitimize the law firm. l_was bringing them in to  
11 the legitimate side of the law firm. The bulk of the 
12 law fi=ct plc the lack of financial success, was  a 
13 large group of ve honest, hard workin la ers 
14 ..5iLig.12_do their best in difficult economic 
15 conditions. There were some that were obviously not 
16 legitiinate. And the way I decided to bring people in, 
17 again, it's really everything I just told you. Are 
18 you looking for how I brought people into the Ponzi 
19 scheme? 
2 0 Q. No, right now I'm just asking about the firm 
21 because, as I said, it's a very unique way in which to 
22 practice and a very unique workplace environment with 
23 politics and restaurants and parties at your home and 
24 things of that nature. I'm asking, personality wise, 
25 other than the book of business, how did you decide on 
Page 14 
people that would be a good fit? 
2 A. I looked for people that were outgoing, that 
3 had the type of personality. On the legitimate side 
4 of the business, people that had charisma that were --
5 that could go out and hustle and try to develop a book 
6 of business if they didn't have it. And as one of the 
7 50 percent of the shareholders of the firm] was 
8 trying to hire people I wanted to work with. 
9 Q. Okay. When you would see people from whom 
10 you would offer jobs, for example, as you mentioned 
11 earlier with Brad and his practice, if somebody stated 
12 that people told you that he was a good lawyer, did 
13 you need to see him in action, so to speak, prior to 
14 your deciding to hire them or would you just take 
15 people at their word for it? 
16 A. Some of people I saw in action; he wasn't 
17 one of them. Steve Osber is an excellent example of 
18 that. I hired Steve after he was beating the living 
19 daylights out of me on the other side of a case. And 
20 I certainly would ask around about the people. But 
21 the people that I trusted -- see, I can't remember. I 
22 think Gary Farmer was working for me before Brad, and 
23 if I'm not mistaken he would have been one of the 
24 people that I went to with regard to Brad because we 
25 were really developing that whole tort group around 
Page 15 
that time with Fanner and Fistos and Jaffe and 
2 Mr. Edwards. 
Q. Do you know where Mr. Edwards was working 
when you first learned of him? 
A. I don't recall whether he was working for 
someone or had his own practice, I don't recall. 
Q. When did you first learn about Brad? 
A. I don't remember the time frame. 
9 Q. Do you recall when you first met with him 
10 regarding a job? 
11 A. No. The easiest way to figure that out is 
12 to go look at his personnel file, it will have the 
13 notes saying when he met with me the first time. 
14 Q. You don't have any recollection of your 
15 first meeting with him? 
16 A. No. As you know, I was hiring people left 
17 and right and I was also unfortunately very busy doing 
18 things I shouldn't have been doing, so I don't have a 
19 specific recollection of when I hired him. I barely 
20 have a specific recollection of when I hired me. 
21 Q. But you did, in fact, meet with him? 
22 A. I'm certain I met with him before I hired 
23 him. I can't imagine -- although I did hire people 
24 without meeting them. I did hire people based on 
25 other people's word, if they were people within the

firm that I trusted. Because] always said, I had a 
very simple, you lie or die by what you are telling 
me. If you are telling me this guy is good and he's 
not good, that's on you, it's going to hurt your 
income. So used to tell my partner, people that 
were recommending people to me, don't sell me a bill 
of goods just to get somebody in here because if you 
do that it's going to come back on you, it's going to 
affect your income and your ability to grow in the 
firm. So with that admonishment, I might have very 
well hired someone sight unseen based upon what 
someone else told me. 
Q. But you did meet with Brad you say before he 
came in to work? 
A. Now that I'm saying it out loud, I think I 
did but really I'm guessing. I don't have a specific 
recollection of meeting him. 
Q. Do you recall if you knew that he had worked 
as an assistant state attorney for a few years prior 
to doing tort litigation? 
A. I don't recall that one way or the other. 
Q. So you wouldn't have asked Howard Scheinberg 
or anybody about him before he came to work there? 
A. I can't say that I wouldn't have asked 
because, like I said, I might have asked. But

unfortunately, you are taking a little tiny spot out 
2 of a very, very busy time period in my life and in the 
3 life of the firm, so I can't tell you one way or the 
4 other. 
5 Q. I know you had a lot going on, I'm just 
6 trying to see if you remember anything specific about 
7 this. 
8 Do you recall what salary you had offered 
9 Brad to come join the firm? 
10 A. I do not. You have to just try to 
11 differentiate that what I knew then is a lot different 
12 than what] know now so ... 
13 Q. Meaning? 
14 A. Obviously meaning that at the point in time 
15 that I was hiring him or maybe a year after, I would 
1 6 be able to tell you what I was paying him, but now 
17 it's insignificant. I don't remember how much I was 
18 paying him. 
19 Q. Did ou learn about his book of business or 
2 0 know what kind of cases he was bringing in prior to  
21 hiring him? 
22 A. I do know that he -- I discussed either with 
23 Russ, well, I know with Russ, and perhaps some other 
24 people,1 knew about the Epstein case. 
25 Q. What did you know about it? 
A. 
2 otentiall si ificant value against an extreme] 
3 collectible pedophile, for lack of a better word. 
4 Q. So was that case your rimaty motive in 
5 bringing Brad into the firm? 
6 A. I doubt it. I mean, I can't tell you one 
7 way or the other, but I doubt that I would bring him 
8 in .ust for one case because what if the case  fails, 
9 then I'm stu 1Qsa_vithl_amgr who can't do anything, 
10 you know. 10 
11 I'm not saying, Brad, that you couldn't do 11 
12 anything, I'm just saying that if I only relied on one 12 
13 case, then if I bring a lawyer in for one case and one 13 
14 case only, what do I do with him when the case is 19 
15 over. 15 
1 6 Q. How did you know that this case would be a 16 
17 collectible case then? 17 
18 MR. SCAROLA: I'm going to object to the 18 
1 9 form of the question because it misstated the prior 19 
2 0 testimony. The prior testimony was not that it was a 20 
21 collectible case but that it was a case against a 21 
22 extremely collectible pedophile. 22

A.  Epstein was a billionaire. 
Q. Okay. Did you know anything about the 
legitimacy or  illegitimacy of the, claims  prior to 
knowing he was a billionaire? 
A. I knew what I was told. I didn't check it 
out m self, but I trusted the people that told me. 
Q. And who told you? 
A. Tile_aily_p=1=e_i_niyiLL1Lssimingil 
with, as I sit here todayL is Russ Adler. But if 
Farmer and Jaffe and those guys were with me at the 
time, I likely would have discussed it with them as 
well. 
Q.  So were you aware of this case before lot,t 
made an offer to Brad to join the firm? 
A. Yes. 
Q. You said you didn't --I don't want to 
misquote you. You said you heard about it from other 
people, but you didn't do anything to know that 
personally. Was that before you made the offer of 
employment? 
A. I made the offer of employment based upon 
what other people had told me about Brad. 
Q. About Brad and his book of business or just 
Brad and his legal skills? 
A. Okay. When I say Brad, I mean Brad and his 
Page 20 
book of business and his legal skills. 
Q. Okay. 
A. And his ability to generate business in the 
future. 
Q. You stated that you believed that you first 
heard about these cases from Russ and then perhaps 
from Brad. Once Brad was at the firm, did you keep up 
with these cases, these Epstein cases? 
MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, I'm going to 
object to the form of the question. It is an 
inaccurate reflection of the prior testimony. It has 
no predicate. There was no reference about having 
heard about these cases from Brad. The names 
mentioned were Adler, possibly Fanner, possibly 
Jaffe.

Q. DJELBJaLsialts ri a j. tiasluip , 
you've already testified you already knew about these 
Epstein cases, correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. How did you kegobreast of these cases? 
A. I didn't. 
Q. You didn't know anything about them? 
A. I didn't say I didn't know anything. I said 
I didn't keep track of it.

1 Q. You didn't keep track of it? 
2 A. I did not keep track of it. From time to 2 
3 time Russ and the other guys in the tort group would 
9 tell me what was going on in certain cases, but until  
5 I made a decision to utilize that file for an illegal 
6 purpose related to something illegal that  I was doinl 
..._ 
7 along with my co-conspirators, I just assumed my 
8 layers were going_to work the case and eventually it 
9 would hopefully work out well for the law firm. 9 
1 0 Q. At your firm, when e-mails would go out to 10 
1 1 attorneys at RRA or all attorneys at RRA, were you 11 
12 part of that e-mail group? 12 
1 3 A. You are talking about all staff? I 13 
1 9 Q. No, all it says is attorneys at RRA. 14 
1 
1 5 A. It's the e-mail group attorneys? 15 
16 Q. Yes. 16 
1 7 A. Yes, I'm a part of that e-mail group. 17 
1 8 Q. And I appreciate that you were very busy and 18 
1 9 may not have read all of them, but you did receive 19 
20 those e-mails when they would go around? 20 
2 1 
A. Yes, and I tried my best to read them. 21 
Q. Okay. At what point did you decide to use 1 
22 22 
23 this case to further your Ponzi scheme? 23 
24 A. I don't remember the date, but I can give 129 
25 you the circumstances, if you'd like. 125 
Page 22 
1 Q. Please do. 
2 A. The Ponzi scheme was running  very low on  
3 capital. My co-conspirators and I needed to find a 
4 new feeder fund, new investment sources. We had a 
5 couple of very large, significantly wealthy potential 
6 investors out there. I was looking for something that 
7 would have been very attractive. We had had a lot of 
8 inquiry during the due diligence period with these 
9 people that were doing due diligence on the putative 
10 cases that we were selling. And when I thou ht about 
11 the E stein case, realizing that it was a substantial 
12 actual file in the office2I camtjijde 
13 that if I created a fake confidential settlement 
1 4 circling around -- based upon this actual case, they 
15 would be able to increase the Leveloiskuililigeno. 
16 thatl was able to offer to my p_plentiajinvestors. 
17 Q. How did you know this was a substantial file 
18 in your office at that time? 
19 A. Again, through the people I spoke to in the 
20 office. 
21 Q. Such as who? 
22 A. Again, same people, Adler, Farmer, Jaffe, 
23 Fistos. 
24 Q. You never spoke to Brad about this case?

interaction --
Sorry, Tonja, I didn't mean to speak over 
you. 
tall...._<,12.112s=1_e_i_I the finn if 
the are honest with ou, they'll tell you m 
interaction was far more significant with Russ Adler, 
probably  more so because he was a co-conspirator of 
mine. My interaction  yy.id_i_Ru_-..E.e2Le_rly 
many, many percents over my interaction with Brad, and 
then you go down the line. 1 had more interaction 
with Mr. Farmer than I did with Mr. Fistos, more 
interaction with Jaffe than I did with Mr. Edwards, 
and so on. 
Q. Russ was the head of your tort group, right? 
A. Yes. 
Q. So these cases fell under the tort group; is 
that correct? 
A. Yes, it fell under the -- fell under Russ' 
purview ultimately, yes. 
Q. And Brad was a partner at your finn during 
the time these cases were there, correct? 
A. I believe that was his title. He was either 
partner or shareholder. I don't think we had made him 
a shareholder yet. 
Q. But he wasn't coming in as an associate, 
Page 24 
correct? 
A. To the best of my recollection, no. 
Q. So you stated that you learned this case 
was -- I don't want to misquote you and listen to a 
long speaking objection, but what did you call this 
case? 
MR. SCAROLA: Who wants the quote? 
THE WITNESS: It was a substantial case 
with a -- what I perceived to be a highly collectible 
pedophile as a defendant. 
BY MS. HADDAD: 
Q. Right. How did you know at the time when 
you said these investors wanted to investigate and you 
said you were going to create a fake settlement, how 
did you know that this case was the case that you 
could use? 
A. From talking to all the people that I just 
said, Adler, Fistos, Jaffe, Farmer, Mr. Edwards, to 
the extent that I spoke to him about it. 
Q. Did you speak with Mr. Edwards about the 
case? 
A.  I don't have a specific recollection one wa 
or the other. I remember speaking to him at least 
briefly the day or the day of or the day before the 
actual investor's due diligence was going on as to 
Page 25

FRIEDMAN, LOMBARDI & OLSON 
305-371-6677 
5ed93085-0554-447f-bcdd-ca2d8fe941df 
1 what was going on. And I may have spoke to him, I 
2 know I spoke to Russ, but] may_laiLs_p_o_l_Ke to him as 
well within a couple of days jusLprior to this due 
4 dili ence because I was trying to at least et some 
5 information in my head that l could use when I was  
6 creatin this sto for the investors. 
7 Q. Scott, what's Q-task? 
8 A. Q-task is a web based software system that] 
9 had invested $7 million in. 
1 0 Q. And what was the purpose of this intemet 
11 system? 
12 A. To be able to communicate in a secure 
1 3 fashion and in a unique group fashion about specific 
1 4 files. 
1 5 Q. So forgive me, we all know I'm not good with 
1 6 the computer. That was something that would be useful 
1 7 within a law firm, why? 
1 8 A. Because it allowed you to create groups and 
I1 9 have both general and private chats, organize data in 
2 0 a very unique fashion. That was, at least to our way 
2 1 of thinking, would have been very, very helpful in the 
2 2 law firm setting with multiple practice groups. 
2 3 Q. Did you belong to any groups on Q-task? 
2 4 A. I'm certain that I did. I don't remember 
2 5 which groups I belonged to. I never got into the full 
Page 
1 and with that, with the Q-task and the e-mails, did 
someone assist you with reviewing everything and 
letting you know what was going on within the groups? 
4 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, I'm going to 
object to counsel's testimony. Object to the form of 
6 the question as leading. 
7 THE WITNESS: I really don't even 
understand the question. 
Can you try to rephrase it for me. Tonja? 
10 BY MS. HADDAD: 
11 Q. Of course, I would. 
1 2 Did you keep abreast of everything that was 
1 3 going on in every practice group or was someone 
1 4 through Q-task and e-mails, for example, or was 
15 someone giving you information keeping you posted on 
1 6 what was going on within the practice? 
17 A. Well, as part of the tort group I had a 
18 pretty good idea of what was going on there all the 
19 time just because of the significant amount of 
2 0 interaction, both legitimate and otherwise, that] had 
21 with Russ Adler, so I was probably more up-to-date on 
that group than any group other than the labor and 
employment group, again, because] had such 
significant interaction with Stu Rosenfeldt, both 
legitimately and illegitimately, so] knew what was 
6 Page 28 
1 use of it. I tried to, but again, I was very busy 
2 doing other things. But I know that Mr. Adler's group 
3 used it extensively. 
4 Q. Because it was your firm and, as you said, 
5 you invested $7 million in it, did you have the 
6 ability to access a group if you wanted to? 
A. Yes. And if1 couldn't,1 could get Russ to 
8 give me access. 
9 Q. So you didn't necessarily have to be invited 
1 0 into the Q-task group for you to be able to utilize or 
1 1 view the communications within it? 
1 2 A. No, that's not true. I actually had to be 
1 3 invited, that's what I was telling Russ to do, is to 
1 4 have me invited. 
1 5 Q. But I'm saying, the lawyers wouldn't have to 
1 6 personally invite you, you can get someone within your 
17 firm to give you access maybe without the lawyers 
1 8 knowing? 
1 9 A. No, I think it might have had a, quote, 
2 0 unquote, confidential, super secret viewing 
2 1 capability, but I don't recall it having that, and I'd 
22 have no need to utilize that. Just invite me into the 
23 group and let me see what's going on. 
24 Q. Okay. I know that you are or were a very 
25 hands-on person within certain of the practice groups 
Page 27 
going on in that group. 
I tried, as best as I could, given my time 
constraints, to stay on top of what was going on, you 
know, throughout the firm. But] relied on other 
people like Debra Villegas and Irene Stay and David 
Boden, Les Stracker to the lesser extent, to monitor 
7 what was going on in the different practice groups and 
keep me up to speed. 
Q. Was there audio and video surveillance 
0 throughout the entire firm or only within your office? 
11 A. No, through the entire office, not in the 
12 individual offices. 
13 Hang on. Not in the individual offices but 
1 4 throughout the general office space. 
Ii1 5 Q. So in 2009 how many floors did you have? 
16 A. Three, I think. 
1 17 Q. And do you recall approximately how many 
18 attorneys you had working there at that time? 
19 A. Approximately 70. 
20 Q. And when you say not the individual offices 
2 1 but the other areas, do you mean -- would that 
22 include conference rooms? 
23 A. I didn't have surveillance in the conference 
24 rooms. 
25 Q. So can you please tell me exactly where you

had audio and/or video surveillance? We'll start with 1 
audio. 
A. I don't have a specific recollection of 
every place I had video and audio, but it was in --
had it set up so that in all of the common areas, 
including our shareholder's lounge, we had -- I had 
audio and video capabilities. 7 
Q. When you say capabilities, does that mean 
you didn't always turn it on or you just turned it on 
when you felt like it? 
A. I turned it on when I felt like it, when] 11 
felt like seeing what was going on. lsometimes left 12 
the screen up becauselhad four computer screens on 
my desk, I sometimes left the screen on with the video 
of the reception area and some other general areas. 
But unlesslwanted to see what was going on or listen 
to what was going on, I didn't turn it on. It would 
have been too distracting. 
Q. Did the attorneys know that this 
surveillance existed? 
A. You can see it in the -- it wasn't hidden, 
you can see it. There were globes up in the ceiling 
all over the office. 
Q. Did you have -- you said -- you didn't 
answer this, you said you didn't recall. Did you have 
Page 30 
1 any surveillance in the conference rooms? 
2 A. No. 
3 Q. Other than the common areas you just went 
9 over, in the hallways and the reception -- did you 
5 have it in the hallways, is that a common -- do you 
6 deem that a common area? 
7 A. All the hallways pretty much with the 
8 exception of a few blind spots, I can see all the 
9 hallways. 
10 Q. And this was on all three floors? 
11 A. Yeah. For some reason I think we might 
12 have taken some space on a fourth floor, but I could 
13 be mistaken. But yes, on the three floors that we 
14 actively had a significant amount of space on,1 tried 
15 to have surveillance on all the common areas of all 
16 that space. 
17 Q. And what floor was Mr. Edwards' office on? 
18 A. I don't recall. 
19 Q. Did you have the tort group all together or 
20 was it divided up? 
21 A. Except for Adler, Adler was on with -- near 
22 me, down the hall from me. The rest of the group was 
23 all together. I think they were on -- let's see. 
24 There were people up on 22. I was on 16. He must 
25 have been on the other floor that we were building

out, because I remember building out space and I 
remember Jaffe and all those guys moving into that 
space. 
Q. If you were building up that space, do you 
recall when you put the surveillance in there? 
A. It would have been while they were building 
it out or shortly thereafter. 
Q. During 2009 it seems that you hired lots of 
former law enforcement people to work at the firm. 
Why were they people you wanted to hire? 
A. Severalfold. I had a significant amount of 
illegal activity going on with various law enforcement 
agencies throughout South Florida and hiring people 
from former law enforcement assisted me in engendering 
support and camaraderie with the law enforcement that 
I was actually utilizing in illegal activities. 
Q. So you are saying --
A. Secondarily, I wanted to have a very strong 
investigative team, ultimately, to do both legitimate 
and illegitimate things for the law firm, and hiring 
former law enforcement was the best way to do that. I 
was hoping to actually ultimately create a group. Ken 
Jenne and I had talked about that extensively. 
Q. Why did you hire Ken Jenne? 
A. Prior to Ken going to prison, he and] were 
Page 32 
very friendly and he was extremely friendly with 
someone that was very close to me, Grant Smith. 
During the time that he was down in FDC Miami,] went 
down to visit him. And after speaking to him and 
after speaking to Grant, I told him, because he was 
talking to me about how many people had turned on him 
and abandoned him. Andltold him that when he got 
out of jail that he had no worries, that] would give 
him a job. 
Q. And what --
A. And that was the primary reason -- that was 
my primary reason for hiring him. 
Q. What was it you were hiring him to do 
exactly? 
A. Ultimate the goal was to head up on 
investigative arm within RRA, within the RRA entities. 
Q. Well, while he was there, since that didn't 
happen, what was his obligation to the firm 
day-to-day? 
A. He handled firm security issues and he did 
handle overseeing certain investigative things. We 
had an alcohol and beverage group that was forming and 
he was overseeing that. He was helping me find new 
people to staff it, that kind of thing. 
Q. Did you have a lot of interaction --
Page 33 
9 (Pages 30 to 33) 
FRIEDMAN, LOMBARDI & OLSON 
305-371-6677 
5ed93085-0554-447f-bcdd-ca2d8fe941df 
1 A. He had had significant -- as you know, he 
2 also had significant political connections and 
3 everyone who is not living under a rock knows] was 
4 doing everything I could to garner significant 
5 political power. 
6 Q. I think many people miss your parties. 
7 But, with respect to Mr. Jenne and his 
8 political connections, were you hiring him to utilize 
9 him with respect to any of the police department 
1 0 investigations? You had stated earlier you had 
1 1 dealings with police departments. I don't want --
1 2 again, I don't want to put words in your mouth. You 
1 3 said you had dealings going on with various police 
1 4 agencies? 
1 5 A. I had -- I mean, we had a criminal defense 
1 6 section in the law firm, so we had legitimate dealings 
1 7 with law enforcement. But I also had significant 
1 8 illegitimate things with law enforcement that had 
1 9 nothing to do with Ken Jenne. 
2 0 Q. And how about with respect to former FBI 
2 1 agents you were hiring? 
2 2 A. They were all people that were operating in 
2 3 a legitimate fashion within the law firm. 
2 4 Q. In what role was that? 
2 5 A. The investigative roles and the alcohol 
Page 34 
beverage roles and anything else Ken or other staff 
2 could think of to have them do. 
Q. Let's talk about the investigative roles for 
4 a minute. 
5 What kind of investigations were these teams 
6 running? 
7 A. I do not know. You have to speak to lawyers 
8 that were actually utilizing them. I put it out there 
9 and Ken put it out there, that they were available to 
1 0 lawyers in the fin-n for use like in-house 
1 1 investigators. And what people did with them 
1 2 ultimately was up to them. 
1 3 Q. Were they on salary or were their costs and 
1 4 fees associated with utilizing them within a specific 
1 5 practice group? 
1 6 A. They were all on salary with me. The 
1 7 ultimate goal was to have it as a separate entity that 
1 8 could bill the law firm and have the clients at least 
1 9 defray some of the cost. I don't recall whether or 
2 0 not we ever got to that level or not. 
2 1 Q. With all that in-house police action, why 
2 2 did you have police security surrounding you all the 
2 3 time? 
2 4 A. I guess the best answer was I was paranoid, 
2 5 but 1 mean -- that's the simple answer to it. You 
Page 35 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
know, having -- there were mixed reasons. For 
example,1 -- are you talking about my Fort Lauderdale 
police detail? 
Q. Yes. You had it at the office and at your 
home, correct? 
A. Yeah. There's a myriad of facts that 
motivated me to do that. One was that I really wanted 
the security for the office. Two was, I was paranoid 
and this is in no particular order. Three was the 
1 0 Melissa Lewis murder that shook the entire law firm 
1 1 and shook me terribly. I didn't want that to ever 
1 2 have to happen again. And four was, I wanted -- the 
1 3 more law enforcement you have around, the 
1 4 more legitimacy it adds to you and your appearance to 
15 the community. So there were a multitude of reasons. 
16 I mean, I hired certain law enforcement to 
17 work for me that were just friends of mine that 
1 8 were -- that needed additional money, so] wanted to 
19 make sure that they had money, both guys that did the 
20 illegal stuff for me and guys that didn't do anything 
2 1 illegal for me. 
22 Q. Let's go back to the Epstein case and when 
23 you decided to utilize it -- to use for the investors 
24 for your Ponzi scheme. 
25 Do you recall approximately when it was that 
Page 36 
these investors were coming that you decided to use 
2 the files? 
A. My best recollection it was  in 2009, 
sometimes after April of 2009 but l don't have a 
5 specific recollection bsyoj___id that. 
6 Q. What makes you think it was after April of 
7 2009? 
A. Because, to the best of my recollection, the 
Clockwork Group came in towards the middle of 2009. 
1 0 When 1 say Clockwork, that's an umbrella term that 
1 1 use to mean the Von Allmen, AJ Discala, and other 
12 investors that came in through that feeder fund. 
13 Q. So that was around April 2009? 
14 A. No, it was after, to the best of my 
15 recollection. I mean, you can tell because all you 
1 6 have to do is look and see when the first, very first 
17 Clockwork investment is. Actually, you can pinpoint 
18 it even closer. Look for the very first settlement 
19 deal that we did that was related to the E stein case, 
20 within 60 gays prior to that would have been when] 
21 was meeting with those due diligence people 30 to 
22 60 days before that. 
23 Q. _So_ all=t_LcLesige_d_t_o 
2 4 me through exactly what you did to familiarize 
25 yourself with that case.

A. ltalked to Russ Adler. I my have talked 
2 to some of the other lawyers. I flipped throgli 
3 certain boxes in the file. 
4 Q. How did you get the boxes? 
5 A. I  asked someone to bring them to me. 
6 Q. Do you know where those files were stored? 
7 A. I do not. 
8 Q. So you flipped -- sorry, please continue. 
9 Flipped through some files? 
10 A. I flipped through some files.  1 had the 
11 files in my office. The day that the investor group 
12 Ken Jenne and some others 
13 actually bring me some more of the boxes actually into 
14 my office while the investors were there. I already 
15 had some of the boxes with me. 
16 Q. You say Ken Jenne and others, who were the 
17 others to whom you are referencing? 
18 A. Idon't specifically recall who carried them 
19 in. 1 was very focused on my investors at that time. 
20 Q. Wei-e any of the lers resenvith ou 
2 1 when you were meeting with these investoD2

Q. Okay. So you had, to further your Ponzi

so that you could speak intelligently with the 
investors; is that correct? 
A. Well, sort of because  most of what 1 told 
the  investors,__aiahingLtftgtj_ns_cLe_atjma_,s I 
Tvient, 
Q. About this particular case, the Epstein 
case? 
A. Yes, from an investor -- you have to 
understand how the inner working of the Ponzi scheme 
8 
were crafted but --
Q. Please tell me then. 
A. I'm telling you -- hang on. From an 
investor's standpoint, the investor is simply looking 
for is the case believable., And once they get past 
that, is it of such case-- excuse me,  is it of such a 
nature that it is ossible to be eneratin a 
significant amount of settlement dollars. And then 
after that, t en- concern is sim_pl on the due 
diligence side of making sure we actually have the

case, there's very little an investor, at least from. 
my end, investigates into the actual case. It was 
more after having  the case exist and not carin about 
Le.aily  what was going on in the case other than a lot

Q. Well, with respect to showing them that the 
case existed and that there was a likelihood of a 
possibility of a payday at the end, how did you 
convince them of that? What did you use to convince 
them of that? 
A.  1 did two main things. One, I put the boxes 
in m office while the were there. I told them to 
pfi_c_ally_12.2)*Lat a couple of sheet 
manifest that was in the file that Russ had shown me. 
And I told them that it would be a breach of

that's what] did. I stepped out__,.....ni_pols_at

this case; is that correct? 
A. These were the legitimate fily_es. 
Q. Nothing had been created at this time for 
them to look through? 
A. I didn't add an thin to the case files. 
The case files werentemughly_themssty_e_s. 
Q. Do you know how long they were in your 
office; days, weeks? 
A. The people or the boxes? 
Q. The boxes. 
A. The boxes were in there probably a little 
more than a week. I don't have a specific 
recollection. 
Q. Okay. Did you ever go through them? 
A. Yes, I flipped through them at some point in 
time. 
Q. And what do you recall about what you saw in 
the cases? Do you remember anything?

at other things, but again,  for my purposes it was 
insignificant to me because the actual content of the 
boxes was not necessa in the sale of the fake 
settlements.  
Q. Why was the flight manifest so interesting

1 to you? 
2 A. Because of who was on it. 
3 Q. Who was on it? 
4 A. I don't recall, but I do recall saying to 
5 the investors -- I recall having a conversation prior 
6 to the investors coming in with Russ Adler and Russ 
7 had told me that Epstein had flown Bill Clinton on his 
8 plane, had flown Prince Andrew on his plane. And] 
9 don't remember whether that was on an_y_Ztheilighl 
10 manifests or not, but I left that to the investors' 
11 imagination as to what they were being told about 
12 Mr. Epstein and these other famous people that were 
1 3 cavorting with Mr. Epstein and let them look at the 
14 file. 
15 You have to understand from an investor's 
16 perspective -- hang on. From an investor's 
17 perspective the only thin that Tatters to ths 
1 8 investor is that it's a real case and that they can  
19 ysi-jk_172.t.t-eal d9lIgaare beingxaid. The fact 
20 that it was a real case was evident, I had a lot of 
bco_cs_withml_pding_rs in it and a lot of other 
22 information in it. The fact that there was real money 
23 lein aid was a fiction that was created b me and m 
24 co-conspirators everyone from bankers, to computer 
25 people. So the actual role of the case, and I want to 
Page 42 
1 make sure you understand this, the actual role of the 
2 actual physical case in the Ponzi scheme is, from my 
3 It waslust another vehicle for 
4 me. 
5 Q. After that initial meeting with the 
6 investors where they looked at the file, what happened 
7 with respect to their desire or lack of desire to 
8 invest? 
9 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. I'm going to 
10 object to the form of the question, it assumes facts 
11 not in evidence. There's been no testimony that the 
12 investors actually looked at the files, only that 
13 they were given the opportunity to look at the files. 
14 BY MS. HADDAD: 
15 Q. Was your video surveillance on when you left 
16 the investors alone in your office? 
17 A. No, no, I didn't have cameras in my office. 
18 1 didn't let people look in my office when I was in 
19 there, that would have been bad.

1 A. l went back to sellin the Ponzi dea 
Q. And did you sell it? 
3 A. I believe] did. You'd have to look at the 
4 actual settlement documents to see if I put one 
together for that, but I'm pretty sure we did. 
Q. Do you recall if the investors asked you for 
7 any additional information or any additional 
documentation? 
A. I don't recall one way or the other. 
Q. After this initial meetin with the 
y_o_t_gt this  
particular case? 
A. To whom? 
Q. To any of the attorneys working on the 
Epstein case. 
A. No. I didn't interfere in how they were 
runnia their cases. They were far more experienced 
than I was in that ty_ps...L.LiEnc. JI.t_g__n_t that ipe of 
case. Asa matter of fact, was practicing very 
little real law at this point in time. I wouldn't 
have had time to tell them or to get involved. 
Q. Did you—ever keep up with this case after 
this initial meeting with the investors? 
A. I'm certain that I talked to Russ Adler 
about it from time to time, but my main focus by this 
Page 44 
point in time in 2009 was the Ponzi scheme. 
Q. Did you try to sell this particular 
settlement to any other investors? 
A. I don't recall one way or the other. 
Q. Okay. Didiou ever have any conversations 
with an of our investors about this E stein case? 
A. I don't recall one wa or the other. 
Q. I notice there's been a privilege log 
produced with respect to e-mails. There seems to be 
10 quite a bit of communication between you and Ken Jenne 
11 with the topic being the Epstein case. Do you have 
12 any recollection what that would be about? 
13 A. I don't. As I sit here today, l don't have 
14 a specific recollection of having significant e-mail 
15 contact with Ken Jenne about the case. But if you are 
16 telling me I did, accept that, but I don't recall 
17 what it was. 
18 Q. lailisLyot._ ...ilaslitatEcillLat_nhstryou were

21 words in your mouth --.it was the legitimacy of the 
22 practice, it would bring hilsgitimate money to the 
23 practice, is that what you were hoping to do? 
24 A. Earlier when I testified I specifically 
25 testified that I personally did not look at most of

4 nothing to do with the Ponzi scheme. 
Q. During the year 2009, were there any, to 
your knowledge, any big settlements of any cases at 
RRA? 
8 A. To the best of my recollection, no. We had 
9 a dismal year. 
1 0 Q. The year 2009 was just dismal across the 
1 1 board? 
1 2 A. Some people did better than others, but yes, 
1 3 overall it was for a firm of 70 lawyers, it was 
1 4 dismal. 
1 5 Q. So there were no big wins coming into the 
1 6 firm as far as a financial windfall other than from 
1 7 your other businesses? 
1 8 A. The only significant capital coming into the 
1 9 firm was money my co-conspirators and I were stealing. 
2 0 Q. Was there any particular practice group that 
2 1 you can remember that had a particularly non-dismal 
22 year in 2009? 
2 3 A. Mr. Nurik had a good year. 
2 4 Q. Do you recall what the gross revenue was 
2 5 from legitimate sources in 2009? 
Page 
1 A. It was somewhere between eight and 
2 $10 million, probably right around the nine million 
3 mark. 
4 Q. Do you know what your --
5 A. On its best day. 
6 Q. What was your overhead for salaries in 2009, 
7 do you recall? 
8 A. I don't have a clue. 
9 Q. Was it more than you brought in 
1 0 legitimately? 
1 1 A. With what I was paying in salaries, I'm --
12 mean, I'd be guessing. If it wasn't more than, it was 
1 3 certainly close to it. 
14 Q. That's just salary, that's not talking about 
1 5 anything else, rent, overhead, things of that nature? 
1 6 A. That's correct. 
17 Q. Who was paying for the investigations of the 
1 8 cases that were going on in 2009, the deposition 
1 9 costs, the filing of complaints, and things of that 
2 0 nature? Where did that money come from from your 
21 fin-n? 
22 A. It varied from case to case. 
23 Q. For the tort group? 
24 A. It was fronted by the law firm for the most 
25 part.

Q. For the most part. 
What wasn't fronted by the law firm? 
A. I recall there being a couple of agreements 
that various tort lawyers had with certain clients 
where they were going to assist in helping to pay the 
costs. All the other costs would have been paid by 
the law firm, both through legitimate and illegitimate 
means. 
Q. So when you say by illegitimate means, 
where would the illegitimate means money come from? 
A. It came from the Ponzi scheme, and all the 
tentacles of the Ponzi scheme, other illegal activity. 
Q. Such as? 
A. Things I was doing with law enforcement, 
things] was doing in politics, things that I was 
doing with organized crime, things I was doing with 
politicians, judges, other lawyers, bankers, business 
people, things of that nature, I'm sure there's more. 
Q. Do you recall if any of these Epstein  cases 
underwent significant investigation while the cases  
were at your firm? 
A. _I'd be guessing.  1 don't remember. 
Q. There was a meeting in 2009, July of 2009, 
and it appears from the e-mail communications that it 
was for everyone in the firm to attend and it was 
Page 48 
regarding the Epstein case. In fact, there was an 
Epstein conference room that was reserved for it. 
Were you present at that meeting? 
A. I may have been. 
Q. Do you recall? 
6 A. I don't recall one way or the other. 
7 Q. You don't recall it. 
Do you recall anything about the Epstein 
case in July of 2009? 
A. I do not. Do you have something that might 
refresh my recollection? 
MS. HADDAD: Can we just take a five-minute 
break right now? 
THE WITNESS: Sure. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Thank you. 
MS. HADDAD: Thanks. 
[Short recess taken.] 
BY MS. HADDAD: 
Q. Scott, I was asking you before we took the 
break about a meeting with respect to the Epstein 
cases. There was a 159-page privilege log filed, 
which I'm sure you don't have and are not aware of. 
But in it there are many, many e-mails to both 
attorneys at RRA, yourself, and Mr. Nurik regarding 
the Epstein litigation. And all this resolved in July

1 of 2009 about the Epstein meeting and some additional 
2 investigation into the Epstein case. 2 
3 Does that refresh your investigation as to 
4 when you met with the investors in the 
5 Di scal a/CI ockwork Group? 
6 A. It does not. The best thing to refresh my 6 
7 recollection as to when I met with them would be to 7 
8 see the deal documents. 
9 Q. Okay. I unfortunately don't have those. 9 
10 Do you recall if you took Discala and his 10 
1 1 other investors to a football game in 2009? 1 1 
1 2 A. Sure.] did. 12 
1 3 Q. Okay. Would that be around the time you 13 
1 4 were trying to get them to invest in the case? 1 4 
1 5 A. It would have been around the time I was 15 
1 6 trying to get them to invest in general. It's may 1 6 
1 7 have been around the time that I was showing them the 17 
18 Epstein file. 18 
1 9 Q. Did you show them any files other than the 19 
20 Epstein file? 20 
21 A. I may have. don't have a specific 21 
2 2 recollection one way or the other. 22 
23 Q. You testified earlier that you had over a 23 
2 4 dozen boxes brought to your office that were related 24 
2 5 to the Epstein case. 25 
Page 50 
MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, counsel. Counsel, 
2 there has been no such testimony. 
3 BY MS. HADDAD: 
4 Q. You said there were several boxes brought to 
5 your office by different people. You don't recall who 
6 that is; is that correct? 
7 A. Yes, I had some boxes already in my office 
8 and I had Ken Jenne and some other people bring some 
9 others. I don't remember how many boxes. 
1 0 Q. Was it more than three? 
1 1 A. Sure, it was more than three boxes, yes. 
12 Q. Was it more than 10? 
1 3 A. I don't believe so, no. 
1 4 Q. You stated that you looked -- I don't want 
1 5 to put words in your mouth. What did you look at 
1 6 specifically in that case? 
1 7 A. Other than looking at the flight manifest 
1 8 that Russ Adler told me to look at, I have no specific 
1 9 recollection as to what I looked at in that file. 
2 0 Q. Do you know if there was more than one case 
2 1 being prosecuted by your office against Mr. Epstein? 
22 A. To the best of my recollection there were --
2 3 it was multiple plaintiffs. 
2 4 Q. Okay. Do you recall if those cases were  
2 5 pending in state or federal court?  
Page 51 
A. I  don't recall.  
Q.  Did you check? 
A. _1 don't remember one way or the other. It., 
was insignificant to me.  
Q. Well, then explain to me. You testified 
earlier that what was important to the investors to 
see is that there was a real case, correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. What did you look at or show them -- what 
did you look at, first of all, to see if it was, in 
fact, a real case? 
A. I knew it was a real case. 
Q. How did you know? 
A. Because my lawyers told me it was a real 
case. I believed them. 
Q. What lawyers told you that? 
A. I already told you it was a mixture of Russ 
and Jaffe and Fistos and Farmer and Mr. Edwards. I 
mean, I knew it was a real case. We had all these 
boxes, we had people really working on the file --
Q. How do you know --
A. --or they were pulling a hell of a scam on 
me. Not that I didn't deserve it but ... 
Q. How did you know, you just said you knew 
people were working really hard on this case. Who do 
Page 52 
you know was working on the case? 
A. :The only people that 1 knew for certain were  
working on the case was Brad Edwards and Russ Adler 
ervisory schtick, whatever that was. 
her than th at, I ,s12111.1m_cnow which other la ers 
..w_e_re assisting Mr. Edwards. Fdidn't get involved at 
that level.  
As far as the Ponzi scheme goes, the only  
thing] cared about, Tonia, was being„able to show the 
10 investors that this case that I was utilizing to steal  
11 ..1jignificant amount of from th m was a re 
12 case. That's all I cared about  
13 Q. That case came into your office through 
1 4 Mr. Edwards, correct? He brought it with him when he 
15 came to RRA? 
16 A. Yes. 
17 Q. He was lead counsel on the case, correct? 
1 8 A. I assume he was lead counsel. I never 
19 checked to see if he listed himself as lead counsel. 
20 Q. Do_you know if any additional complaints 
21 were filed while the case was at RRA? 
22 A. I have no idea one way or the other. 
23 Q. Did you ever instruct, in furtherance of 
24 y.291-  Ponzi scheme, Mr. Edwards or anyone in that 
25 litigation group to file additional comp?

1 A. No. 
2 Q. Who is Cara Holmes? 
3 A. Who is who? 
4 Q. Cara or Cara, C-a-r-a, Holmes? 
5 A. To the best of my recollection, she was a 
6 former FBI agent or maybe IRS agent. I don't know. 
7 She was a fon-ner federal agent. 
8 Q. Did you hire her to work for you? 
9 A. It was either IRS or FBI. 
1 0 Q. Did you hire her to work for you? 
1 1 A. Yes, I hired her at the suggestion of Ken 
12 Jenne. 
13 Q. For what purpose? 
14 A. To work in the group that he was overseeing. 
15 Q. So what did she do for RRA while she was 
1 6 there? 
17 A. I don't remember. 
1 8 Q. Did you ever mention her to your potential 
1 9 investors from the Clockwork group? 
20 A. It's a possibility because, as 1 was 
2 1 building the Ponzi scheme, I frequently referred to 
22 the fact that we had former state and federal law 
2 3 enforcement working for us and on our investigative 
2 4 teams. It added legitimacy to the Ponzi scheme. 
2 5 Q. Didn't you tell investors that she could 
Page 54 
1 hack into a computer as part of her skills? 
2 A. I certainly may have. Itold the investors 
3 a whole host of lies about what was going on about 
1 with case and what people could do and did do. 
5 Q. Did you ever personally utilize Cara Holmes' 
6 skills in any of your cases? 
7 A. I don't remember. 
8 Q. Were you handling any cases during the 2009? 
9 A. I was overseeing cases in 2009, but my 
10 involvement was mostly supervisory. I was handling 
11 very little that was legitimate at that point in time. 
1 2 Q. Were you legitimately, when I say 
13 legitimately, were you invited into Q-task on any 
1 4 particular cases that you can recall? 
15 A. I'm certain I was. I don't recall one way 
16 or the other. 
17 Q. Do you recall if you were involved in 
18 Mr. Epstein's case on Q-task? 
19 A. I may very well have been, but don't have 
20 a specific recollection one way or the other. 
21 Q. Do you know who invited you in? 
22 A. 1 have no idea if] was invited in. And if 
23 1 was invited in, I have no idea who invited me. 
24 Q. Once you decided to use this case in your

1 case or any communications --
A. I may have. 
Q. Do you recall when that --
A. I may have. 
Q. Do you recall when that may have happened? 
A. I do not. 
Q. Do you recall the first time you looked at 
the flight manifest to which you referenced earlier? 
A. Prior to the investors coining in. I don't 
10 remember the date. 
11 Q. Did you instruct anybody, to further your 
12 Ponzi scheme, to investi ate or check into an one 
13 whose name was listed on the flight manifest? 
14 A. I may have, but with this clarification. If 
15 I instructed someone to look into somethin•, I did it 
16 with2t-son _g(nowin that I was involved  in a 
17 Ponzi scheme or that what they were  doing was illegal  
18 and it was just to et in additional information to 
19 help with2Lay sale  of the fake settlements. 
20 Q. So it was to further your --
21 A. Ii ,.(ed -- I may have 
22 asked someoneIo_gstiLnn, 
23 bt_lt_alLiI1_iere Lolai,Islon't re allsgdn 
24 anyone to do anything on the file that was for the 
25 jaiEp_o_se of furtherhydhe Ponzi scheme, other than 
Page 56 
perhaps getting me a piece of information that I 
needed. 
Q. I'm going TO try to refresh your 
4 recollection as to whether or not you attended those 
meeting in July of 2009. And it appears that in 
between the dates of July 22nd, 2009 and July 24th, 
2009, there was a number of communications through 
e-mail by and between yourself, Mr. Adler, Brad 
Edwards and Ken Jenne regarding an Epstein meeting 
that was going to be taking place. Do you remember 
that at all? 
A. I think what you are referring to, and I'm 
not certain, but I think that what you are referring 
to is me making sure that the file was in the 
condition in which I wanted it at the time the 
investors were coming in. I don't think it had 
anything to do with the actual functioning of the 
Epstein case. I think it had to do with my 
illegitimate purpose. That's the best of my 
recollection, but if you have documents or something 
that you can show me, that would be helpful. 
Q. We are not privy to all of the e-mails 
because they've been alleged as privileged or work

July 22nd and 23rd there were numerous e-mails sent 
about the meeting. It was almost an all-hands-on-deck 
type meeting where everybody needed to attend. It was 
labelled the Epstein meeting with an Epstein 
conference room reserved. 
A. Yes. 
Okay. What's your question and I will tell 
you. 
MR. SCAROLA: First I'm going to object to 
counsel's testimony, but let's hear the question. 
BY MS. I-I.ADDAD: 
Q. The question is, does that refresh your 
recollection as to whether or not this meeting took 
place? 
A. To the best of my recollection, I actually 
had introduced some of the investors to some of the 
people working on the Epstein case, and that is likely 
the meeting that you are referring to. But for the 
life of me, I don't have a specific recollection of 
It. 
Q. But it could be the meeting where you 
introduced the Epstein litigation team to your Ponzi 
investors? 
MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, I'm going to 
object to the fon-n of the question. It misstates the 
Page 58 
1 prior testimony. It has no predicate. 
2 BY MS. HADDAD: 
3 Q. That could have been the meeting in which 
4 you introduced the Ponzi investors to people working 
5 on the Epstein case? 
6 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, counsel. The 
7 testimony was that there may have been a meeting at 
8 which investors may have been introduced to some 
people working on the Epstein file. And your efforts 
continuously to mischaracterize the prior testimony 
are highly improper. I object. 
BY MS. HADDAD: 
Q. Scott, did you or did you not say that you 
introduced some of the investors to some of the 
lawyers on the Epstein case? 
A. No, I actually said, Tonja, that I may have. 
I have a recollection that I may have based upon you 
just refreshing my recollection, but I just.do rt_o_t 
IsIns_ratle....02.22-. This was, in the 
scheme of what I was doing, insioificant. I was 
_s_i_mlyjaing_t_as..s..t.a1._)lish to th.5,,intors that this 
was a real case, with real potential,with real 
lawyers working on it. Other than that,  it was of no 
interest to me.  
Q. How else would you convince them? You've

mentioned letting them look through the litigation 
boxes, you've mentioned the meeting. What other way 
would you have convinced them that it was a real case? 
A. I mentioned letting them look at boxes, what 
they did when I was out  of the office, that's --
don't know because I couldn't see what they were 
doing. Number two,] may have introduced them to 
people in the office. Number three, I'm certain that 
.A2LIten ht the boxes to my office I 
roduced them to whoever was ca in thej19_Les. 
And number four the rest of it would have been all 
.s_tultea_t_e_dinnation because,again, it 
was the sale of something that didn't exist. This was 
not settlin There was no real settlement mone 
There were no real settlement documents. 
manufactured I think, the actual plaintiff, because I  
don't recall even knowing the plaintiffs real name or 
if I did it was of no significance tome. 
Q. How would you have manufactured a 
plaintiffs name, would you have created additional 
documents to further your Ponzi scheme using 
Mr. Epstein as the defendant? 
A. No. 
Q. How would you --
A. The name 'um on the 
Page 60 
Eap 
Q. Would they have already seen the documents 
at that point? 
A. I can't tell you one way or the other what 
they had seen, because I don't know what they actu_ally 
looked at. 
Q. Forgive me, you've now confused me so I'm 
just going to ask you for some clarification. 
You used a lsitimate _case and crssatec_Lf.a,le 
10 settlement documents, correct, in the simplest sense? 
11 A. If this culminated in an actual sale of a 
12 ettlementthentheanswerises. 
13 Q. So it was a real case with a real plaintiff 
14 and real defendant, just a fake settlement document? 
15 A. No. Let me see if I can clarify this for 
16 you. Over 90 percent of the settlements that I sold, 
17 the fake settlements, were completely fictitious? 
18 --Q. Right. 
19 A. _lysy§..122..allssi_g_Tenta esittemx_vers_

,was totally geared toward sim 1 ettin the investor 	7 
money into the Ponzi scheme. 
Q. Were you aware that the day after this 	9 
tool_s_place July 24th, 2009, a new federal 	1 0 
.meeting _on complaint was filed ag2jm.LERsIsin with one of the 	1 1 
same plaintiffs that was already pending in state 	1 2 
court? 	13 
A. I don't know that I was aware of that or 	14 
not. If they were filing it, someone may have told 	1 5 
me. I don't recall one way or the other. 	1 6 
Q. Did you ask anyone to file it to further 	1 7 
your Ponzi scheme 	1 8 
A. No I don't remember doin that. 	1 9 
Q. Do you recall any situation where you -- 	2 0 
A. You do realize -- Tonja, hang on. I just 	21 
want to make sure this record is clear. Other than 	22 
Russ Adler, the ps_o_ple that were involved in the 	2 3 
E stein case had absolutel othin to do with the 	24 
Ponzi scheme. 
Page 62 
1 Q. Directlyy 
2 A. Or indirectl They had nothin to do with 
3 it 
4 Q. Yet the file was used for you to further 
5 your Ponzi scheme. I'm not saying that they gave it 
6 to you to use for the Ponzi scheme, I'm asking, you 
7 used their case. I'm not -- the question is you used 
8 the case? 
9 A. I took advantage of some good, innocent 
1 0 people for my own and nty_s_oLcir_al2f:_s_illegal 
1 1 purposes. Mr. Edwards is one of them, and for that  I 
1 2 am sorry, Brad.  
13 Q. Did you ask anyone involved in the Epstein 
1 4 case to file a federal complaint? 
1 5 MR. SCAROLA: Objection, repetitious. 
1 6 THE WITNESS: Without seeing a document, 
17 Tonja, I can't tell you one way or the other. I 
1 8 don't want to -- I do not want to guess. If you have 
1 9 an e-mail where I'm saying to someone, file a federal 
2 0 case, then obviously I did. But I have no specific 
2 1 recollection of that. 
22 BY MS. HADDAD: 
23 Q. You do have a document with you, it's marked 
2 4 for you, it's Bates stamped. It begins at EP 081 and 
25 goes through through 264. 
Page 63 
A. Hold on one second. 
Okay. What number am I looking at? 
Q. It's a very large document. It's begins 
with Bates Stamp Number 081 and ends with 264. 
A. It's in the computer, hold on a second. 
I have that in front of me. 
Q. Do you see the date on that complaint 
stamped? 
A. I do. 
Q. And there's -- give me one second, Scott, 
sorry. 
What was the date that complaint was filed? 
A. What's the last page of the complaint, 
what's the Bates number? 
Q. The last page is 234. I'm sorry, 263 would 
be the last page of the complaint. 
[The Complaint referred to was marked for 
identification as Defendant's Exhibit 11 
MR. SCAROLA: You may want to call his 
attention to the filing stamp on the first page. 
MS. HADDAD: I did. I guess he didn't hear 
MC. 
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. 
MS. HADDAD: It's stamped on the first 
page.

THE WITNESS: Hang on, the complaint is 
dated July 24th, 2009. It was entered onto the 
docket on July 27th, 2009. 
MR. SCAROLA: Do you have another question? 
MS. HADDAD: 1 thought he was still looking. 
Scott, are you done looking? 
THE WITNESS: Yes, one second. 
MS. HADDAD: That's what I thought. 
THE WITNESS: No, hang on one second. It 
shows the stamp on the first page says July 24th, 
2009. The filing say electronically filed July 24th, 
2009. There's an entry onto the docket on July 27, 
2009, and the complaint is signed July 24th, 2009. 
That's all the dates I have. 
BY MS. HADDAD: 
Q. Okay. And back on Bates Stamp Page Number 
263, who's the attorney that filed this complaint? 
A. I don't know if that's his signature, but 
the name is Brad Edwards. 
Q. Okay. And does that e-mail --
A. With the squiggle on top of it. 
Q. And does that e-mail address look like the 
correct e-mail address for RRA? 
A. It is. 
Q. So that is, in fact, a legitimate e-mail

address from your firm; is that correct? 
2 A. Yes. 
3 Q. And were you filing any cases back in 2009 
4 in federal court? Do you remember how PACER works? 
5 MR. SCAROLA: Which question would like 
6 answered? 
7 THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
8 MR. SCAROLA: Objection, compound. 
9 BY MS. HADDAD: 
1 0 Q. Do you remember how PACER worked when you 
1 1 were filing a case, Scott? 
1 2 A. I actually never actually did the actual 
1 3 electronic filing procedure. I had people that did 
1 4 that. 1 knew that we could file electronically. 
1 5 Q. Do you know the purpose of your using your 
1 6 e-mail address when you were filing electronically in 
17 federal court? 
1 8 A. I guess so you can get a receipt, but I have 
1 9 no idea. 
20 Q. Did you ever receive an e-mail from federal 
2 1 court in your e-mail address that showed that a 
2 2 document had been filed with the stamps that you see 
2 3 on the top of that one? 
2 4 MR. SCAROLA: Counsel, are you 
2 5 attempting --
Page 66 
THE WITNESS: I don't know one way or the 
2 other. 
3 MR. SCAROLA: Are you attempting to 
9 establish that that complaint was filed in federal 
5 court by Brad Edwards? 
6 MS. HADDAD: I'm asking him if he recalls 
7 the way it's drafted and why. 
8 MR. SCAROLA: Just ask your question. 
9 MS. HADDAD: I'm asking a question. If you 
10 have any objection, please lay it on the record. 
11 MR. SCAROLA: No, what] want to do is try 
12 to save some time. If what you are trying to 
13 establish is that Brad filed the complaint in federal 
1 4 court on July 24th and used the PACER system, you 
15 don't need to ask any more questions about that, it 
16 happened. 
17 MR. GOLDBERGER: We appreciate that, but 
18 when we depose you we'll ask you that question. But 
19 we are deposing Rothstein right now so let her ask 
2 0 her questions. Don't do this speaking stuff, let her 
21 ask the questions, okay? 
22 MR. SCAROLA: Maybe. 
23 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. Go ahead, Tonja. 
24 BY MS. HADDAD: 
25 Q. Scott, did you ever get e-mails like that

1 from federal court? 
2 A. I'm certain I did, Tonja. 1 don't have a 
3 specific recollection of getting the one pertaining to 
this. I don't even know if they sent it to me. I 
would imagine they'd send it back to Mr. Edwards. 
Q. The filing attorney? 
A. I suspect, unless the PACER system is 
registered on my name, then maybe it comes to me, but 
I am completely guessing. 
1 0 Q. But based upon the e-mail communications of 
11 July 22nd and the meeting occurring on July 23rd, this 
12 complaint was filed the day of this meeting; is that 
13 correct? 
1 4 A. Okay. But here is the problem with your 
15 question, I don't remember whether or not there 
16 actually was a meeting. I said there may have been, 
17 and] don't have an independent recollection of this 
18 being filed. 1 do not have an independent 
19 recollection of whether I told someone to file this. 
20 And for the life of me, this I am certain of, if 1 
1 told Mr. Edwards to file a complaint in federal court, 
2 if there wasn't a legitimate reason for him to do it, 
3 he wouldn't have done it. 
4 Q. Do you recall if this federal case was filed 
5 when you decided to use the case for your Ponzi scheme 
Page 68 
and show it to your investors? 
A. It may have been filed around that time, 
because I haven't been able to establish the exact 
4 time. It also certainly may have been utilized by me 
5 to further the Ponzi scheme. Also, I don't have an 
6 independent recollection of that either. Without 
7 seeing e-mail traffic, I can't tell you one way or the 
8 other exactly what was going on at that time. 
9 Q. Well, then I'll point you to another e-mail 
which is marked as EP 001. 
MR. EDWARDS: Let me see it. 
MS. HADDAD: I sent a copy to your office. 
MR. SCAROLA: He would like to see a copy 
now. Thank you. 
[The E-mail referred to was marked for 
identification as Defendant's Exhibit 2.] 
BY MS. HADDAD: 
Q. Were you able to find it, Scott? 
A. Got it. Yes, I have it. 
Q. You have it, okay. 
You said Cara Holmes used to be an FBI 
agent, correct? 
MR. SCAROLA: No. What he said is --
THE WITNESS: FBI or IRS.

Mr. Epstein? 	1 9 
A. I do not remember. 	20 
Q. You stated earlier that you knew that 	21 
Mr. Epstein was a wealthy man. Is that a fair 	22 
statement? You called him collectible, was that 	2.3

MR. SCAROLA: He called him a billionaire 	25

8 Mr. Epstein? 
9 A. I don't remember that one way or the other.

15 that one way or the other. 
16 Q. Do you recall if you ever directed the 
17 depositions to be taken of the people who were listed

19 A. I don't recall one way or the other. I may

2 1 depositions without ever intending to take them, but I 
22 don't recall one way or the other. 
23 Q. Are you familiar with a gentleman by the 
24 name of Mr. Rodriguez, Alfredo Rodriguez? 
25 A. No. 
Page 71 
Q. Never heard that name before?

Q. Yes. 
A. It's not ringing any bells to me.

identification as Defendant's Exhibit 3.1 
BY MS. HADDAD: 
Q. Okay. I'm going to direct your attention to 
what's now Bates stamped as EP 002, which I'm sure you 
haven't seen before since you just said you didn't 
know who he was, but I'll give you a minute to look 
Page 72 
over it. 
A. This is rather long. Do you want to direct 
me to a specific portion of it? 
Q. Sure. If you look at the Page Bates Stamp 
EP 004, Paragraph 5 and 6. 
A. Okay. I read number five. 
7 Q. Would you please read number six as well? 
A. Okay. 
Q. Does this refresh your memory as to whether 
10 or not anyone ever asked you in your office about 
11 purchasing a book? 
12 A. It does not. 
1 3 Q. Do you know that the cooperating witness was 
14 an attorney who worked for you at your firm? 
15 A. I did not know that until you just said it 
16 right now. 
1 7 Q. According to Paragraph Number 5, The 
18 deposition of this Mr. Rodriguez occurred on 
1 9 July 27th, 2009; is that correct? 
20 MR. SCAROLA: Is it correct that that's 
21 what it says? I'm going to object to the form of the 
22 question, it's vague and ambiguous. 
23 BY MS. HADDAD: 
2 4 Q. That's what's listed in the federal 
2 5 complaint, correct?

A. What does it say? Say it again. 
2 Q. It says, The first deposition occurred on 
3 July 27th, correct? 
4 A. Yes. 
5 Q. Some three days after the federal complaint 
6 was filed, correct, that we referenced earlier? 
7 A. That's correct. 
Q. And Paragraph 6 clearly delineates that in 
9 August 2009 a phone call was received by the 
1 0 cooperating witness that explained that this 
11 Mr. Rodriguez had a list of other purported victims or 
12 contact information for people who Mr. Edwards could 
1 3 also potentially bring lawsuits for-- on behalf of; 
14 is that correct? 
15 A. I don't know one way or the other. You 
1 6 know, Tonja, just so this record is clear, you know, 
17 as I'm sitting here, I have a vague recollection of 
1 8 perhaps Ken Jenne corning, talking to me and telling me 
1 9 that someone in my office was going to cooperate with 
2 0 someone in this investigation. But for the life of 
21 me. I can't be certain of that. So much time has 
22 passed, but as I'm reading this, and it could be 
23 completely unrelated to this, l just want to make sure 
2 4 the record is a hundred percent clear, it's possible 
25 that Ken Jenne discussed that with me, but] don't 
Page 74 
know who it was. 
2 Q. You are testifying that you didn't know it 
3 had anything to do with the Epstein case, as you sit 
4 here now, you don't remember? 
5 A.' No, no, I don't have a specific 
6 recollection. and I want to just make sure so I answer 
7 all your questions completely, is that as I'm sitting 
8 here my recollection was refreshed that] have a vague 
9 recollection of having a conversation with Ken Jenne 
10 about the fact that someone in our office was going to 
11 cooperate as a confidential informant for some law 
12 enforcement agency, I just can't remember if it was 
13 the Epstein case or not. 
14 Q. Do you recall what you said to Mr. Jenne 
15 about that? 
16 A. No. What I just related to you is all] 
17 remember. And I'm not even sure it had anything to do 
1 8 with this. 
19 Q. Who's Wayne Black? 
20 A. Who? 
21 Q. Wayne Black. 
22 A. Sounds like the name of someone I hired, but 
23 I could be mistaken. I don't recall. 
24 Q. Okay. You don't recall ever meeting 
25 Mr. Black? 
Page 75 
1 A. I may have. I don't recall one way or the 
other. You have something that might refresh my 
recollection? 
4 Q. Do you know what he does for a living? 
A. I do know the name. Sounds familiar to me, 
but l can't recall one way or the other who he was or 
7 what he did. 
Q. Did you instruct your office to begin 
investigating Mr. Epstein's pilot or his airplanes? 
10 A. I do not recall one way or the other. 
11 Q. You did testify that the flight manifest was 
12 the one document you recall for sure looking at in 
13 Mr. Epstein's case; is that correct? 
14 A. Yes. 
15 Q. And if it did, in fact, contain the names 
16 that you are purporting that it claimed or that you 
17 knew of, that would be something that would be juicy 
18 for the investors to further your Ponzi scheme that it 
19 was a collectible case; is that true? 
20 A. I'm sorry, you have to repeat the question, 
21 Tonja. I don't understand what you just asked me. 
22 Q. If these big names were on this list, as you 
23 seem to recall they were, that would be most helpful 
2 4 to you and your Ponzi scheme investors in convincing 
25 them it was a big case, right?

A. If they were on there, or if I lied to them 
and told them they were on there, or if Adler told me 
they were on there and I repeated, all those things 
would have been helpful to the Ponzi scheme. 
Q. You stated earlier that you -- the only 
thing you looked at was the flight manifest because 
you were told to look at it. Is that still true? 
A. That's not what I testified to. I testified 
that I flipped through other parts of the file and 
that I didn't remember what I had flipped through. I 
remember looking at the flight manifest because 
Mr. Adler told me about it. 
Q. You said that you met these investors in 
your office, but there were no cameras in your office, 
correct? 
A. I didn't have cameras specifically in my 
office. 
Q. You had these investors in your office for 
this particular Epstein case? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Do you recall if it was during work hours or 
after work hours? 
A. I do not recall. 
Q. Typically when you were meeting with your 
potential Ponzi investors, did you meet them during

work hours or after work hours? 
A. Both. 
Q. Did you always meet with them in your office 
or did you do it more socially down at Bova or 
elsewhere? 
A. Both. 
Q. But with this particular case, do you recall 
meeting them at least one time in your office where 
they could look through the files? 
A. Actually, that group of investors were 
looking at a lot of different cases or at least 
multiple different cases that we were attempting to 
lure them into the Ponzi scheme utilizing, so I met 
with them on multiple occasions, both in my office and 
at restaurants. 
Q. Who is Mike Fisten? 
A. Mike Fisten was a law enforcement officer of 
some type that I hired. 
Q. Why did you hire him? 
A. 
Q. 
He was a Ken Jenne suggestion. 
And were you hiring him to start up your 
company with Mr. Jenne, as you indicated earlier? 
A. I don't recall what the purpose of hiring 
him was. It had nothing to do with what Ken Jenne was 
doing for us.

Page 78 
Q. So what did he do at IkRA? 
A. My best recollection is that he had been a 
former ADT officer and so it would reason that he 
would be working in our alcohol beverage practice that 
we were establishing. 
Q. Do you know if he ever did any work for your 
firm as an investigator? 
A. He may have. I don't have a specific 
recollection one way or the other. 
Q. Did you ever speak to the press about the 
Epstein case? 
A. I don't have a recollection one way or the 
other. 
Q. Did you ever have Kip utilize the Epstein 
case to put any publicity or spin out there with 
respect to the case? 
A. I don't have a specific recollection of that 
one way or the other. 
Q. Did you ever instruct Brad or Russ to talk 
to the press about the case? We'll start with Brad 
then Russ. 
A. 1 do not specifically recall getting 
involved at the publicity level of that case. I don't 
have a recollection one way or the other. 
Q. 
Would that publicity have been good for your 
Page 79 I 
Ponzi scheme investors? 
A. Not really. 
Q. Would it have given more legitimacy to your 
allegation that it was a good case in which they 
should invest? 
A. In the way that I was selling the Ponzi 
settlements, it would have likely been overkill. 
Q. So did you ever instruct them not to speak 
to the press about the case? 
A. I don't recall that either one way or the 
other. 
Q. If it had gotten out there that the cases 
had not, in fact, settled, as you were claiming when 
you were selling the settlement, would that have 
hindered your case, your Ponzi investor's case? 
A. Not really because they would have no way of 
knowing if I had created a fake plaintiffs name. I 
mean, there could have been something in the news 
that -- and I don't know that there was -- there could 
have been something in the news that says none of this 
settled. And I just simply would have created a fake 
name with my co-conspirators, created a fake set of 
settlement documents and handle it that way. 
Q. Did you know where Mr. Epstein lived?• 
A. I only knew that he was from Palm Beach, 
Page 80 
other than that, no. 
Q. Okay. In 2009, did you ever have any firm 
meetings? 
A. Of any type? 
Q. Of any type, in general, firm meetings. 
A. I'm certain I did. 
7 Q. Do you recall about how many? 
A. I do not recall. 
Q. Did you ever have any partner meetings? 
10 A. Yes. 
11 Q. Do you recall how many? 
12 A. 1 do not. 
13 Q. Do you recall how many partners you had at 
14 the firm in 2009? 
15 A. I do not. 
1 6 Q. Do you recall how many fundraisers you had 
17 at your home in 2009? 
18 A. 1 do not. 
19 Q. More than 10? 
20 A. I'd be guessing, Tonja. 
21 Q. Okay. 
22 A. It's easy enough to check, there's state and 
23 federal records of all that stuff. 
24 Q. In 2009, did you still require the attorneys 
25 from your firm to attend the fundraisers you would

FRIEDMAN, LOMBARDI & OLSON 
305-371-6677 
5ed93085-0554-447f-bcdd-ca2d8fe941df 
have? 
2 A. You said still require, which would have 
3 meant that I testified --
4 Q. Sony. 
5 A. -- previously that it was requiring them. 
6 Q. Did you require attorneys at your firm to 
7 attend your fundraisers? 
A. I asked them to, I urged them to, I tried to 
9 cajole them into coming, but it wasn't an absolute 
1 0 requirement. 
1 1 Q. Do you recall between April and July of 2009 
1 2 how many fundraisers you would have had? 
13 A. I do not. 
1 4 Q. Did you have fundraisers anywhere besides 
15 your home in 2009? 
1 6 A. I probably did, but I don't recall without 
1 7 seeing the documents. If you have the invitation or 
1 8 the e-mails, that would help me. 
1 9 Q. Did you hold fundraisers at your office in 
20 2009? 
2 1 A. I may have. That wouldn't have been 
2 2 unusual, but I don't have a specific recollection. 
2 3 Q. Did you ever meet any of the plaintiffs in 
2 4 the Epstein case? 
2 5 A. I don't have a specific recollection of 
Page 82 
1 that. 
2 Q. Do you recall ever revving copies of e-mails 
3 from Mr. Jenne with respect to the plaintiffs in the 
4 case that the subject matter would say information we 
5 need to use? 
6 A. I don't recall that one way or the other. 
7 It's certainly possible. 
8 Q. Do you recall ever reviewing anything that 
9 was titled causes of action against Epstein? 
10 A. l do not have a specific recollection of 
1 1 that one way or the other. 
12 Q. Do you recall ever reviewing with Mr. Jenne 
13 or any other investigator in your firm any information 
1 4 regarding Mr. Epstein's house staff or airplane staff? 
1 5 A. I do don't recall that one way or the other. 
1 6 I may have, J may not have. 
17 Q. Who is Bill Berger? 
18 A. A former Palm Beach judge that we hired. 
19 Q. Okay. What was his role at your firm? 
20 A. He was a shareholder. 
21 Q. What kind of practice? 
22 A. Litigating cases. 
23 Q. What kind of practice did he litigate? What 
24 kind of cases did he litigate? 
25 A. I don't recall specifically.

Q. When did you hire him? 
A. 2008 or 2009. I don't have a specific 
recollection. 
Q. If you hired lawyers who didn't have a book 
of business, what kind of practice did they do at your 
office? 
A. It depended upon the lawyer. I would have 
tried to get them to work with other lawyers in an 
area that they either were proficient in or wanted to 
become proficient in. 
Q. Okay. You had a meeting at your office 
during which you were asking about information 
regarding referring attorneys, attorneys who had 
referred business to the firm. Do you know what Pm 
talking about? I believe it was back in December of 
'08 or early 2009. 
A. The way you are characterizing that meeting, 
I had a lot of meetings like that. 
Q. What was the purpose of those? 
A. You are going to have to be more specific 
for me, Tonja. 
Q. Let's start generally then. What was -- you 
said you had many meetings like that. Tell me what 
these meetings were for? 
A. Making sure that we were maximizing 
Page 84 
generation of business into the law Ruin. 
Q. What kind of business, legitimate business 
or the other --
A. Legitimate business. 
Q. Sorry, I couldn't hear you. 
A. Legitimate business. The general meetings 
that you are discussing, that was legitimate business. 
Q. So there was a meeting for all attorneys to 
attend regarding generating business, those meetings 
10 were for the legitimate business? 
11 A. If it was addressed to all attorneys, yes. 
12 Q. Okay. And if an e-mail went out to all 
13 attorneys, did paralegals and support staff get it as 
14 well or was it just directed to the attorneys? 
15 A. Certain support staff probably were on that 
1 6 list, like my CFO and COO, and perhaps my IT people, 
1 7 but it was general for the attorneys. 
18 Q. With respect to your IT people, did you have 
19 the capability to review e-mails and interne activity 
20 of all of your employees? 
21 A. I did. 
22 Q. Including attorneys? 
23 A. I did. 
24 Q. Did you ever utilize that tool? 
25 A. Very infrequently. It was a pain because I

1 had to have Curtis Renie or Bill actually come into my 
2 office, set up a special icon to allow me to do that. 
3 It was a real pain. so it was rare. 
4 Q. Who else attended the meetings that you had 
5 with the Clockwork group with respect to the investors 
6 in the Epstein case? 
A. There were multiple meetings with what I'll 
8 call the Clockwork investors at various points in 
9 time. A variety of people came in and out of the 
1 0 meetings. Some of the meetings occurred down in Bova. 
1 1 Other people came up to the meetings. Some of the 
1 2 meetings involved Michael Szafranski, our fake 
1 3 independent verifier. Some of the meetings may have 
1 4 involved bankers and the like. I cannot tell you 
15 specifically who was at those meetings. 
1 6 Q. The specific meetings that we are talking 
1 7 about with -- where you left the boxes at your office, 
1 8 do you recall who else was there with you at that 
1 9 meeting? 
2 0 A. I only remember there being a handful of 
2 1 people from the investment group and myself. I don't 
2 2 recall -- and I remember the guys bringing the boxes 
2 3 the down, but they didn't stay for the meeting. There 
24 may have been other people there, I don't recall one 
25 way or the other who it was. 
Page 86 
1 Q. If the expenditures were being made on a 
2 case that were substantial, did you have to approve 
3 them or did you have a specific practice for them? 
4 A. The head of a practice group could basically 
5 approve them but Irene, our CFO, would generally run 
6 them by me before she actually cut the check. If] 
7 wasn't around she'd run it by Stu. 
8 Q. So as the equity partners you had the 
9 authority to make the determination what funds could 
1 0 and could not be expended? 
1 1 A. As the shareholders, as the two 50 percent 
12 shareholders, we controlled the finances. 
1 3 Q. And if Irene was coming to you to tell you 
14 what the funding was for, to get approval rather, 
1 5 would she tell you specifically what the funding was 
16 for or just tell you we need $100,000? 
17 A. No, if it was a substantial expense --
1 8 Q. Tell me what you deem as substantial. 
1 9 A. That would have been -- substantial to me 
20 would have been based upon how much money we had in 
21 our coffers at the time. So, if it was one of those 
22 periods of time where we had 20 or $30 million 
23 floating around the law firm, Irene probably would 
2 4 have just written a check without even letting me know 
25 we were writing it. If it was one of those times

where we owed 20, $30 million in Ponzi payments out 
and she needed to write a check for even $5,000, she 
probably would have checked with me on that. So 
substantial and whether or not she would have checked 
with me depended upon the circumstance at the time. 
Q. You stated earlier, and I think get 
this quote right, that 2009 was a dismal year; is that 
correct? 
A. For the legitimate law finn business, it was 
a dismal year. 
Q. So in the months immediately preceding the 
dissolution of RRA, July to October of 2009, what 
would you consider a substantial expense that had to 
be approved? 
A. It would vary literally from day-to-day. 
Q. Do you have any independent recollection of 
how you were doing in, say, July 2009? 
A. The legitimate business was always doing 
poorly in 2009, as far as I was concerned. 
Q. So would you have --
A. The Ponzi scheme had its moments of 
significant wealth and significant poverty, so it 
varied from time to time. It was a daily thing. 
Sometimes it was hourly. It just depended upon what 
was coming in and what needed to go out. 
Page 88 
Q. So would you have to utilize the 
illegitimate funds to fund the legitimate cases at 
times? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And that varied daily you said? 
A. Well, all the money was commingled together, 
so we used whatever funds were in there to fund both 
the legitimate and the illegitimate financial 
requirements of the firm, the Ponzi scheme and other 
legitimate and illegitimate things that were going on. 
Q. If an outside agency or investigator was 
being utilized for a case and they needed a signed 
retainer agreement with your firm, would you have to 
approve that? 
A. It would depend upon the significance of the 
expense. I didn't necessarily get involved in every 
retention of every expert in every case. 
Q. Okay. So it would depend on the cost or the 
nature of the case? 
A. Who the lawyer was, their level of 
expertise, all things of that nature. 
Q. If it was this gentleman who you have no 
recollection of meeting, Mr. Black, and the attorney 
was Mr. Edwards, was that something you needed to look 
over?

1 A. Did Wayne Black work for Ron Cacciatore? 
2 Q. Are you asking me --
3 A. I'm asking anyone in the room who wants to 
4 talk to me. 
5 Q. I love to talk to you, but I don't know the 
6 answer to that question. He might have. Brad might 
7 be able to tell you. 
8 MR. EDWARDS: No. 
9 THE WITNESS: When you said Wayne Black's 
10 name again and that I hired him to do something,] 
11 seem to think that he may have been associated in 
12 some way with Mr. Cacciatore, but I'm not sure one 
13 way or the other. I don't remember whether or not] 
14 met Mr. Black, it's possible I did, it's also 
15 possible I did not. And] don't have an independent 
16 recollection of retaining him to do anything or 
17 whether] was part and parcel of the decision if we 
18 did, in fact, retain him, whether] was part and 
19 parcel of the decision to retain him. 
20 BY MS. HADDAD: 
21 Q. Traveling out of state for depositions for 
22 the particular cases, did you have to approve that? 
23 A. It would depend upon who the lawyers were, 
29 tilt significance of the expense. It would have been 
25 case by case. l certainly would not have been 
Page 90 
1 approving or disapproving Mr. Nurik's travel, 
2 Mr. Rosenfeldt's travel, Mr. Boden's travel, 
3 Mr. Lippman's travel. That was their own thing. 
4 If a younger lawyer like a Shawn Birken came 
5 to-me and said he need to travel out of state for 
6 something, if it was just for a deposition, I wouldn't 
7 have gotten involved in that unless he was telling my 
8 CFO, Ms. Stay, that he wanted to fly first class and 
9 stay in the Ritz Carlton, then I would have gotten 
10 involved. But other than that, no. The firm was too 
11 big for me to vet involved on a daily basis with all 
12 that stuff. 
13 Q. If Brad had to go out of state to take a 
14 deposition, you wouldn't be the person to approve or 
15 disapprove that? 
16 A. Russ Adler would have handled that. And if 
17 there was an issue, Russ would have come to me. And 
18 don't know what the relationship was specifically 
19 between Brad and Russ, but its certainly possible 
20 that Brad just was going to go do what he needed to do 
21 to properly handle the case and I would have trusted 
22 him to do that. 
23 MS. HADDAD: Can we just take a second. We 
24 are going to take a minute, okay? 
25 THE WITNESS: Sure.

2 FURTHER DIRECT EXAMINATION 
BY MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Q. All right. Mr. Rothstein, Jack Goldberger, 
I'm going to ask you some questions now. You 
testified that you knew Jeffrey Epstein was a 
7 billionaire. You did testify to that today, correct? 
8 A. Yes. 
9 Q. Okay. Tell me how you knew that. How did 
10 you know that Mr. Epstein was a billionaire? 
11 A. Russ Adler told me. I looked him up on the 
12 internet. 
13 Q. What did you look on the internet about 
14 Mr. Epstein? 
15 A. I don't recall, but I remember looking up an 
16 seeing that he was very wealthy, that he was a 
17 billionaire. 
18 Q. Okay. So as far as learning that 
19 Mr. Epstein was a billionaire, you learned via two 
2 0 ways, one was from Russ Adler, correct? Is that 
21 correct? 
22 A. Yes, sir. 
2 3 Q. And the other was through looking up 
2 4 Mr. Epstein on the internet, correct? 
25 A. Yes.

Page 92 
Q. Okay. And you don't know what you reviewed 
on the internet in an effort to determine that 
Mr. Epstein was a billionaire; is that correct? 
A. I do not recall. 
Q. Do you know when you did that? 
A. I do not. 
Q. Was it prior to your needing to use the 
Epstein case to further your Ponzi scheme? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Okay. So prior to -- I think you indicated 
that you needed an influx of money at some point and 
that's when you decided to use the Epstein case in 
furtherance of the Ponzi scheme; is that correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. So prior to that time though, prior to 
determining that you needed to use the Epstein case 
for the Ponzi scheme, you looked up Mr. Epstein and 
you spoke to Mr. Adler about his work; is that 
correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Why did you do that, Mr. Rothstein, if you 
weren't using the Epstein case at that point in your 
Ponzi scheme? 
A. Because it was a legitimate case in the 
legitimate portion of RRA that] had reason to believe 
Page 93 
24 (Pages 90 to 93) 
FRIEDMAN, LOMBARDI & OLSON 
305-371-6677 
5ed93085-0554-447f-bcdd-ca2d8fe941df 
1 from speaking to Mr. Adler could bring in a 
2 significant amount of money to the firm. 
3 Q. At that time Mr. Adler was one of your 
4 co-conspirators in the Ponzi scheme; is that con-ect? 
5 A. By this time, yes, sir. 
6 Q. Okay. When did Mr. Adler become a 
7 co-conspirator in your Ponzi scheme? 
8 A. I don't recall the specific date. 
9 Q. Was it before or after Mr. Adler recommended 
1 0 that Brad Edwards be hired at your firm? 
1 1 A. Before. 
1 2 Q. So before Brad Edwards was hired at RRA, 
1 3 Russell Adler was a co-conspirator of yours in the 
1 4 illegal part of the RRA firm; is that correct? 
15 A. Yes. 
1 6 Q. Then after that time you hired --
1 7 Mr. Edwards was hired after Adler was your 
1 8 co-conspirator? You are laughing, you are smiling, 
1 9 why is that, sir? 
2 0 A. Because when you say RRA that way, the 
2 1 speaker sounds, it sounds like you are roaring. 
2 2 Q. Okay. I'll just say Rothstein, how about 
2 3 that? You know what I'm talking about if I just say 
24 Rtthstein. 
25 A. RBA is fine. 
Page 
• 1 Q. What did Adler tell you about the Epstein 
2 case that Edwards had at the time you were 
3 contemplating hiring him to become a member of the 
4 Rothstein firm? 
A. He told me that it was a huge case involving 
7 6 a billionaire pedophile and that it was a winner. 
i 7 Q. Did you, when you heard that, did you think 
8 that that was a case that could become part of your 
9 Ponzi scheme? 
P 10 
1 A. No, I actually thought of it as a way to 
11 earn legitimate money to help me out of the Ponzi 
12 scheme. 
1 3 Q. So at the time you hired Mr. Edwards and you 
1 4 were talking to Adler about Edwards, you were trying 
15 to get out from under the Ponzi scheme? 
1 6 A. In the bulk of 2009 I was praying for some 
17 sort of legitimate influx of money to get out of the 
1 8 Ponzi scheme. 
1 9 Q. Okay. So now Adler tells you about this 
20 Brad Edwards guy, did you know Brad Edwards before 
2 1 Adler talked to you about him? Had you run into him? 
B 22 A. I may have. I don't have a specific 
23 recollection one way or the other. 
2 4 Q. Okay. So now he-tells you that you should 
25 consider hiring Brad Edwards, this is your 
1 Q. Okay. So Adler is your co-conspirator in 
2 the Ponzi scheme at the time that Brad Edwards is 
3 hired, correct? 
4 A. Yes. 
5 - Q. Okay. Was it Adler who recommended to you 5 
6 that Brad Edwards be hired? 
A. Yes. He was one of the people. 
8 Q. Who else recommended that Edwards be hired? 
9 A. I don't have a specific recollection of who 
10 it was, but others did. 1C 
1 1 Q. All right. But you have a recollection of 1 1 
12 Adler being one of the people, so let's talk about 1 2 
13 that, all right? 13 
1 4 What did Adler tell you about Brad Edwards 1 4 
15 when you hired him? Did he tell you that he had these 15 
16 Epstein cases or an Epstein case in the fold? 1 6 
17 A. Among other things, yes. 17 
18 Q. What else did he tell you? 18 
19 A. Told me he was a great lawyer and a great 19 
20 guy. 20 
21 Q. Did he tell you what his history was, what 2 1 
22 Edwards' history was prior to coming to the Rothstein 22 
23 firm? 23 
24 A. I'm certain that I asked him, but I don't 24 
25 have a specific recollection of that conversation. 25

Page 96 
co-conspirator talking to you, right? Is that 
correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And he says, by the way, he's got this great 
Epstein case involving this billionaire, correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Presumably then-you had a meeting with Brad 
Edwards when you met him; is that correct? 
MR. SCAROLA: Presumably he had a meeting 
when he met him? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: I'm sorry, Mr. Scarola was 
cutting you off when you answered, so go ahead, answer 
again. 
MR. SCAROLA: I didn't understand the 
question. 
BY MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Q. Do you understand the question, 
Mr. Rothstein? 
A. I'm not sure I do because you asked me if] 
had a meeting when I met him and] think that meeting 
him is a meeting. 
Q. Well, there was a meeting, correct? 
A. I most likely met him before I hired him. I 
most likely talked to him before I hired him because 
that was my general way of doing business. It's all

1 together possible that I gave Russ the okay to hire 
2 him before, I just don't have a specific recollection 
3 one way or the other. 
4 Q. At some point,Itake it, you learned, 
5 whether you sat in on a meeting when Mr. Edwards was 
6 hired or whether your co-conspirator hired him, at 
7 some point you learned that Mr. Edwards, in fact, had 
8 been hired by the firm; is that correct? 
9 A. I'm certain that I gave the final okay to 
10 hire him. 
11 Q. Okay. When you were giving the final okay 
12 to hire him, I assume there had to be discussion of 
13 the money that he was going to be paid, correct? 
14 A. With somebody, yes. 
15 Q. Certainly with Mr. Edwards, right? I assume 
16 he wanted to know how much he was getting paid. 
A. Yes, but don't have a specific 
18 recollection of whether l discussed that with him or 
19 whetherl authorized Adler or maybe even Rosenfeldt to 
20 discuss it with him. 1 don't recall. 
21 Q. Do you have the slightest idea how much 
22 money Mr. Edwards was paid when he first joined the 
23 firm, what his salary was? 
24 A. 1 don't have an independent recollection. 
25 -- Q. Generally someone like Mr. Edwards at his

level of accomplishment and his age, you know what the 
general salary would have been at your firm? 
A. It didn't work that way. 
Q. I see. Tell me how it worked. 
A. It's a case-by-case basis. 
Q. Tell me how it worked. 
A. Case-by-case basis. 
Q. And how did you make that determination on a 
case-by-case basis? 
A. Actual book of business, potential book of 
business, potentiality for growth, character, what he 
brought to the table, and obviously a function of how 
much money we had available at the time. 
Q. Okay. And you don't have any recollection 
of the machinations that occurred in determining what 
Mr. Edwards salary would be, correct? 
A. I do not. 
Q. But certainly one of the things you would 
consider would be the book of business, i.e. the 
Epstein case, right? 
A. I'm certain thatl did consider the Epstein 
case. 
Q. Do you know whether he brought any other 
book of business --
A. But I'm also certain it wasn't the only 
Page 99 
1 factorl considered. 
Q. All right. Do you know whether he brought, 
in his book of business, do you know whether be 
brought any other cases to the firm other than the 
Epstein case? 
A. 1 don't recall one way or the other. 
Q. Okay. Do you know whether your -- well, bad 
question, I won't ask that. 
Now, you've talked a lot about Ken Jenne 
110 here this morning. Was Ken Jenne part of your Ponzi 
11 scheme? 
12 A. No. sir. 
13 Q. Had nothing to do with it, right? 
14 A. That's correct. 
15 Q. Other than his having -- working for you as 
16 an investigator, he was not one of your 
17 co-conspirators, right? 
18 A. He didn't work for me as an investigator, he 
19 worked for me heading up our investigative division, 
20 heading up our internal security, heading up my 
21 personal security, and acting as a political advisor 
22 tome. 
23 Q. Okay. Did he serve any kind of 
24 investigative function at all, after all, he was a law 
25 enforcement officer at one point in his career?

A. I note that he assisted the other people at 
the firm that were doing the investigative work. 1 
don't know if he personally did investigative work. 
He may have. 
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Jenne, in his role 
as your advisor or your political consultant, do you 
know if he was involved in any kind of illegality, 
illegal wire tapping or anything like that while he 
was at Rothstein? 
MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, I'm going to 
object to the form of the question, vague and 
ambiguous. 
THE WITNESS: To my knowledge he was not. 
BY MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Q. To your knowledge, no? 
A. Correct. 
Q. Okay. You talked about having a bunch of 
fundraisers, I know you had a bunch of fundraisers 
that was kind of a deal at Rothstein. This was kind 
of a rock star law firm, right? I mean, you had lots 
of fundraisers, lots of parties, right? Was that the 
image you were trying to present? 
A. In reality that's the way we were. 
Q. Okay. 
A. A lot of young lawyers having a good time, 
Page 101

FRIEDMAN, LOMBARDI & OLSON

5ed93085-0554-447f-bcdd-ca2d8fe941df 
1 trying to make money. 
2 Q. And these young lawyers. would you consider 
3 Mr. Edwards to be a young lawyer or a middle-aged 
9 lawyer? 
5 A. Young lawyer. 
6 Q. Okay. Was he one of young lawyers that came 
7 to these fundraisers at your home? 
8 A. I don't recall whether he was there or not. 
9 I recall him being at some, but I didn't know if he 
1 0 was at all of them. 
1 1 Q. Okay. You do recall him coming to some of 
1 2 the fundraisers, though, correct? 
1 3 A. I recall him being at my home. It may have 
14 been for firm parties or other parties, it may have 
1 5 been for fundraisers there. 
1 6 Q. And that was during the time period that the 
17 Ponzi scheme was still going on. correct? 
18 A. Yes. 
1 9 Q. Did Adler ever the tell you about any 
2 0 discussions he had with Brad Edwards about the illegal 
2 1 part of the operations at Rothstein? 
22 A. Can you reask the question, please? 
23 Q. Sure. Sure. 
24 Did Russell Adler ever tell you -- Russell 
25 Adler is your co-conspirator, we've established that. 
Page 102 
1 Did Russell Adler in the furtherance of your 
2 conspiracy ever tell you he had discussed with Brad 
3 Edwards about the illegal activities at RRA? 
4 A. No. 
5 Q. Now,..you testified when asked about whether 
6 the press -- if.you were involved in asking the press 
7 to run with the E stein sto ou said something to 
8 the effect, the wa I was selling the Ponzi scheme it 
9 would be overkill. 
10 I didn't understand your answer like you 
11 didn't understand some of my questions, so I'd like 
12 you to kind of tell me what you  meant by that. 
13 A. I was selling purportedly confidential 
14 settlements. Confidentiality was the hallmark of the 
15 Ponzi scheme, so too much publicity would have created 
1 6 a roblem for me in the sale of what was supposed to 
17 las smIeteIconfidentialseft1ement. 
18 Q. I think what you are telling me, and I don't 
19 want to misstate what I think you are telling me, but 
20 is it true that you felt some publicity would be okay 
21 but too much would be counter to the purposes of the 
22 conspiracy. Is that a fair statement? 
23 A. The way I was thinking about it at the time 
24 this was going on was that some_publicity would assist

was a real case goirjg on, but that within that 1 woad 
have to create some sort of fictions in ordeno_aelL 
the fakeyroduct.  
Q. Okay. At the time that you decided to use 
the Epstein case as part of your illicit Ponzi scheme 
theme,Ithink you testified earlier today, when you 
were in some dire straights, you needed an influx of 
money, right? 
A. Yes. 
Q. That's when you decided to use the Epstein 
matters, correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Okay. And you knew, I assume, being the 
Ponzi scheme mastermind here, that you needed to make 
sure that you had at least a working knowledge of the 
Epstein case so that you could answer questions to the 
investors. I recognize that you left the room and 
told them to look at it, but you had to some knowledge 
of the case, right? 
MR. SCAROLA: Counsel, that's a 
misrepresentation of what the earlier testimony was. 
object, no proper predicate. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay, let's go through the 
whole thing again. 
MR. SCAROLA: No, you are not going to go 
Page 109 
through the whole thing again. Just because we have 
tolerated two lawyers asking questions, does not mean 
3 we are going to tolerate two lawyers asking the same 
questions. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Your objection is noted. 
BY MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Q. Okay. So let's talk about your need to use 
the Epstein case to further your conspiracy. You 
needed an influx of money, did you not? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Okay. You decided to use the Epstein case 
for that purpose, right? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And in order to use the Epstein case, you 
were going to meet with the investors and pitch the 
Epstein case with the investors, correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And in an effort to pitch the case to the 
investors, you had to have some knowledge of the case, 
did you not? 
A. Some level of knowledge, yes, sir. 
Q. Okay. And in order to gain that knowledge, 
you spoke to your co-conspirator, Russell Adler; is 
that correct? 
A. That's one of the things I did.

Q. Okay. And do you remember what Adler told 
2 you specifically about the Epstein case that helped 
3 you have a basis of information to sell it to the 
4 investors? 
5 A. Other than him telling me that it was a 
6 billionaire pedophile, other than him telling me about 
7 the flight manifest, don't have a specific 
8 recollection of what else he told me. 
9 Q. Did you actually look at the flight manifest 
1 0 at sometime, Mr. Rothstein? 
1 1 A. Yes, sir. 
12 Q. And what was it about those flight manifests 
1 3 that you felt would help you pitch the Epstein case to 
1 4 the investor? 
1 5 A. I don't remember who specifically was on it, 
16 but Iremember it looking juicy. 
17 Q. You don't know who was on it? 
1 8 A. 1 don't recall. 
1 9 Q. Did you add any names to that manifest at 
2 0 any time? 
2 1 A. I had -- you mean physically write names on 
22 there? 
23 Q. Any way you want to interpret -- did you --
29 not physically write any names on the manifest, but 
25 did you tell the investors that there were names on 
Page 106 
the manifest that were actually not on the manifest? 
2 A. I told the investors that there were other 
3 people that appeared on manifests,] don't recall 
4 whether it was that manifest or other manifests, and 1 
5 got the names of those people from Russ Adler. 
6 Whether or not they actually appeared on the manifest 
7 or another manifest, 1 do not know.

12 Q. And is it your testimony today that you 12 
13 never looked at the manifest to see whether Bill 13 
14 Clinton or Prince Andrew's name were really on the 14 
15 manifest that you were going to use to pitch the 15 
16 investors? 16 
17 A. It was my understanding they didn't have all 17 
18 the manifests. 18 
19 Q. Okay. Did you ever ask for the manifests 19 
20 that purportedly had the name of Bill Clinton or 20 
21 Prince Andrew on it? 21 
22 A. 1 probably did, but I don't have a specific 22 
23 recollection one way or the other. 1 23 
24 Q. When you say you didn't have all the 24 
25 manifests, were all the manifests in your office -- 25

were all the manifests within the law firm of RRA and 
you simply didn't have them in your office? 
A. I have no idea one way or the other. 
Q. Okay. 
A. I did not have them. 
Q. You were told by Russell Adler that you 
didn't have -- that you physically didn't have all the 
manifests, correct? 
A. That's correct. 
Q. But you don't know whether they were in the 
building somewhere, these other supposed manifests? 
A. I have no idea one way or the other. 
Q. You never asked for proof that Bill Clinton 
or Prince Andrew's name were on a manifest somewhere? 
A. I didn't say that. I may very well have 
asked Adler or Ken Jenne to find the other manifests. 
Q. Were you ever shown a manifest with the name 
Bill Clinton or the name Prince Andrew on them? 
A. I do not recall one way or the other whether 
I saw that or not. I remember Adler telling me about 
it and then me repeating that information to the 
investors based upon Mr. Adler's representations to 
me. 
Q. Now, you testified that you were told that 
the Epstein cases were legitimate cases. Do you 
Page 108 
remember that testimony you gave this morning? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And you remember your testimony that you 
were told they were legitimate cases by both Russ 
Adler and Brad Edwards, do you remember that? 
A. I never said that Mr. Edwards or Mr. Adler 
said, Scott, these are legitimate cases. I didn't 
question them as to their legitimacy. 
Q. You did testify that you talked to Brad 
Edwards about the Epstein cases; is that correct? 
MR. SCAROLA: No, counsel, that is a 
misrepresentation of the earlier testimony. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: No, it's not. 
BY MR. GOLDBERGER: 
Q.  Did you talk to Brad Edwards about the 
Epstein cases? 
A. I do not recall one way or the other.  That  
- 
was my prior testimony, that's still in testimon 
-don't -- I do not recall. 
Q. We'll let the record speak --
A. l know I spoke to Adler about it. 
Q. We'll let the record speak for itself. Your 
testimony, as I am questioning you now, is that you do 
not recall whether you spoke to Brad Edwards about the 
Epstein cases; is that correct?

5ed93085-0554-447f-bcdd-ca2d8fe941df 
1 A. If you are including within that me walking 
2 past Brad in the hall and saying, Hey. Brad how are 
3 you? How is the Epstein stuff going? Then its very 
4 likely that I talked to him about it in that manner. 
5 But lhave no specific recollection one way or the 
6 other as to having any lengthy conversations with 
Mr. Edwards about the case. 
8 I had a co-conspirator who was deeply 
9 involved in the Ponzi scheme that I could go to to get 
10 any information I wanted, NIL Adler. I didn't need to 
11 go to Mr. Edwards. 
12 Q. So if you had a question of your 
13 co-conspirator, Russell Adler, about the Epstein case, 
14 you would go ask Adler and would Adler always have the 
15 answer for you or would he say he would get you the 
16 answer? 
17 A. Both. 
18 Q. When he didn't have the answer, do you know 
19 who he was getting the answer from? 
20 MR. SCAROLA: Objection, predicate. 
21 THE WITNESS: I don't know who he was 
22 getting it from and I may have contacted other people 
23 in the office who were working on the file to ask. I 
24 may have asked Mr. Jenne,Imay have asked Ms. 
25 Holmes, I many have asked a whole myriad of people.

1 BY MR. GOLDBERGER: 
2 Q. So Ms. Holmes was working on the Epstein 
3 cases? 
4 A. It's my refreshed recollection from seeing 4 
5 one of those e-mails that she must have been. 5 
6 Q. Okay. And Ms. Holmes you said was a former 
7 federal law enforcement officer, was that your 
8 testimony? 
9 A. Yes. 
10 Q. You don't know whether she was FBI or IRS, 10 
11 correct? 11 
12 A. I don't remember. 12 
13 Q. Okay. And upon reflection, do you know 13 
14 whether she was hired without your say-so based on 14 
15 what Mr. Jenne told you or did you meet with her? 15 
16 A. No, I actually -- I remember meeting with 16 
17 Ms. Holmes. 17 
18 Q. Okay. What do you remember about that 18 
19 meeting? 19 
20 A. I remember talking about her relative who 20 
21 was a judge. I remember her telling me about her time 21 
22 in law enforcement. I just don't remember which 22 
23 agency. 23 
24 Q. Did she tell you why she left law 24 
25 enforcement? 25 
Page 111 
A. She may have, I don't recall one way or the 
other. 
Q. Did you ever ask Ms. Holmes to use any of 
her prior contacts in law enforcement to assist you in 
the Ponzi scheme to get information for you? 
A. The question is kind of convoluted because 
the way you are asking it, it seems like you are 
intimating that Ms. Holmes knew. I may have asked 
Ms. Holmes to get me information that I was going to 
utilize with my co-conspirators in the Ponzi scheme, 
but Ms. Holmes did not know that there was a Ponzi 
scheme going on. 
Q. All right. So you may have asked Ms. Holmes 
to try and get some information for you from her 
contacts in law enforcement, but it's your testimony, 
and I don't dispute it, it's your testimony that she 
knew nothing about the Ponzi scheme, correct? 
A. I may have, I may not have. I do not 
remember and she absolutely knew nothing about the 
Ponzi scheme. 
Q. Okay. Now, we talked about Brad Edwards 
getting paid and the multilevel ways in which you 
determined what a person's salary was. Do you know 
whether Brad Edwards got any bonuses along the way 
once the Epstein case was used as part of the Ponzi 
Page 112 
scheme? 
A. He did not. 
Q. So he was --
A. If he got a bonus, it was something he 
earned. 
Q. Did you make a determination as to what that 
bonus would be? 
A. If he got a bonus, I would have been 
instrumental in determining it. You can determine if 
he got a bonus by looking at our financial records,1 
don't have an independent recollection one way or the 
other. 
Q. So you don't know whether he got a bonus at 
all, correct? 
A. That's correct. 
Q. So1 assume that if he got a bonus you 
wouldn't know whether it occurred before or after the 
Epstein case was used as part of the Ponzi scheme? 
A. I don't know if he got a bonus, which means 
I wouldn't know the time frame. 
Q. But we would learn -- you are instructing 
us, we would learn that by looking at when the Epstein 
case was brought into the Ponzi scheme and we learn 
that by looking at these -- what was the group that it 
was used to pitch to?

5ed93085-0554-447f-bcdd-ca2d8fe941 df 
1 A. Clockwork. 1. 
2 Q. So we would look at when the Clockwork group 2 
3 was brought into this and the Epstein case was used 3 
then and then we would look at the payroll records to 
5 see whether Mr. Edwards got a bonus after the 5 
6 Clockwork group was brought into the Ponzi scheme. 6 
correct? 7 
8 A. From a timing perspective, yes. But 
9 Mr. Edwards had nothing to do with the Ponzi scheme, 
10 nor was he rewlr_d_e_daltinik_without his 10 
11 _knowledge for helnip me with the Ponzi scheme. If he 11 
12 .1yas rewarded it was because he deserved,] felt he 12 
1 3 deserved a reward, havin nothing to do with the Ponzi 13 
19 scheme. The bulk of this law firm had nothing to do 14 
15 with the Ponzi scheme. 15 
16 Q. I think you testified already, though, that 16 
17 money was fundable in the firm, right? I mean, you 17 
18 know, illegal money was used for legitimate purposes, 18 
19 correct? r19 
20 A. Yes. 20 
21 Q. Okay. So, for example, investigations that 21 
22 were done with the Epstein case, it's very possible 22 
23 that legitimate Ponzi money was used to finance those 23 
24 investigations? 24 
25 A. I'd be guessing. It's certainly possible 25 
Page 114 
1 because all the money went into a whole series of 
2 pots, and if you look at, most of the pots were trust 
3 accounts. If you look back, you look to see what my 
4 CFO, who was also a co-conspirator was doing, she was 
5 pulling the money from wherever she needed to to fund 
6 whatever she needed to fund.

10 Q. Let me circle back to what you needed to 
11 learn about the Epstein cases to help make your pitch 
12 to the investors. 
13 You talked about the manifest already, 
1 4 correct, the flight manifest? 
15 A. Yes. 
16 Q. Okay. What else did you want to learn about 
17 the case or what else did you learn about the case so 
18 that you were conversant when you spoke to the 
19 investors about the Epstein case? 
20 A. 1 recall asking someone what the causes of 
21 action were. 
22 Q. Okay. Did you understand what they were? 
23 A. I likely did at the time, I don't remember 
24 what they were now. 
25 Q. Okay. Do you know which case we are talking

about? By the way, you had a number of Epstein cases 
in-house, do you know which case you were talking 
about? 
A. As I sit here today, no, sir, I don't 
remember. 
Q. Was it a state case or a federal case? 
A. I don't remember one way or the other. 
Q. All right. 
A. I utilized all those boxes all together. 1 
don't remember which  one I sold them. 
Q. And the exhibits --
A. It's something completely fictitious that  
Q. The exhibit that you were shown earlier, 
Exhibit Number 1, that's the long multi-page federal 
lawsuit. Do you know whether that was part of the 
information that you reviewed or shown to the 
investors when you were pitching to them? 
A. I do not remember one way or the other. 
Q. Okay. Now, did you make any effort to learn 
from your co-conspirator who the plaintiffs were in 
this case, what kind of women they were? 
A. Only that they were underage. 
Q. Did an one tell you that these women had --
some of these women had a history of prostitution? 
Page 116 
A. They may have told me that, I wouldn't have 
cared one way or the other, 
Q. Why would you not have cared about that, 
Mr. Rothstein? 
A. It had nothin to do with the sale of the 
Ponzi scheme settlements,. 
Q. Okay. Were you told by anyone whether any 
of the women involved as plaintiffs in the case may 
have worked at adult clubs in the past? I mean strip 
clubs, let's call it what it is. 
A. I may have been told that one way or the 
other. But againziLhadpothing to do with the Ponzi 
scheme sale of fake settlements. 
_ 
Q. As part of the information that you were 
told by you co-conspirator, Russell Adler, were you 
told that some of the plaintiffs that you had in-house 
had travelled on Mr. Epstein's airplane? 
A. I believe Russ did tell me that. 
Q. You know, in fact, that that was not true, 
correct? 
A. lhave no idea one way or the other, nor did 
I care. 
Q. But your co-conspirator told you that, 
right? 
A. Mr. Adler did, in fact, tell me that certain_

3 Q. Did you ever meet any of the plaintiffs? 
4 MR. SCAROLA: That's question that's been 
5 asked and answered. 
6 THE WITNESS: I do not have a specific 
7 recollection of ever meeting them. 
8 MR. SCAROLA: You are exhausting my 
9 indulgence. 
10 MR. GOLDBERGER: Fair enough. 
1 1 MR. SCAROLA: You've exhausted my 
12 indulgence. 
13 BY MR. GOLDBERGER: 
19 Q. Do you know whether any of your 
15 investigators at the firm had any kind of high tech 
16 surveillance equipment or, you know, wire tapping 
17 equipment? 
18 A. I believe they did. 
19 Q. Do you know whether this was legal stuff or 
20 illegal staff? 
2 1 A. I did not know, nor did I care. 
22 Q. Do you know if any of that stuff was used to 
23 either wire tap or surveil Mr. Epstein? 
24 A. I do not know one way or the other. 
25 Q. What sort of equipment did you know that 
Page 118 
they had, meaning your investigators? 
2 A. I had told Mr. Jenne and others involved in 
3 the investigation arm of RRA to get whatever equipment 
4 they thought they needed and to get the best stuff 
5 that they could get. What they actually did, I can't 
6 tell you. 
7 Q. You know as part of the Epstein litigation, 
8 and I'm talking about now after your using it in the 
9 Ponzi scheme, do you know whether anyone at your firm 
10 attempted to depose ex-President Bill Clinton? 
11 A. I don't recall that, sir. 
12 Q. Okay. How about Donald Trump, same 
13 question? 
14 A. I don't recall that. As a matter of fact, 
15 we had represented Trump in some things, we had some 
16 pretty close ties with him, so I can't imagine that 
17 they would have done that with my authority. 
18 Q. Okay. 
19 A. I don't recall that. 
20 Q. Do you know whether Adler would have --
21 would Adler have the authorize to do that without 
22 getting your permission? 
23 A. The authority, no. Might he have tried, 
24 yes.

A. Yes. 
Q. Who do you know him to be? 
A. Former U.S. attorney, current criminal 
defense lawyer. 
Q. Was he a friendship of the firm's? 
A. Represented RRA when I fled the country.

of yours at least, right? 
A. He wasn't a friend of mine. 
Q. A friend of the firm? 
A. No idea. 
Q. He represented them when I fled the country.

11 MR. NURIK: Mark, I don't know what your 
12 time frame is on your litigation, but the ability to 
13 receive the transcript, review it and prepare an 
14 errata sheet within what is normally the time 
15 allotted under the court rules cannot be accomplished 
16 in this case. 
17 MR. GOLDBERGER: How much time are you 
18 generally-.-
19 MR. NURIK: I don't know. 
20 Actually, the first set of errata sheets 
21 have just been prepared and finalized for the first 
22 deposition in December. I'm not suggesting it will 
23 take that long this time, but if you can give me an 
24 idea of what your time responsibilities are with the 
25 court, what the time limits are --
Page 124 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Do you think it will be 
less than a month, two months? 
MR. NURIK: i don't think it will be less 
than a month. First of all, a lot depends on the 
ability to get the transcript to him to review. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Right. 
MR. NURIK: And that's a whole procedure, 
it's not normal circumstances that we are dealing 
with. 
10 MR. GOLDBERGER: If time becomes an issue, 
11 we'll approach you and ask you to expedite. 
12 MR. SCAROLA: Mark, will tell that from 
13 our perspective time is an issue. 
14 MR. NUM: Have at it then, Jack. Do what 
15 you need to do to get it done. 
16 MR. SCAROLA: There is a long pending 
17 motion for summary judgment on Brad's behalf that has 
18 been delayed for purposes of taking this deposition. 
19 We are very anxious to be able to call that motion 
20 for summary judgment up for hearing, so whatever can 
21 be done reasonably to expedite the preparation of 
22 this portion of this transcript would be appreciated. 
23 We understand there are limitations beyond your 
24 control, but to the extent you can do it, that would 
25 be helpful. Thank you.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010968.txt,"at the end. Risk theory reinforces that impression by adding that the contribution of
productivity in the form of realized work/human capital actually declines. One
cannot pound too many stakes through the heart of the doctrine that pay

compensates realized work alone.

Next Generation Theory

I also treat rate of return. This combined free growth theory with insights of Petty
in 1662 and William Stanley Jevons in 1871. Petty’s idea was that each generation
passes the baton to the next. Our investment horizon is the generation length. Its
reciprocal, or one over that period, gives our time preference rate. Jevons also saw
time preference as the reciprocal of the period of production, but did not connect
that to the generation length. I adjust Petty’s estimate of the length from his 21
years to 28.5 by allowing for later births as well as firstborns. The reciprocal is 3.5%

per year. I add free growth as an exogenous and unspecified variable.

As with Mill and free growth theory, | have to walk a fine line between crediting
Petty and putting my ideas in his mouth. Petty dictated his books and pamphlets,
and is not always clear. My idea, probably but not certainly the same as his, is that
each generation invests everything in the next in trust that it will do the same. All
our capital of both factors, although Petty spoke only of a cornfield, is exhausted in
putting the next generation in place. The time horizon to get this done is the

generation length.

This 28.5 years, as I model it, becomes Jevons’ “period of production”. Its reciprocal,
meaning one over it, gives rate of return. The idea of a period of production whose
reciprocal gave rate of return had begun with Rae in 1934, if you don’t count Petty,
and passed through Nassau Senior to Jevons and Boehm Bawerk. All assumed
growthlessness for simplicity. Return is growth rate plus cash flow rate. It simplifies
to the pure consumption rate at the collective scale. All these men, even Petty, were
really modeling the pure consumption rate. 28.5 years gives the period of

replication, in my view, or period of production if there were no growth.

I'm going upstairs to hunt for my copy of Lolita, or will get on my kindle and reread on our way to 
Australia. I may have lent it to one of my kids. I would recommend reading My Antonia by Cather next 
time you're on a long plane trip. The prose is gorgeous, and the book has-- come to think of it-- similar 
themes to Lolita in that it's about a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a young 
girl. 
Thank you for this help with Serena. I'm so sorry about what happened with WA. I will keep the bootleg

After the US imposed sanctions on the Syrian leadership earlier in May, the EU foreign ministers agreed to impose travel bans and to freeze the assets of President Assad and nine other Syrian senior officials. Within days of the EU announcement, Canada invoked similar travel and economic sanctions.

 

While Russia blocked any reference in the G8 communiqué to the possibility of deferring the issue of Syria to the UN Security Council, the communiqué’s compromise language illustrates the international community’s increased pressure on the regime. The G8 leaders stated that they were “appalled” by the death of peaceful protesters and called on the Syrian leadership to immediately stop using force against its people or the G-8 countries would “consider taking further measures”. 

 

At the same time, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah—the leader of the Lebanese party Hizbullah—called on the Syrian people to give the government time to effectuate reforms, arguing that President Assad believes in reforming the system and is determined to implement change. The Hizbullah leader denied that his party has dispatched fighters to assist the Syrian regime in quelling the protest movement. Anti-Iran and -Hizbullah slogans were chanted in a number of Syrian cities in response to Nasrallah’s defense of the regime and his pictures were burned in Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria.

 

Syrian protesters declared Friday “the day of the Guardians of the Homeland”—a reference to the Syrian armed forces—in an effort to encourage the army to join the uprising. Security and military forces appear, however, to be stepping up their campaign in an attempt to end the protests. Tens of people were killed or wounded over the weekend and tanks have entered two suburbs of the city of Homs, Rastan, and Talbiseh. The heavy-handed repression by police and military officials may lead demonstrators to consider a recourse to arms.

 

The government is cracking down on protesters’ use of social media, but, in contrast to what occurred in Egypt, it has refrained from a general shut down of the internet. Security officials are forcing dissidents to turn over their Facebook passwords and have switched off 3G mobile networks in order to prevent the uploading of protestor videos to YouTube. The electricity and phone service has been cut off in neighborhoods where discontent is mounting. 

 

Facebook and, in particular, its “Syrian Revolution 2011” page, has been a vital platform for activists to mobilize protests and to disseminate information. Syria has over 580,000 Facebook users. In response to government measures, protesters have created multiple Facebook pages under different names and have given their Facebook passwords to friends in case they are arrested or disappear and their comments opposing the Assad regime  need to be quickly removed from personal webpages.

 

Syrian activists acknowledge their debt to the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, further improvising and improving on their tactics on a daily basis in an effort to avoid retribution by the regime and to sustain the protest movement. Daytime demonstrations have moved to the evening in order to make it more difficult for security forces to identify individual protesters and to single them out for arrest. After dark, protesters can disperse to unlit alleyways to escape arrest—a tactic Syrian activists call “tayyara” or flying.

 

Yemen

The authority of President Saleh’s government continues to erode rapidly and Yemen appears to be edging closer towards a civil war. Tribal fighters in the capital of Sanaa, have gained control of key ministries, including the Interior Ministry. Brigades from the Republican Guard—the President’s main forces—have surrendered to tribal fighters east and west of the capital who have succeeded in blocking their deployment to Sanaa.

 

According to well-informed sources, the Vice President, the Prime Minister, and the Speaker of the Yemeni Consultative Council have tried to convince President Saleh to sign the agreement mediated by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in an effort to avoid civil conflict. Disregarding their advice, President Saleh remains convinced that he will be able to stem the uprising and maintain his control of the government.

 

On Sunday night, President Saleh ordered units of the Republican Guard and Central Security—commanded by his son and a nephew, respectively—to clear the protestors from Liberty Square in the city of Taizs, where they have been camping for more than four months. Dozens of civilians were killed and approximately 1000 were wounded. Reports indicate that President Saleh is preparing to attack protesters in other cities and towns.

 

The absence of a political solution to the Yemeni uprising has led to an escalation of violence in Sanaa. Fighting between President Saleh’s forces and those of the leader of the powerful Hashid tribe, Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar—a supporter of the Youth revolution—broke out on Monday. The Republican Guards fired missiles at Ahmar’s residence, killing approximately fifty people, including prominent personalities who were trying to mediate an end to the fighting. This attack has further alienated other tribes from President Saleh’s regime.

 

Friday’s G8 declaration expressed growing concern regarding the situation in Yemen and urged President Saleh to immediately “ensure that the legitimate aspirations of the Yemeni people are addressed.” Reports indicate that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has also called on President Saleh to immediately leave office. Having turned his army against the Ahmar family, which has close ties to Saudi leaders, President Saleh has no doubt done some damage to Saudi-Yemeni relations.

 

US officials are continuing to consult with Arab and European allies in an effort to bring the deteriorating situation to the attention of the UN Security Council. A UNSC Presidential Statement asking Saleh to accept the GCC-mediated agreement is being considered. In the absence of compliance, and in the event of an escalation of fighting, sanctions could be imposed on the President and his family. Last Sunday, John Brennan, Assistant to President Obama, called President Saleh to brief him on Washington’s plans and to urge him to sign the Gulf agreement.

 

The sudden withdrawal of government forces from the city of Zinjibar, in the Abyan province, made it possible for al-Qaida fighters to occupy the city and to take over government offices. Military commanders who defected from the regime have issued a communiqué accusing the President of facilitating al-Qaida’s takeover of Zinjibar. They see this as an attempt to scare the West into supporting President Saleh by convincing them that al-Qaida will take over if Saleh leaves. The split within the military is wide and deep.

 

The Republican Guard and the Special Forces, the elite forces that are in charge of the President’s protection, are not necessarily immune from division. Each side, however, calculates that its opponents are weak and, therefore, the temptation to resort to military means to resolve the impasse is very high. 

 

Jordan

Demonstrations took place after Friday prayers in the cities of Amman and Maan—where railroad workers went on strike, paralyzing rail services. Protesters called for political reforms and increased efforts to combat corruption. A silent protest was also convened in front of the Jordanian Parliament, calling for constitutional democracy, not just amending of the constitution. 

 

Libya

President Barack Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron have indicated that they are bracing for a long battle in Libya, not just to remove Col. Qaddafi from power, but to guide the burgeoning democracy movement in other Arab states to a successful conclusion.

 

NATO leaders have decided against bombing Libya’s infrastructure, an idea voiced by many officials, including Britain top military commander, Gen. Sir David Richards. President Obama has urged patience, underscoring that the combination of bombing, sanctions, and import cutoff will force Qaddafi from power.

 

Following the Summit meeting in France, G8 leaders declared that “Qaddafi and the Libyan government have failed to fulfill their responsibilities to protect the Libyan population and have lost all legitimacy. [Qaddafi] has no future in a free, democratic Libya. He must go.”  Russia agreed to this formulation after initial objections. 

 

Morocco

Last Sunday, Moroccan authorities detained several demonstrators who were protesting under the banner of “insistence on change.” Prominent Moroccan human rights advocates expressed indignation at the treatment of protesters by security forces, considering it to be an escalation of repressive methods toward peaceful protests and a sign of the regime’s lack of determination to effectuate democratic change. The opposition movement is organizing a nation-wide protest on June 5 in response to these arrests. 

 

Moroccan security forces have accused the 20th February movement—which is demanding constitutional reforms—of violating the law, claiming that the movement has become an umbrella cover for extremists, from the left and right, who are calling for the downfall of the regime. Officials have, however, denied allegations that the government has decided to forbid the movement from protesting. 

 

Bahrain

Sources suggest that the opposition plans to resume protests for democratic reforms as soon as the emergency law is lifted on June 1.

 

According to reports, Saudi officials have approached Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Central Asian states to lend diplomatic support and, possibly, military assistance to the Gulf Cooperation Council’s presence in Bahrain. Saudi national security adviser, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, has reportedly asked for Pakistani support in Bahrain, including the possible integration of Pakistani troops into the approximately 4000 Saudis already posted there. Malaysia has already indicated its willingness to send troops to Bahrain. 

 

Saudi Arabia

Protesters in eastern Saudi Arabia, an area mostly populated by Saudi Shiites, believed their movement would spread to other parts of the country, but the protests remained confined to the East. The youth movement ended its protests there, following pressure from community elders and the arrests of 150 demonstrators. Activists believe that the protests for democratic reforms and an end to sectarian discrimination will eventually resume. Riyadh remains concerned that Iran is manipulating Shiite sentiments and the desire for reforms in order to further Iranian foreign policy objectives. 

 

Manal al-Sharif—an information technology expert—was detained for five days on Sunday on charges of disturbing public order. Sharif was arrested while driving in the eastern city of Dammam with her brother sitting next to her, challenging the law that forbids Saudi females from driving.

 

Her arrest has been highlighted on both Facebook and Twitter, with a call to Saudi women to drive en masse on June 17. The campaign has so far attracted 12,000 followers on Facebook. Saudi Arabia is the only country that forbids women from driving. The Saudi government wants to prevent the rise of a movement, using social media having observed similar protest movements in other Arab states. An online petition to free Sharif, addressed to King Abdullah, has attracted more than 600 signatures by both men and women.

“inner domain in which we can rehearse telephone numbers to ourselves or, more interestingly,
in which we carry on the narrative of our lives. It is usually thought to include inner speech
and visual imagery.” Baars uses the term “consciousness” to refer to the contents of working
memory — a theoretical commitment that is not part of the CogPrime design. In this section
we will use the term “consciousness” in Baars’ way, but not throughout the rest of the book.

Baars conceives working memory and consciousness in terms of a “theater metaphor” — ac-
cording to which, in the “theater of consciousness” a “spotlight of selective attention” shines
a bright spot on stage. The bright spot reveals the global workspace — the contents of con-
sciousness, which may be metaphorically considered as a group of actors moving in and out of
consciousness, making speeches or interacting with each other. The unconscious is represented
by the audience watching the play ... and there is also a role for the director (the mind’s ex-
ecutive processes) behind the scenes, along with a variety of helpers like stage hands, script
writers, scene designers, etc.

GWT describes a fleeting memory with a duration of a few seconds. This is much shorter
than the 10-30 seconds of classical working memory — according to GWT there is a very brief
“cognitive cycle” in which the global workspace is refreshed, and the time period an item remains
in working memory generally spans a large number of these elementary “refresh” actions. GWT
contents are proposed to correspond to what we are conscious of, and are said to be broadcast
to a multitude of unconscious cognitive brain processes. Unconscious processes, operating in
parallel, can form coalitions which can act as input processes to the global workspace. Each
unconscious process is viewed as relating to certain goals, and seeking to get involved with
coalitions that will get enough importance to become part of the global workspace — because
once they’re in the global workspace they’ll be allowed to broadcast out across the mind as a
whole, which include broadcasting to the internal and external actuators that allow the mind
to do things. Getting into the global workspace is a process’s best shot at achieving its goals.

Obviously, the theater metaphor used to describe the GWT is evocative but limited; for
instance, the unconscious in the mind does a lot more than the audience in a theater. The
unconscious comes up with complex creative ideas sometimes, which feed into consciousness —
almost as if the audience is also the scriptwriter. Baars’ theory, with its understanding of uncon-
scious dynamics in terms of coalition-building, fails to describe the subtle dynamics occurring
within the various forms of long-term memory, which result in subtle nonlinear interactions
between long term memory and working memory. But nevertheless, GWT successfully models
a number of characteristics of consciousness, including its role in handling novel situations, its
limited capacity, its sequential nature, and its ability to trigger a vast range of unconscious
brain processes. It is the framework on which LIDA’s theory of the cognitive cycle is built.

4.5.9 The LIDA Cognitive Cycle

The simplest cognitive cycle is that of an animal, which senses the world, compares sensation to
memory, and chooses an action, all in one fluid subjective moment. But the same cognitive cycle
structure/process applies to higher-level cognitive processes as well. The LIDA architecture is
based on the LIDA model of the cognitive cycle, which posits a particular structure underlying
the cognitive cycle that possess the generality to encompass both simple and complex cognitive
moments.

New book paints sordid picture of Trump real estate 
deal involving Russian oligarch and Jeffrey Epstein

A new book claims Jeffrey Epstein played a key role in a shady Palm Beach real estate deal between President 
Donald Trump and a Russian oligarch. 
Michael Wolff's forthcoming book, Siege, details the 2004 property deal that involved the future president, 
Deutsche Bank, a child predator and an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, reported The Guardian. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030989 
ADVERTISING 
According to Wolff's account, Epstein showed his friend Trump a $55 million mansion he planned to buy, but 
Trump instead went behind his back to buy the foreclosed property for about $40 million. 
Epstein didn't believe Trump could raise that much money on his own, through an entity called Trump 
Properties LLC that was entirely financed by Deutsche Bank, Wolff wrote. 
The billionaire financier knew Trump had been loaning out his name in real estate deals for a fee, and he 
suspected the freshly minted reality TV star was fronting for the mansion's real owners. 
74-.PUP. 
Epstein threatened to expose the deal until he found himself under investigation by Palm Beach police for child 
sex abuse and human trafficking, and he eventually served 13 months in county jail as part of a controversial 
plea agreement brokered by Trump's future Labor Secretary Alex Acosta. 
Trump later put the mansion on the market for $125 million, despite making only minor improvements to the 
property. 
It was purchased for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Kremlin-linked industrialist — which meant Trump 
made $55 million on the deal despite risking none of his own money. 
Wolff offers two possible theories for the deal. 
The author suspects that Trump may have earned a fee for hiding a shadow owner who possibly was funneled 
cash by Rybolovlev for reasons beyond the property's value. 
Or, Wolff theorizes, Rybolovlev essentially bought the house from himself, with Trump as an intermediary, to 
launder ill-gotten money. 
This, Wolff wrote, was Donald Trump's world of real estate. 
Rybolovlev tore down the mansion in 2016 and sold off the property as three lots for less than the $115 million 
he had invested in it.

Making having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a more
humane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more
children, because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation.
Humans are a hardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given
population die.

I suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate
change itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But who knows, I
might be wrong.

The radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized
organism is fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if
someone could pull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a
virus that everybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very
uncomfortable (I visited KZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans
inoculated ourselves very thoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider
it.

I rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series The Man in the High Castle, which explores
what would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as
a brutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not
a flat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book Starship Troopers explores fascism,
too, but unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order.

I find your political incorrectness very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly
signaling, but now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in
your youth? Did you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person
you want to transform into.

It was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything
remotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether democracy still
works, and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others,
hard in oneself. A speaker felt that the media stifle all criticism of Trump, another wanted to remove men
and Elon Musk from government, and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016256.txt,"In 2005, George Dyson, a historian of science and technology, visited Google at the
invitation of some Google engineers. The occasion was the sixtieth anniversary of John
von Neumann's proposal for a digital computer. After the visit, George wrote an essay,
“Turing’s Cathedral,” which, for the first time, alerted the public about what Google 's
founders had in store for the world. “We are not scanning all those books to be read by
people,” explained one of his hosts after his talk. “We are scanning them to be read by
an Al.”

George offers a counternarrative to the digital age. His interests have included
the development of the Aleut kayak, the evolution of digital computing and
telecommunications, the origins of the digital universe, and a path not taken into space.
His career (he never finished high school, yet has been awarded an honorary doctorate
jrom the University of Victoria) has proved as impossible to classify as his books.

He likes to point out that analog computing, once believed to be as extinct as the
differential analyzer, has returned. He argues that while we may use digital components,
at a certain point the analog computing being performed by the system far exceeds the
complexity of the digital code with which it is built. He believes that true artificial
intelligence—with analog control systems emerging from a digital substrate the way
digital computers emerged out of analog components in the aftermath of World War II—
may not be as far off as we think.

In this essay, George contemplates the distinction between analog and digital
computation and finds analog to be alive and well. Nature’s response to an attempt to
program machines to control everything may be machines without programming over
which no one has control.

castrucci, admonishments,- though my involvement in those - in one instance only gave a name - in
another only given an eileen dictated choice btween two 250k preparers. and for castrucci, I actually
sent emails that 1 take no responsiblity for his being hired. - however you felt strongly that I should be
saddled with their outcomes .even with brad wechsler , i again said two months in, Leon, he doesnt get
it. I tell you this so that you will understand that I will not interview, recommend or vet any new hire.

A story - In 1993 trump and I had a friend that kept telling his pilots how to fly , and when to fly , he
couldnt help himself from hiring morons as co pilots, and maintenance people based on cheapest rates.
Donald and I tried and tried to talk some sense into him, to no avail. Donald and I were in aspen, sitting
at little nells. when the friends plane crashed into the side of aspen mountain , klliing him and all on
board,- Trump looked at me and said without a blink , I guess NOW he wishes he would have listened to
us.- a metaphor for your office.. . had we not waited to the very last hour having had a six month
window and tens of unasnwered text and emails re decisions needed including the 1031. you would have
saved way more than you often feel obliged to argue about. . silly but 1 reallize you are stressed.

Barry will need to sit with brad for months, to absorb all the co's , structures. cash flow, financial
statments etc. I will present barry my thoughts on the overall redo , it will be the exact same email that i
presented to you and brad two years.ago . accurate numbers first. and foremost. . ( last week gaming
report stil funky). IT etc I pointed out some of the more glaring errors to barry to give him a flavor of
what is to come.

Tuesday if you like we should discuss Giacometti , and pesner ._ difficult to finesse him if they are
filing documents that you won't. these ridiculous conversations with tons of people on the phone ,
removes any claim you might have to not be considered a WILLFUL NON-FILER . ( after youve been
told by attnys and pwe that you should file in writing , you have NO choice ) ... worst possible result -
including serious penalties up the kazoo.

Leon,

Yesterday , again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get
flavor) and you and 1 will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other
weeks spent doing the things that I don;t have the time to do.

In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you,

might be helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500
million dollars per year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments,
in various categories ,a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range
of all types of taxes. , planes. boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no
oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants.
construction consultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of Ilc's , including foreign, and with
all that you only have a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars.

I have previously sent you the very same note that 1 have enclosed again below ,this time with
highlights . I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to
have been raised as one of your concerns , as arule I try to memorialize things in writing in an
attempt to lay out issues that I fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what 1 would and wouldn't

about it. When we looked at light passing through water or built
a boat to travel on it, we were discovering, not inventing. Shipwrights did
not invent boats they were simply building inevitable forms. Everything

Greek playwrights were busy ‘creating the first plays; tragedies, comedies
and the like, but serious thinkers thought of them as documenting the
human condition. It wasn't until the Renaissance, 1500 years later, that
humans began to appreciate that they create knowledge, and this started
us on our quest to understand creativity.

a glass of water and surrounded by knives and milk bottles. I was trying
to solve one of the problems from Edward de Bono’s book on lateral

international condemnation of his invasion by threatening Israel. He said “all
issues of occupation” were on the table — the West Bank and Gaza, the Golan
Heights, and Lebanon — and vowed to “let our fire eat half of Israel” in a future
war. And we could not assume this was mere rhetoric. Iraq had an arsenal of
Soviet-made ballistic missiles. Called Scuds, they were not always accurate at
long range. But they could reach Israeli towns and cities, and could carry not
just conventional explosives but chemical warheads. Moreover, Saddam had
used chemical weapons: during the Iran-Iraq war, and to kill thousands of his
own restive Kurdish population in the town of Halabja in the spring of 1988.

Even the prospect of American military action seemed not to faze him.
Hours into the invasion, he moved an armored force toward Kuwait’s border
with Saudi Arabia, a key US regional ally, immediately prompting the President
George Bush’s administration to go beyond mere verbal condemnation. With
Saudi agreement, Washington dispatched a squadron of F-15s to the kingdom —
the first step in what would become a huge American land, sea and air force to
face down Saddam and force him out of Kuwait.

Given the credible threat of Scud missile attacks on Israel, Dan immediately
assigned me to coordinate our assessment and evaluation of what Saddam was
likely to do in the event of a US-led attack, and what defense arrangements or
Israeli military response would be necessary. We knew we’d be under strong
pressure from the Americans to stay out of any war. Israeli involvement would
be a political gift to Saddam, allowing him to convert a conflict over his
aggression against an Arab neighbor into a “defense” against “Israeli
occupation.” But we had a primary responsibility to protect our citizens.

I was now working with a new Israeli government. After Shimon Peres tried
and failed to topple the unity coalition in the spring of 1990, Shamir had formed
a Likud-led government shorn of both Peres and Rabin. Misha Arens was again
Minister of Defense. I began preparing regular, fortnightly reports for him, Dan
and Prime Minister Shamir. Within days of the invasion, I produced my initial
assessment. The bottom line was that we had to assume there would be a war. It
was impossible to imagine the Americans would commit hundreds of thousands
of troops and simply bring them home again, unless Saddam succumbed and
retreated. I was equally certain Saddam would use his Scuds against us. He’d
figure the benefits of trying to bring Israel into the conflict far outweighed the
risk of retaliation. But I was “nearly 100 per-cent sure” he wouldn’t use
chemical warheads, since that would almost guarantee an Israeli military

starting to run into limits imposed by basic physics. The clock speed of computers
maxed out at a few gigahertz a decade and a half ago, simply because the chips were
starting to melt. The miniaturization of transistors is already running into quantum-
mechanical problems due to tunneling and leakage currents. Eventually, the various
exponential improvements in memory and processing driven by Moore’s Law will
grind to a halt. A few more decades, however, will probably be time enough for the
raw information-processing power of computers to match that of brains—at least by
the crude measures of number of bits and number of bit-flips per second.

Human brains are intricately constructed, the process of millions of years of
natural selection. In Wiener’s time, our understanding of the architecture of the brain
was rudimentary and simplistic. Since then, increasingly sensitive instrumentation and
imaging techniques have shown our brains to be far more varied in structure and
complex in function than Wiener could have imagined. I recently asked Tomaso
Poggio, one of the pioneers of modern neuroscience, whether he was worried that
computers, with their rapidly increasing processing power, would soon emulate the
functioning of the human brain. “Not a chance,” he replied.

The recent advances in deep learning and neuromorphic computation are very
good at reproducing a particular aspect of human intelligence focused on the operation
of the brain’s cortex, where patterns are processed and recognized. These advances
have enabled a computer to beat the world champion not just of chess but of Go, an
impressive feat, but they’re far short of enabling a computerized robot to tidy a room.
(In fact, robots with anything approaching human capability in a broad range of
flexible movements are still far away—search “robots falling down.” Robots are good
at making precision welds on assembly lines, but they still can’t tie their own shoes.)

Raw information-processing power does not mean sophisticated information-
processing power. While computer power has advanced exponentially, the programs
by which computers operate have often failed to advance at all. One of the primary
responses of software companies to increased processing power is to add “useful”
features which often make the software harder to use. Microsoft Word reached its
apex in 1995 and has been slowly sinking under the weight of added features ever
since. Once Moore’s Law starts slowing down, software developers will be confronted
with hard choices between efficiency, speed, and functionality.

A major fear of the singulariteers is that as computers become more involved in
designing their own software they’! rapidly bootstrap themselves into achieving
superhuman computational ability. But the evidence of machine learning points in the
opposite direction. As machines become more powerful and capable of learning, they
learn more and more as human beings do—from multiple examples, often under the
supervision of human and machine teachers. Education is as hard and slow for
computers as it is for teenagers. Consequently, systems based on deep learning are
becoming more rather than less human. The skills they bring to learning are not
“better than” but “complementary to” human learning: Computer learning systems can
identify patterns that humans cannot—and vice versa. The world’s best chess players
are neither computers nor humans but humans working together with computers.
Cyberspace is indeed inhabited by harmful programs, but these primarily take the form
of malware—viruses notable for their malign mindlessness, not for their

PERCEPTION/ ACTION
SUBSYSTEMS

Fig. 5.2: Architecture of Working Memory and Reactive Processing, closely modeled on the
LIDA architecture

Figure 5.3, modeling motivation and action selection, is a lightly modified version of the
Psi diagram from Joscha Bach’s book Principles of Synthetic Intelligence [Bac09|. The main
difference from Psi is that in the integrative diagram the Psi motivated action framework is
embedded in a larger, more complex cognitive model. Psi comes with its own theory of working
and long-term memory, which is related to but different from the one given in the integrative
diagram — it views the multiple memory types distinguished in the integrative diagram as
emergent from a common memory substrate. Psi comes with its own theory of perception and
action, which seems broadly consistent with the deep learning approach incorporated in the
integrative diagram. Psi’s handling of working memory lacks the detailed, explicit workflow of
LIDA, though it seems broadly conceptually consistent with LIDA.

In Figure 5.3, the box labeled Other portions of working memory is labeled Protocol and
situation memory in the original Psi diagram. The Perception, Action Execution and Action
Selection boxes have fairly similar semantics to the similarly labeled boxes in the LIDA-like
Figure 5.2, so that these diagrams may be viewed as overlapping. The LIDA model doesn’t
explain action selection and planning in as much detail as Psi, so the Psi-like Figure 5.3 could
be viewed as an elaboration of the action-selection portion of the LIDA-like Figure 5.2. In
Psi, reinforcement is considered as part of the learning process involved in action selection and
planning; in Figure 5.3 an explicit reinforcement box has been added to the original Psi
diagram, to emphasize this.

Figure 5.4, modeling long-term memory and deliberative processing, is derived from our own
prior work studying the cognitive synergy between different cognitive processes associated
with different types of memory. The division into types of memory is fairly standard. Declarative,
procedural, episodic and sensorimotor memory are routinely distinguished; we like to distinguish
attentional memory and intentional (goal) memory as well, and view these as the interface
between long-term memory and the mind’s global control systems. One focus of our AGI design
work has been on designing learning algorithms, corresponding to these various types of memory,

= In addition to speculation, which has been the biggest driver of cryptocurrency appreciation, other drivers include:

= Perceived Scarcity: Bitcoin’s 21 million token cap is expected to be reached in 2140 (16.5 million today). Many of the
over 2,000 other cryptocurrencies, however, do not have a capped supply. Further, while unlikely, bitcoin’s token cap
could be raised if a consensus of programmers decided so.

= Desired Safe-haven: Increased global participation reflects desire for an asset independent from governments or central
banks (“digital gold”). Many governments from which investors have sought diversification, however, have recently
banned domestic crypto-exchanges.

Parties See Obama’s Israel Policy as
Wedge for 2012

Jackie Calmes and Helene Cooper

May 25, 2011 — Few issues in American politics are as bipartisan as
support for Israel. Yet the question of whether President Obama is
supportive enough is behind some of the most partisan maneuvering
since the Middle East ally was born six decades ago, and that angling
has potential ramifications for the 2012 elections.

The visit of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in the past
week captured just how aggressively Republicans are stoking doubts
about Mr. Obama. Republican Congressional leaders and presidential
aspirants lavished praise on Mr. Netanyahu as quickly as they had
condemned Mr. Obama for proposing that Israel’s 1967 borders, with
mutually agreed land swaps, should be a basis for negotiating peace
with the Palestinians.

Republicans do not suggest that they can soon break the Democratic
Party’s long hold on the loyalty of Jewish-American voters; Mr.
Obama got nearly 8 of 10 such voters in 2008. But what Republicans
do see is the potential in 2012 to diminish the millions of dollars,
volunteer activism and ultimately the votes that Mr. Obama and his
party typically get from American Jews — support that is
disproportionate to their numbers.

While Jewish Americans are just 2 percent of the electorate
nationally, they are “strategically concentrated,” as Mark Mellman, a
Democratic pollster, put it, in several swing states that are critical in
presidential elections. Those states include Florida — which in 2000

populations above 30 million. To prevent megacities becoming turbulent dystopias
will surely be a major challenge to governance.

Population growth seems currently under-discussed. That is maybe because doom-
laden forecasts in the 1970s, by the Club of Rome, Paul Erlich and others, have
proved off the mark. Up till now, food production has more than kept pace — famines
stem from wars or mal-distribution, not overall shortage. And it’s deemed by some a
taboo subject -- tainted by association with eugenics in the 1920s and 30s, with Indian
policies under Indira Gandhi, and more recently with China's hard-line one-child

policy.

Can the Earth ‘carry’ 9 billion people? There seems no need for gloom or panic on
this front... Improved agriculture — low-till, water-conserving, and perhaps involving
GM crops could feed that number by mid-century. The buzz-phrase is ‘sustainable
intensification’.

But lifestyle changes are needed. The world couldn't sustain even its present
population if everyone lived like Americans do today— using as much energy and
eating as much beef.

Population trends beyond 2050 are harder to predict. They will depend on what
people as yet unborn decide about the number and spacing of their children.
Enhanced education and empowerment of women -- surely a benign priority in
itself -- reduces fertility rates.

But the demographic transition hasn’t reached parts of India and Sub-Saharan Africa.
If families in Africa remain large,, then according to the UN that continent’s
population could double again by 2100, to 4 billion, thereby raising the global
population to 11 billion. Nigeria alone would by then have as big a population as
Europe and North America combined, and almost half of all the world’s children
would be in Africa.

Optimists remind us that each extra mouth brings also two hands and a brain.
Nonetheless the higher the population becomes, the greater will be all pressures on
resources, especially if the developing world narrows its gap with the developed
world in its per capita consumption. So we must surely hope that the global figure
declines rather than rises after 2050.

Moreover, if humanity’s collective impact on nature pushes too hard against what
Johan Rockstrom calls ‘planetary boundaries’, the resultant ‘ecological shock’ could

politics and culture, about which he has written widely.

In the first meeting (in Washington, Connecticut) that preceded the crafting of this
book, he commented on the change in how “information” is viewed since Wiener’s time:
the military-industrial, Cold War era. Back then, Wiener compared information,
metaphorically, to entropy, in that it could not be conserved—i.e., monopolized; thus, he
argued, our atomic secrets and other such classified matters would not remain secrets for
long. Today, whereas (as Wiener might have expected) information, fake or not, is
leaking all over the other Washington, information in the economic world has indeed
been stockpiled, commodified, and monetized.

This lockdown, David said, was “not all good, not all bad’”—depending, I guess,
on whether you’re sick of being pestered by ads for socks or European river cruises
popping up in your browser minutes after you’ve bought them.

To say nothing of information’s proliferation. David complained to the rest of us
attending the meeting that in Wiener’s time, physicists could “take the entire Physical
Review. /t would sit comfortably in front of us in a manageable pile. Now we’re awash
in fifty thousand open-source journals per minute,” full of god-knows-what. Neither of
these developments would Wiener have anticipated, said David, prompting him to ask,

“Do we need a new set of guiding metaphors?”

See Tab 6, a.

e Mr. Epstein did not engage in luring.

o Mr. Epstein’s message books show that several masseuses would regularly
call Mr. Epstein’s assistants, without any prompting by Mr. Epstein or his
assistants, asking to visit Mr. Epstein at his home.

o MRE stated “a lot of gitls begged me to bring them back [to Mr.
Epstein’s house].”

e There was no alcohol or drugs involved, a fact that is not in dispute.
¢ Mr. Epstein has no prior criminal history, a fact that is not in dispute.
¢ These women do not see themselves as victims.

© MR indicated under oath that the FBI attempted to persuade her that
she was in fact a “victim” of federal crimes when she herself repeatedly
confirmed that she was not. See Tab 14. p. 9-12 and Tab 15,

BE. B, p. 7.

Conclusion

Jeffrey Epstein, a self-made businessman with no prior criminal history, should not be
prosecuted federally for conduct that amounts to, the solicitation of prostitution. A federal
prosecution based on these facts would be an unprecedented exercise of federal power, a misuse
of federal resources, and a prosecution that would carry with it the appearance, if not the reality,
of unwarranted selectivity given the incongruity between the facts as developed in this matter
and the factual paradigms for all other reported federal prosecutions under each of the three
statutes being considered. It would require the pursuit of a novel legal theory never before
sanctioned by federal law—and that indeed is inconsistent with each of the statutes prosecutors
have identified. Accordingly, we respectfully request that you direct the U.S. Attomey’s Office
for the Southern District of Florida to discontinue its involvement in this matter, and return
responsibility for this case to the State of Florida.

As market observers attempt to explain the recent drop in US equities, the risks of geopolitical factors
have garnered considerable attention. Potential US retaliation over the recent disappearance of a
Saudi journalist has only added fuel to the fire of worries given the risk that oil exports could be used
as a political weapon in a world with tighter oil supply thanks to impending US sanctions on Iran.

As we review the geopolitical developments of 2018, it is clear that some of the risks have abated
while others have increased. With the exception of a significant spike in oil prices due to the impact of
sanctions on Iran or any escalation in US-Saudi tensions, we believe that the net impact of these
shifts is not material enough to derail the US economic expansion or bull market.

Risks that have abated

Mexico: the election of the left-of-center populist president (Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador referred
to as AMLO) has reduced fear of a reversal of recent reforms. While concerns about fiscal profligacy
and reverting to a nationalist energy policy that reduces oil production may reappear, AMLO does not
take office until the end of the year.

Brazil: The strong showing of Jair Bolsonaro, a law-and-order former army captain, in the first round
of elections and the latest data that points to a 75% probability of Bolsonaro becoming the next
president of Brazil has provided a boost to the Brazilian real. His current standing has substantially
reduced the election of another left-wing worker’s party candidate who would keep the status quo in
Brazil.

NAFTA: The agreement on a revised NAFTA deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico on
September 30th meaningfully reduced the risk of the US withdrawal from NAFTA. While the new
agreement, US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), has not been ratified by the Mexican and
Canadian national parliaments nor by the US congress, and a divided congress after the mid-term
elections may lead to some uncertainty, we believe it is likely to be ratified.

US-EU Trade Friction: Tension between the US and European Union eased significantly after a July
2018 deal between European Commission President Juncker and President Trump to “work together
toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods”. The
coast is not totally clear given the threat of auto tariffs, but we do not anticipate any significant
increase in trade rhetoric in the near future.

Risks that have increased

China: The trade war with China continues to escalate and as we have stated before, we believe that
it cannot be resolved simply by China importing more US goods. The issues range from:

e A large and growing trade deficit with China

e Industrial policies & unfair trade practices that reduce competition, such as subsidies and
“dumping good at below-market prices”

e “Made in China 2025” policies which “harm US companies”

Hi Jeffrey 
Happy to talk to you almost anytime today until around 3PM. Just tell me what number I should reach. 
Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or 
anything of the kind. 
All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their 
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already 
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect 
in person. 
The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source. 
Once again, not sure was drifted away from this in communication

but it certainly is not anything that there is going to be any

real evidence about in this case.

The next two LiButti factors, the next one relates to
any interest in the outcome of the litigation. Again,
Mr. Cassell has to manufacture some interest here. These folks
are not defendants in this case, these witnesses. They have no
financial interest. They have no ties. There is no joint
defense agreement. There is no indemnification agreement.

There is nothing. They have absolutely no dog in this fight,

again, which is no interest in the litigation.

There's just really nothing that would allow any

adverse inference in this case one way or the other.
Finally, your Honor -- well, two final points. The

questioning, you know, the kind of questions that were posed to

these witnesses were precisely the kind of questions that have

been disapproved in the Second Circuit. And that's Brink's

Inc. v. City of New York, which is in the papers; WorldCom

Security Litigation, also in the papers; and LiButti itself.

These are not technical objections. It serves no legitimate
evidentiary purpose for a lawyer to come in and simply ask a

very bunch of highly charged, leading questions to which they

know the witness is going to say, I take the Fifth. There is
no evidentiary ball advanced with those questions, because it's
just lawyer argument that doesn't do anything for anybody. So

absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.” The statement provided for publication by
Defendant Trump was published by said website and has been republished elsewhere in whole or
in part numerous times (and similar statements of an attorney for Defendant Trump were also
published). The statement provided for publication by Defendant Trump and that was published
by said websites is false as it pertains to Plaintiff.

28. The published statement is libelous on its face, and clearly exposes Plaintiff to
hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy.

29. As a proximate result of the above-described publication, Plaintiff has suffered
loss of her reputation, shame, mortification, and injury to her feelings, all to her damage in an
amount to be established by proof at trial.

30. The above-described publication was not privileged because it was published by
Defendant Trump with malice, hatred and ill will toward Plaintiff and the desire to injure her.

31. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant Trump’s defamation of Plaintiff,

Plaintiff has been subjected to public scorn, hatred, and ridicule and has suffered other injury.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendants and for the
following relief:
A. That judgment be entered against Defendants for special damages, compensatory
damages, and punitive damages in an amount which shall be shown to be reasonable and just by
the evidence and in excess of Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), exclusive of interests

After the new Parliament and president are elected, the provisional
Constitution allows (and, according to a reading endorsed by a SCAF
member, actually requires) a constituent assembly to be selected to
draft an entirely new Constitution. While the opponents to the
amendments wished to have this done as the first rather than the last
step, they will ultimately get their wish for an entirely new document.

view, as well as Keynes’, that his “attempted saving” means gross saving (gross
income less consumption) not invested in new productive assets. That can be

written as

Keynesian attempted saving - transfer payments

= Keynesian net saving = Keynesian net investment,

at any scale.

| accept Keynes’ definition of transfer payments, and | recognize the importance of
his distinction of those from investment in new productive assets which put idle
plant and workers to work. My interpretation, even so, is that it is better to leave
them idle than to put them to work unproductively. Keynes made his opposite view
crystal-clear with his brilliant tongue-in-cheek parable of money buried in
mineshafts and idle workers hired to dig it up. He had a sense of theater as well as a
great mind. And he just might have been right. But I think my way of putting things
encompasses that possibility. His mineshaft scenario works if it somehow

maximizes return in the big picture.

My language differs from Keynes’ in several ways. I prefer Myrdal’s ex ante - ex post
dichotomy, published three years after the General Theory, to Keynes’ equivalent
attempted-realized one. Like Myrdal, and unlike Keynes, I apply it to investment as
well as saving. That’s why | treat them as synonymous. And | prefer to recognize
human capital explicitly. Keynes surely understood the concept. He was the star
pupil of Alfred Marshall's later teaching career, unless he shared that distinction
with his lifelong personal friend and professional adversary Arthur Pigou, and
Marshall and Pigou both describe human capital in principle. Marshall wrote that he
neglected it as something outside what he saw as the main sequence ending with
consumption. Keynes could have agreed, or could have meant to provide for it

implicitly by defining output as investment plus consumption while realizing that

Most scientists believe communication between humans is classical:
words spoken in proximity have no more power than had we carefully
written out what we wanted to say. Body language and tone of voice are
simply useful tools to aid the transmission of this information. I’m going
to explore the ways in which human face-to-face communication might
exceed this traditional classical model. Let us look first at the bandwidth
of communication between people.

Bandwidth

Let me give you a mental picture for what I mean by bandwidth. Imagine
Iam sitting in a darkened theatre enjoying one of my favorite comedians
at the Edinburgh Festival — the biggest arts festival in the world. I phone
a friend who is also a fan and let them listen in. Perhaps I even use the
camera and surreptitiously point the phone at the comedian. My live
experience is digitized, compressed and transmitted over the mobile
network to my friend. He gets the same experience but at much-reduced
bandwidth.

My friend has a similar but qualitatively different experience to
mine. He cannot hear the degrees of loud and soft I hear, nor the full
range of high and low frequencies forming the timbre of the comedian’s
voice; no sense of the smell of old armchairs or the heat of the audience
around me. He is spared the strange stickiness my shoes meet on the
floor of the auditorium and the occasional slosh of beer that hits me
froma slightly inebriated neighbor. For the person at the other end of the
phone, their view is of a tiny two-dimensional screen about 4 by 3 inches
square. Of course, they can enlarge the picture, but then the pixilation
dominates and it looks like an impressionist picture viewed close up. He
has nothing like the same intensity of experience. Loss of bandwidth is
something we can study mathematically and the reduction is enormous.

Video and Audio

The image of the comedy show is digitized by the camera and
microphone; the video at 384,000 bits per second and the audio at 64,000
bps. Mathematical compression will be applied and the video will shrink
to 30,000 while the audio drops down to 4,700. After compression, the
whole experience amounts to around 40,000 bits per second. To put it in
some perspective, a DVD would be 11.5 million bits per second, nearly
300 times the bandwidth.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028093.txt,"But there were times of crisis, and high tension, as well. Only five months
after the election, Rabin and I faced one of the most painful periods during my
entire time as chief of staff. It began with the gruesome death of five Sayeret
Matkal soldiers during a training exercise in the Negev desert. I’d made
preventing such accidents a top priority. By the end of the 1980s, they were
claiming as many as 80 lives a year. During Dan’s tenure, we’d brought the
number down to about 35. But I knew we had to do more. When I’d addressed
the officers after becoming chief of staff, I told them: “Parents are giving us
their children in order to allow us to protect the country. They know there is risk
involved. But they expect their children not to be brought home in coffins
because of our own negligence, or stupidity.” What happened at the military
base of Tze’elim in the Negev on November 5, 1992 was not only a reminder of
how far we still had to go, however. It occurred during a dry run for an
operation unlike any that Israel had ever considered. For that and other reasons,
it would erupt into a major political controversy.

Though the reason for the exercise was meant to have remained a closely
guarded secret, foreign newspaper reports in the weeks after the training
accident made secrecy impossible. We were planning to infiltrate a Sayeret
Matkal unit into Iraq, and to kill Saddam Hussein.

The Gulf War had blunted any immediate threat from Iraq. But Saddam had
proven he could launch missiles into the heart of Israel. We knew from our
intelligence reports that, in addition to his unabated desire to acquire nuclear
arms, he retained facilities to produce chemical weapons. He was trying to
acquire and develop new biological weapons. In fact, the Iraqis had actually
acknowledged a biological weapons program to UN inspectors, claiming it was
for “defensive purposes.”

The idea for an attack on Saddam had first been raised a year earlier, when
my former Sayeret Matkal comrade, Amiram Levin, asked to see me. He was
between military postings, but had come up with the outline of a plan he felt
would allow us to isolate Saddam during a public appearance and kill him. With
my approval, he and a small group of officers in the sayeret began working
further on the idea, with the initial aim of seeing whether it was really workable.
Since Misha was still Defense Minister, I briefed him on what we were doing. I

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028087.txt,"fully detailed picture of the progress of the SAS action, skeptics and hawks in
the cabinet were inclined to see a glass half-empty. They continued to press for
Israeli military action.

In a rare public statement, I tried to reassure the country we did have a
military option, but also to urge restraint. I pointed out that the number of Scuds
had begun decreasing. Though the threat had not been eliminated altogether, we
had “very good operational plans” that would be “carried out when and if the
Israeli government instructs us to implement them.” Yet I added a caveat. “On
the political level, fingers are itching to carry out operations which, in our
opinion, can remove the threat. But in the complex situation created by this war,
neither anger, hurt, nor itchy fingers can replace rational thinking.”

The American ground invasion did turn out to be swift and decisive. In
Israel, Scud attacks continued for a few more days. But the last two missiles fell
in the Negev before dawn on February 25, among the very few to cause neither
casualties nor damage. We turned out to have been right in our pre-war
assessment about the number of missiles: around 40. Fortunately, the casualties
were far fewer than we’d anticipated. Not 120 dead, but fifteen, only one of
whom died directly because of a missile blast. The other deaths were the result
of understandable panic: the misuse of gas masks or the gas antidote drug
atropine, or from respiratory and cardiac failure. The physical damage,
however, was far greater than I’d anticipated. Buildings were destroyed. Cars
were crushed. Glass and debris flew everywhere. In financial terms, the cost ran
to hundreds of millions of dollars. The true impact was greater: on families who
saw the destruction not only their homes, but a lifetime of prized possessions.
For Holocaust survivors in particular, there was the almost unimaginable terror
of having to huddle in sealed rooms for fear of gas. And all Israelis had
experienced a new sense of vulnerability to a faraway enemy whom they
couldn’t see nor, apparently, stop.

I was due to become Israel’s 14 chief-of-staff at the start of April, barely a
month after the last Scud attack. As the handover drew nearer, I felt fortunate,
in a way, to have missed out on the job four years earlier. Not only had Dan
excelled as ramatkal. I'd benefited from his range of experience, his judgment,
and his trust as well. We had worked together truly as a team.

was the everyman. He was jazz (some, in the telling, made it rap), everybody else an
earnest folk music. In the other reality, in which resided most of his antagonists, his
virtues were grievous if not mental and criminal flaws. In this reality lived the media,
which, with its conclusion of a misbegotten and bastard presidency, believed it could
diminish him and wound him (and wind him up) and rob him of all credibility by
relentlessly pointing out how literally wrong he was.

The media, adopting a “shocked, shocked” morality, could not fathom how being
factually wrong was not an absolute ending in itself. How could this not utterly shame
him? How could his staff defend him? The facts were the facts! Defying them, or ignoring
them, or subverting them, made you a liar—intending to deceive, bearing false witness. (A
minor journalism controversy broke out about whether these untruths should be called
inaccuracies or lies.)

In Bannon’s view: (1) Trump was never going to change; (2) trying to get him to
change would surely cramp his style; (3) it didn’t matter to Trump supporters; (4) the
media wasn’t going to like him anyway; (5) it was better to play against the media than to
the media; (6) the media’s claim to be the protector of factual probity and accuracy was
itself a sham; (7) the Trump revolution was an attack on conventional assumptions and
expertise, so better to embrace Trump’s behavior than try to curb it or cure it.

The problem was that, for all he was never going to stick to a script (“his mind just
doesn’t work that way” was one of the internal rationalizations), Trump craved media
approval. But, as Bannon emphasized, he was never going to get the facts right, nor was
he ever going to acknowledge that he got them wrong, so therefore he was not going to get
that approval. This meant, next best thing, that he had to be aggressively defended against
the media’s disapproval.

The problem here was that the more vociferous the defense—mostly of assertions that
could easily be proved wrong—the more the media redoubled its attacks and censure.
What’s more, Trump was receiving the censure of his friends, too. And it was not only
calls from friends worried about him, but staffers calling people to call him and say
Simmer down. “Who do you have in there?” said Joe Scarborough in a frantic call. “Who’s
the person you trust? Jared? Who can talk you through this stuff before you decided to act
on it?”

“Well,” said the president, “you won’t like the answer, but the answer is me. Me. I talk

to myself.”

Hence, within twenty-four hours of the inauguration, the president had invented a
million or so people who did not exist. He sent his new press secretary, Sean Spicer—
whose personal mantra would shortly become “You can’t make this shit up’—to argue his
case in a media moment that turned Spicer, quite a buttoned-down political professional,

interesting. Am I conjuring up something that's not going to

happen? No, your Honor. The defendant's own expert report
described our client as a prostitute. Your Honor has under
advisement th xpert report from Dr. Esplin, and so I deposed

Dr. Esplin, and I said, Are you sure that's an accurate term

in the context of this case? Because we have a child who

cannot consent to sexual activities. And he backed off

immediately and agreed that that was an inaccurate term for him

to use to describe my client, Ms. Giuffre. So even the
defense's own expert says the term prostitute is
inappropriate.

Your Honor has authority, of course, under Rule 611 to

manage the trial, to avoid undue harassment or embarrassment.

Also Rule 403 allows you to restrict things that would be

substantially prejudicial with no probative value, which is

exactly what we have here. So we would ask you simply to reign
in derogatory language, both from witnesses and opposing
counsel.

MS. SCHULTZ: Your Honor, I'll be addressing the next

several points in the omnibus motion, starting with number 8.

I think I can narrow this issue a little bit at the outset.

Ms. Giuffre concedes here that illegal or
nonprescription use of drugs during the years that she was with
defendant is admissible. However, any evidence pertaining to

any use of drugs, illegal or not, and alcohol from any periods

https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2018/12/alex-acosta-update.php 
Alex Acosta update 
Earlier this week, pedophile Jeffrey Epstein bought his way out of a lawsuit that would 
have given some of his victims the opportunity to testify about his predatory and criminal 
conduct. Victims never got that opportunity when Epstein faced criminal charges, because 
Alex Acosta___then the lead prosecutor, now the Secretary of Labor___let Epstein off with 
a ridiculously lenient sentence. Despite having committed hideous sex offenses with dozens 
of minors, Epstein received a sentence of 13 months in jail, during which he was often free 
during the day. 
Epstein's decision to buy his out of the civil lawsuit, one that he had the nerve to initiate, 
benefits Acosta. The trial would have provided non-stop headlines, coupled with frequent 
references to the sweetheart deal Acosta gave him. As Randy Schultz puts it, the trial would 
have been the occasion for a long overdue public shaming of Acosta. Now, he avoids this 
consequence. 
But this doesn't mean Acosta is out of the woods. He faces calls for his ouster from the 
Trump cabinet. 
Some calls are from the usual suspects. Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times has 
written a piece so obnoxious that it almost makes me want to see Acosta ride out the storm. 
But some conservatives are also advocating Acosta's departure. Concerned Women for 
America is a stalwart conservative organization. It describes itself, accurately, as focus[ed] 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030962 
on seven core issues: the family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education, 
sexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel. (Emphasis added) 
Its leader, Penny Nance, has called for Acosta's resignation. Noting that labor trafficking, 
which the Labor Department combats, is often conjoined with sex trafficking, Nance says 
that President Trump would not have nominated Acosta if reports fully describing Acosta's 
conduct in the Epstein case had emerged earlier. 
Sen. Ben Sasse has also weighed in. He sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to 
investigate its treatment of Epstein, including the fact that the plea deal ensured that victims 
of the pervert would be denied the ability to comment on or object to the leniency of his 
sentence. Sasse is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight, 
Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts. 
Sen. Marco Rubio, a longtime supporter of Acosta, says it would be very troubling if 
political influence led to a light sentence for Epstein. In Rubio's view, and that of every 
rational person, Epstein should have been in jail for a long time. Rubio added, however, 
that he will reserve judgment until he hears Acosta's side. 
That's fair. But so far, Acosta has provided no real defense for letting Epstein off so lightly. 
In public, at least, he is standing by his argument that the deal was a reasonable one and that 
this is old news. 
Previously, Acosta had a different defense. He cited a year-long assault on the prosecution 
and the prosecutors by an army of legal superstars who represented Epstein. This 
allegedly included defense counsel investigat[ing] individual prosecutors and their 
families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification. In 
this account, the deal was made to relieve the pressure, while still getting a conviction. 
Acosta could hardly assert this explanation____i.e., that he wimped out___while seeking a 
cabinet position with the expectation of being appointed to more exalted jobs in the future. 
Nor is the explanation particularly plausible. Acosta isn't the first prosecutor to face a 
scorched earth defense. Ask Ken Starr about this. 
I don't doubt that Acosta regarded escaping the wrath of the defense team as a benefit of 
reaching the plea deal. But I don't believe this was incentive enough to cause him, in effect, 
to throw the case. 
What was the true incentive? As I wrote when this story broke, I think it was the same 
incentive that explains much of his conduct in public life___Acosta's desire to 
accommodate people he thinks can help him down the road. 
Which people? Probably the lawyers at Kirkland and Ellis, where Acosta had once worked. 
Epstein enlisted Ken Starr* and Jay Lefkowitz, both of Kirkland, for his defense team. 
Acosta reportedly worked out the terms of his surrender with Lefkowitz, a former 
colleague, at a meeting in a location far away from the prosecutor's office. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030963 
The location of the meeting is itself suspicious. Prosecutors and other law enforcement 
officials normally demand that those seeking a deal come to them. 
The fact that Acosta didn't is another sign___if one were needed___that this was a 
capitulation. It also casts further doubt on the claim that Acosta was capitulating for the 
purpose of sparing the folks who worked with him in the prosecutor's office. 
The key point, though, is that Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz were power players in 
Washington___men who might help Acosta down the road. 
Readers will be quite familiar with Starr's background. Lefkowitz was director of cabinet 
affairs and deputy executive secretary to the domestic policy council under President 
George H.W. Bush. Under President George W. Bush, Lefkowitz served as general counsel 
in the Office of Management and Budget and later as deputy director of domestic policy at 
the White House. 
Accommodating such influential figures must have seemed like a good career move. 
Having Starr and Lefkowitz on his side might help Acosta get a judgeship, a cabinet 
appointment, or a high-paying job back at Kirkland and Ellis. 
I'm speculating, of course. But my speculation finds support in Acosta's practice of 
accommodating the powerful. 
Much of that accommodation is of Democrats. Indeed, at the time Acosta was working in 
Miami as a U.S. Attorney, he had alienated some Republicans by such accommodation  
while at the Department of Justice. Some say he was on the verge of being fired when 
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez parachuted him to Miami. The Epstein settlement was a 
way for Acosta to shore up his standing with some influential Republicans. 
Will Acosta be able to survive the current scandal? I don't have a clear sense about this yet. 
But President Trump, who isn't bashful about sacking cabinet members, may come to 
believe (if he doesn't now) that it's disadvantageous to have a cabinet member who sold out 
teenage victims of sexual abuse, especially when the sell-out benefited an ultra-wealthy 
serial offender. 
* Some on the left are trying to make something or the fact that Starr, who had investigated 
Bill Clinton in connection with sexual misconduct, later defended Epstein, a pervert. This is 
silly. 
In both instances, Starr was doing his job as a lawyer. Perverts are entitled to a defense and 
there is nothing hypocritical about investigating Bill Clinton's misconduct when that was 
Starr's job and later joining the team that was defending Jeffrey Epstein. 
Acosta, by contrast, was on the team seeking justice for Epstein and for his victims. He 
gave up this quest for reasons that can't be defended.

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

Some comments argue that the
Board’s notice posting rule does not go
far enough to effectuate the NLRA. One
labor attorney argues that the Board
should require annual trainings for
supervisors and captive audience
meetings where employees are read
their rights by supervisors and Board
agents and the employees would have to
acknowledge receiving those notices.
The same comment suggests banning
captive audience meetings by
employers. The comment concludes that
the NPRM “‘doesn’t go anywhere near
far enough. It is, however, an important
and worthwhile advancement.” %
Another comment also suggests that
annual, mandatory training classes for
employees would be desirable.9° The
Board believes that this Rule strikes the
proper balance in communicating
necessary information about the NLRA
to employees.

For all the foregoing reasons, the
Board is persuaded that many private
sector employees are unaware of their
NLRA rights.96

III. Summary of Final Rule and
Discussion of Related Comments

The Board’s rule, which requires
employers subject to the NLRA to post
notices of employee rights under the
NLRA, will be set forth in Chapter 1,
Part 104 of Volume 29 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR). Subpart A of
the rule sets out definitions; prescribes
the size, form, and content of the
employee notice; and lists the categories
of employers that are not covered by the
rule. Subpart B sets out standards and

a few months, especially since the number of
contractors covered by the Labor Department’s rule
is only a small fraction of the number of employers
subject to the NLRA. In any event, the Board does
not believe that that is the proper criterion by
which to measure the rule’s effectiveness. The
purpose of requiring the posting of such notices is
to inform employees of their rights so that they may
exercise them more effectively, not to obtain any
particular result such as the filing of more election
petitions.

The same comment also cites a couple of
textbooks which it asserts are popularly used in
high schools today to argue that labor history is
being taught to today’s students. The Board is
unable to assess the truth of that assertion, but
regardless, it is unclear whether students
necessarily connect this history to their future
rights as employees.

°3Comment of Weinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld.

947d.

°5Comment of Staff Representative, Steelworkers.

°6 Accordingly, the Board finds it unnecessary to
conduct a study to determine the extent of
employees’ knowledge of NLRA rights. The Board
further observes that even if only 10 percent of
workers were unaware of those rights, that would
still mean that more than 10 million workers lacked
knowledge of one of their most basic workplace
rights. The Board believes that there is no question
that at least a similar percentage of employees are
unaware of the rights explained in the notice. In the
Board’s view, that justifies issuing the rule.

procedures related to allegations of
noncompliance and enforcement of the
tule. The discussion below is organized
in the same manner and explains the
Board’s reasoning in adopting the
standards and procedures contained in
the regulatory text, including the
Board’s responses to the comments
received.

Subpart A—Definitions, Requirements
for Employee Notice, and Exceptions
From Coverage Definitions

A. The Definitions

For the most part, the definitions
proposed in the rule are taken from
those appearing in Section 2 of the
NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 152. No comments
were received concerning those
definitions, and they are unchanged in
the final rule. A number of comments
were received concerning the definition
of other terms appearing in the rule.
Those comments are addressed below.

B. Requirements for Employee Notice

1. Content Requirements

The notice contains a summary of
employee rights established under the
NLRA. As explained above, the Board
believes that requiring notice of
employee rights is necessary to carry out
the provisions of the NLRA.
Accordingly, § 104.202 of the proposed
rule requires employers subject to the
NLRA to post and maintain the notice
in conspicuous places, including all
places where notices to employees are
customarily posted, and to take
reasonable steps to ensure that the
notices are not altered, defaced, or
covered by any other material, or
otherwise rendered unreadable.

As stated in the NPRM, the Board
considered the substantive content and
level of detail the notice should contain
regarding NLRA rights. In arriving at the
content of the notice of employee rights,
the Board proposed to adopt the
language of the Department of Labor’s
final rule requiring Federal contractors
to post notices of employees’ NLRA
rights. 29 CFR part 471. In the NPRM,
the Board explained that it tentatively
agreed with the Department of Labor
that neither quoting the statement of
employee rights contained in Section 7
of the NLRA nor briefly summarizing
those rights in the notice would be
likely to effectively inform employees of
their rights. Rather, the language of the
notice should include a more detailed
description of employee rights derived
from Board and court decisions
implementing those rights. The Board
also stated that it saw merit in the
Department of Labor’s judgment that
including in the notice examples, again

derived from Board and court decisions,
of conduct that violates the NLRA will
assist employees in understanding their
rights. 75 FR 80412.

Prior to issuing the NPRM, the Board
carefully reviewed the content of the
notice required under the Department of
Labor’s final rule, which was modified
in response to comments from
numerous sources, and tentatively
concluded that that notice explains
employee rights accurately and
effectively without going into excessive
or confusing detail. The Board therefore
found it unnecessary, for purposes of
the proposed rulemaking, to modify the
language of the notice in the Department
of Labor’s final rule. Moreover, the
Board reasoned that because the notice
of employee rights would be the same
under the Board’s proposed rule as
under the Department of Labor’s rule,
Federal contractors that have posted the
Department of Labor’s required notice
would have complied with the Board’s
rule and, so long as that notice is
posted, would not have to post a second
notice. Id.

The proposed notice contained
examples of general circumstances that
constitute violations of employee rights
under the NLRA. Thus, the Board
proposed a notice that provided
employees with more than a
rudimentary overview of their rights
under the NLRA, in a user-friendly
format, while simultaneously not
overwhelming employees with
information that is unnecessary and
distracting in the limited format of a
notice. As explained below, the Board
also tentatively agreed with the
Department of Labor that it is
unnecessary for the notice to include
specifically the right of employees who
are not union members and who are
covered by a contractual union-security
clause to refuse to pay union dues and
fees for any purpose other than
collective bargaining, contract
administration, or grievance adjustment.
See Communications Workers v. Beck,
487 U.S. 735 (1988). Id. at 80412-80413.

The Board specifically invited
comment on the statement of employee
rights proposed for inclusion in the
required notice to employees. In
particular, the Board requested
comment on whether the notice
contains sufficient information of
employee rights under the NLRA;
whether it effectively conveys that
information to employees; and whether
it achieves the desired balance between
providing an overview of employee
rights under the Act and limiting
unnecessary and distracting
information. Id. at 80413.

something which, in turn, is owed to its imperial superstructure. And
as that superstructure became too unwieldy, an emperor like the gruff
soldier Diocletian could allow for the division of the empire itself
into several administrative parts, thus furthering its life span.
America, for its part, is unique in its division of federal, state and
local power over a vast continental landscape, allowing for the full
expression of its boisterous democracy. Say what you will about the
deficiencies of the United States and particularly those of Rome, but
they both indicate a very difficult truth central to the outcome of the
Arab Spring: it is not about the expressions of freedom in Tahrir
Square so much as it is about the building of legitimate institutions to
replace illegitimate ones. And because institutions are hierarchical—
and social media like Twitterand Facebookdismantle existing
hierarchies—revolutions enabled by new technology do not
necessarily lead to the building of governing organizations. Criticism
is not enough, someone must wield power; hopefully in a way less
coercive than before.

Meanwhile, the Arab Spring has raised the pressure on autocrats the
world over to truly be good—or at least better. Though, even if they
are, they can never ultimately get it right, as demonstrated by Mill’s
example of Marcus Aurelius.

The final point that the LiButti case directs you to

consider is whether admitting the evidence will advance the
search for truth. And here we have a conspiracy, and I'm using

that term not as a lawyer but as a layperson for this purpose.

Webster's defines to conspire means to join together ina

secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act

which becomes unlawful as a result of a secret agreement. And
so we want to present the conspirator. Now we think that makes

the case that this is highly relevant and also appropriate for

an adverse inference. Again, your Honor could wait to rule on

this at trial, but we think it's clear-cut now.

Of course once you determine that something's

relevant, you then have to consider possible prejudicial

effect. Obviously this is a case in which sex allegations are
going to be at their heart. It's not like we have a business
dispute where somebody wants to throw in sex abuse. We want to

prove, in a case involving a sex conspiracy, what the

conspirators have to say. And there's no prejudice then to

Maxwell in the sense of unfair prejudice. He can ask whatever

questions they deem appropriate as well. But the absence of
the co-conspirators is of course highly prejudicial to

Ms. Giuffre. Naturally the jury is going to wonder, you said

Kellen was reporting to Maxwell. Where is Kellen? That's

going to be the first thing they'll say when they go back into

the jury room. Where are these people? And that's what

creation = growth + flow passed out - flow passed in, (3.3a)

since terms can change sides if they reverse signs.

Economics is interested in creation and growth of value. Value in the stock sense
means capital in general. Most economists most of the time use the word to mean
only the “physical capital” we buy and sell. But the truism works for anything. |
sometimes prefer the generality of “value”, meaning any amount of any mix of
human and physical capital. This again can be called either “total capital” or value

interchangeably.

Flow of value passed out is exhaust plus transfer out, and flow passed in is transfer
in. Creation of value is output in the net sense. Then (3.2) and (3.3a) give the total

return rule

output = growth + cash flow. (3.3b)

“Income” means rights to output, and is implicitly equal to output. Like most writers

in economics, I will use these words more or less interchangeably too.

Now comes the centerpiece. A good starting point is the present value rule. We
assemble value or total capital to satisfy foreseen tastes. But we also satisfy current
tastes by spending current cash flow. At the scale of the total capital (value) of the
individual, were reinvestment cancels internally, cash flow simplifies to exhaust in

taste satisfaction plus gift given less gift received. Then

individual cash flow = net gift + exhaust, (3.4)

where net gift means gift given less gift received.

Chief Michael Reiter, whom they describe as a born-again nut case.

According to the police investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Palm Beach
Post, detectives took statements from 17 witnesses and five alleged victims. Haley
Robson, 20, a Palm Beach Community College student who described herself as like a
Heidi Fleiss,” says she got naked to give Epstein a massage, then brought him six girls
ages 14-16 for massages and sex at his home. She said they were paid $200 per session.

Cops also allege that Epstein's personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been charged,
set up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied massage oils.
Police searched through Epstein's garbage and retrieved sex toys and feminine hygiene
products.

Epstein's Palm Beach lawyer, Jack Goldberger, told Page Six that the Florida state
attorney concluded the cops had looked at evidence from a one-sided perspective.” He
added that Epstein had passed an extensive lie-detector test in which he was grilled about
underage girls.

Epstein's New York lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, said, The prosecutor didn't want to bring
any charges in this case, but because of the craziness of this police chief, we have the
charge of solicitation.

Last night, WPTV in Palm Beach reported that one reason Robson's testimony may have
been dismissed is the kinky Web page she has on MySpace featuring photos of her
female friends playing with sex toys. One friend even uses the name Pimpin' Made EZ.
Robson, who isn't charged, also writes, Do what you do to make that money, life is

a gamble. Stay hustling.”

A spokeswoman for Reiter said, We think our investigation speaks for itself.

To legally get EB-5 investors to put money into his project, Matthews was required to
go through a regional center regulated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services

under the Department of Homeland Security.

So, he tapped Walsh — a South Florida resident who had a specious track record with
development projects — to raise the money through SARC. While it’s unclear how the
two met, Walsh allegedly lent Matthews more than $5 million of the foreign investors’

funds to keep his Palm Beach mansion from being foreclosed on.

(Click to enlarge)

In March 2014, Matthews sent Walsh an email to thank him for “saving [his] house,”

according to the SEC complaint.

As more developers turned to EB-5 for cheap financing after the financial crisis, more
regional centers received approval from the USCIS. From late 2014 to June 2019, the
number of regional centers in the U.S. jumped nearly 60 percent to 884, according to
USCIS. At the same time, close to 300 regional centers have been shuttered since
2007.

That high failure rate among EB-5 regional centers stems from an approval process

If only the Syrians could be brought around, presidents have believed
for generations, life would be so much easier. The United States
wasn't alone in this illusion -- the Israelis, Arabs, Europeans,

and Russians felt the same way. Like the Wall Street banks, Syria was
then, as it is now, judged as simply too big to fail. There was
something perversely comforting about having the Assads around.

I had my own fair share of illusions during my government career,
but the Assads were never one of them. I could never quite
understand my colleagues' fascination with the brutal Syrian regime.
To me, Bashar al-Assad was a brutal dictator who wanted to be the
Frank Sinatra of the Middle East -- obsessed with doing things his
own way to the point that he priced himself out of peace with Israel
and a relationship with the United States. It's striking that every other
Arab state, with the possible exception of Libya, managed to
establish a close relationship with the United States. Not Assad.
Third, Obama's approach toward Syria has been managed by the
realists. This stands in contrast with his Libya policy, where liberal
interventionists in the administration and neocons outside clamored
for action. This group of realists includes the president, who knows
his options on Syria aren't great. He's being told that American
leverage isn't great and that if he calls for Assad's head and the Syrian
despot survives, he'll have lost access to a key player in the region.
And after all, what could he do that would deter a regime in a fight
for its life? Pull U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford from Damascus?
Impose a travel ban on Assad and his family? Press the Europeans to
freeze Assad's money?

In a world of symbols, these steps may make an important point
about American values. However, none of them will make a
difference in how events play out in Syria.

Simply put, the Obama administration is worried about creating

a worse situation if Assad falls. Take your pick of scary scenarios:

Villafana emailed the defense stating that United States Attorney Acosta would accept no
less than 18 months of incarceration, following by a one-year term of house arrest.

Federal Prosecutors Misrepresented the Number of Alleged “Victims.”

17. In September 2007, in order to add additional pressure on Mr. Epstein to execute a
deferred prosecution agreement, AUSA Villafana claimed that there were “40” minors on
the government’s list of purported § 2255 victims. To compound that misleading
characterization, she continued to insist that a guardian-ad-litem be appointed to represent
these purported “minors” in the proceedings. See Tab 24, September 19, 2007 Email
from M. Villafana to J. Lefkowitz.

18. When challenged as to whether there was a genuine need for a guardian, given that Ms.
Villafana continued to refuse to disclose the names or any other information about her
putative list of “minors,” she eventually conceded that only “I is definitely under 18 still,
and I think there is another minor.” See Tab 25, September 23, 2007 Email from M.
Villafana to J. Lefkowitz (emphasis added).

19, The next day, AUSA Villafana retreated from the number “40,” stating that she had now
“compiled a list of 34 confirmed minor victims with no definition of how they would be
considered as such.. There are six others, whose names we already have, who need to be
interviewed by the FBI to confirm whether they were 17 or 18 at the time of their activity
with Mr. Epstein.” See Tab 26, September 24, 2007 Email from M. Villafana to J.
Lefkowitz (emphasis added). This statement indicated that, at least the “six others” (and,
as it turns out, all those identified except two) had reached the age of majority, and, in
fact, no guardian was necessary to represent their interests.

Defense Counsel was Falsely Advised That the Non Prosecution Agreement Would Be Kept
Confidential.

20. On September 24, Epstein and the USAO executed a Non Prosecution Agreement.

21. His attorneys asked Ms. Villafana to “please do whatever you can to keep this from
becoming public.” See Tab 27, September 24, 2007 Email from J. Lefkowitz to M.
Villafana.

22. Ms. Villafana replied that she had “forwarded your message only to Alex [Acosta], Andy
[Lourie], and Rolando [Garcia]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than that.” Jd.

23. Ms. Villafana stated that the agreement would be “placed in the case file, which will be
kept confidential since it also contains identifying information about the girls.” Jd.

The Prosecution Immediately Notifies Three Plaintiffs That Mr. Epstein Has Executed A
Non Prosecution Agreement

notified “three victims” of the “general terms” of the Non Prosecution Agreement. See

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031722.txt,"The Saudis are reliable defenders of the West’s diverse interests in the
region, and have been America’s principal ally in the Middle East for
more than seventy years. The confused notion that Saudi Arabia is
synonymous with radical Islam is falsely based on the Western notion
that “one size fits all.” Fundamentalists supporting the Islamic State in
the Kingdom violate the rule of law at home, and the Saudis’ strong
efforts to prevent the export of terrorism. Saudi senior leaders desire
good relations with the West and see the Islamic State and Jihadist
terrorism as threatening to their very rule. Through the safeguarding
of the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina, which remain open to tens of
millions of foreign visitors and differing Islamic beliefs, the Kingdom
has a unique window into the actions and motivations of radical
fundamentalists who pass in and out of those always accessible cities.
By sharing that intelligence, the Saudis greatly enhance America’s
security.

Like it or not, the military option most unpopular with America’s
voters and politicians may be its best. Bashar Assad may well be our
only hope in fighting the various terrorist factions that are attempting
to form an ISIS state. If America agrees that putting boots on the
ground would be impractical and ineffective, then a self-governed
“Syria State” must be the entity that reaches settlements with the
various factions that are causing the mass migration of thousands of
Syrians to Europe, the USA and elsewhere. The only solution is one
that works with Russia and not against them. Our vacuum forced that
hand, because we are no longer the lonesome superpower shaping
Middle East foreign policy.

When the USA had a narrow set of interests during the Cold War era,
acting prudently in favor of well-defined and communicated
objectives, its actions were more effective. But as the objectives
changed, and America attempted to democratize autocracies, the
broadening of goals led to a corresponding weakening of results. A
clear direction in the Middle East is imperative, not just to enhance
Middle Eastern nation-state interests, but to protect US interests at
home, as well as abroad.

chaotic equation so complex that the only way to see it is to run the
program and watch the output: no form of program analysis will give
you any clue as to what it produces. There is only one stipulation. The
answer to problem Y MUST be held within the program as a computable
algorithm. Put another way, the computer must already be ‘programmed’
to answer the question.

Could a human mathematician be pre-programmed from birth?
Yes, there is no fundamental objection to this. Mathematicians could be
born to solve the problems they solve. But this would present a couple of
issues. Where is this program stored? And who, or what, programmed
the mathematician? Could we perhaps find an experiment to determine
whether mathematicians are pre-programmed?

One view held by philosophers is that the Universe programmed
the mathematician. They believe we live in an entirely determined
Universe with no free will. There is then no mystery as to how Andrew
Wiles came up with his proof. He was destined to do it from the dawn of
time. The ink that fell from his pen to the paper was always going to fall
in just that way. We live in a clockwork Universe and although we might
feel we have free will, this is an illusion. I simply don’t believe this. If I
am right and humans do exercise free will, Andrew Wiles cannot be a
computer. And because Andrew is not alone in discovering proofs, those
mathematicians cannot be computers either. Humans are, therefore, not
computers.

The Chance Objection

I said there was no automatic way to solve any problem above the
logic limit, but this is not quite true. There is one automatic method
you could deploy to generate a non-computable proof, the infamous
‘monkeys and typewriters’ idea where we use random chance to generate
information. Many people have suggested it is possible to write a play
such as Shakespeare's Hamlet by simply typing random characters until
we happened upon the play. The argument is flawed.

The first flaw is the process would take a super-astronomically
long time. Even if every atom in the Universe were a monkey with a
typewriter, it would take orders of magnitude longer than the age of the
known Universe to come up with the script to a play or a mathematical
proof.

The probability of finding a solution to Fermat’s Last Theorem

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014482.txt,"Rotation trade — valuations have moved a long way

While technical metrics suggest a pause is due in the reflation rotation, we have also
seen a significant amount of ground covered from a valuation perspective in the market
moves to date.

The scatter chart below compares the PE relative change since 8th July (the post Brexit
valuation high / low for many sectors) against where PE relative ranks now compared to
history. Essentially sectors in the top right have enjoyed a relative multiple re-rating and
current relative PE levels are above the median since 1999. Those in the bottom left
have seen relative PE multiples de-rate while their current relative PE is below the
median since 1999. We make the following observations:

e Financials have had the biggest re-rating. Financials re-rated most since
Brexit and are now trading around median relative valuation levels. Given the
tight link between relative valuations and bond yields in recent years the PE-
relatives for Banks and Insurance have also recovered much more than would
seem justified by the move in the German 10-year yield. The sectors do screen
cheaper versus history on PBV reflecting relatively depressed ROEs especially
for Banks. Hence, we think PE multiple expansion from here would need to be
driven by improving EPS prospects in the sector — something our analysts are

sceptical about.

¢ Global Cyclicals trading near or below average relative PE’s. Many global
cyclicals have had fairly modest re-ratings since early July and trade on close to
median or below valuations. Sectors such as Industrials, Chemicals, Autos, Tech
have relative PE multiples 5-10% higher than post Brexit. Relative PE for
Chemicals and Industrials are close to post 1999 averages. Construction PE
relative does screen as elevated — at the 92? percentile. Autos, Tech and Travel
& Leisure all have PE relatives in the bottom quartile of their post 1999 range.
Relative PE valuations look very reasonable on this basis for Tech, Chemicals
and even industrials. In part this may reflect higher than historical average ROE
— relative PBV is less flattering for Industrials for example.

e Resources sectors — de-rating as EPS recovers. Oil and Basic Resources PE
relative has declined more than in any other sector. Although both sectors have
seen strong price performance this year, PE multiples are declining from very
elevated levels earlier this year as earnings bounce back from depressed levels.
Since the end of June Basics 12m forward EPS is up +65%, while the sector
index price has risen +33%. For Basics and Oil, performance from here is likely
to remain a function of EPS momentum rather than valuations.

e Defensives have all de-rated with Telecoms suffering least. Defensive
sectors have all seen relative valuations decline over the past four months.
Healthcare and Utilities are the two sectors with multiples at lower end of the
historical range — notably Healthcare at the 14 percentile. Utilities relative PE
is also close to the prior low hit in 2013. Telecoms screens as somewhat less
depressed form a valuation perspective — notwithstanding the poor sector
performance in 2016. PE relative remains well above the median levels since
1999.

e Staples approaching 2010/14 lows on PE-relative. Staples have also de-
rated severely — in fact Food & Beverage relative PE fell somewhat more than

Trump talked with bewilderment and resentment about strict quotas on European
immigration and the deluge from “Asia and other places.” (This deluge, as liberals would
be quick to fact-check, was, even as it had grown, still quite a modest stream.) His
obsessive focus on Obama’s birth certificate was in part about the scourge of non-
European foreignness—a certain race-baiting. Who were these people? Why were they
here?

The campaign sometimes shared a striking graphic. It showed a map of the country
reflecting dominant immigration trends in each state from fifty years ago—here was a
multitude of countries, many European. Today, the equivalent map showed that every state
in the United States was now dominated by Mexican immigration. This was the daily
reality of the American workingman, in Bannon’s view, the ever growing presence of an
alternative, discount workforce.

Bannon’s entire political career, such as it was, had been in political media. It was also
in Internet media—that is, media ruled by immediate response. The Breitbart formula was
to so appall the liberals that the base was doubly satisfied, generating clicks in a ricochet
of disgust and delight. You defined yourself by your enemy’s reaction. Conflict was the
media bait—hence, now, the political chum. The new politics was not the art of the
compromise but the art of conflict.

The real goal was to expose the hypocrisy of the liberal view. Somehow, despite laws,
rules, and customs, liberal globalists had pushed a myth of more or less open immigration.
It was a double liberal hypocrisy, because, sotto voce, the Obama administration had been
quite aggressive in deporting illegal aliens—except don’t tell the liberals that.

“People want their countries back,” said Bannon. “A simple thing.”

7 OK Ok

Bannon meant his EO to strip away the liberal conceits on an already illiberal process.
Rather than seeking to accomplish his goals with the least amount of upset—keeping
liberal fig leaves in place—he sought the most.

Why would you? was the logical question of anyone who saw the higher function of
government as avoiding conflict.

This included most people in office. The new appointees in place at the affected
agencies and departments, among them Homeland Security and State—General John
Kelly, then the director of Homeland Security, would carry a grudge about the disarray
caused by the immigration EO—wanted nothing more than a moment to get their footing
before they might even consider dramatic and contentious new policies. Old appointees—
Obama appointees who still occupied most executive branch jobs—found it unfathomable
that the new administration would go out of its way to take procedures that largely already
existed and to restate them in incendiary, red-flag, and ad hominem terms, such that

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016295.txt,"concept of “Pareto-topia”: the idea that AI, if done right, can bring about a future in
which everyone ’s lives are hugely improved, a future where there are no losers. A key
realization here is that what chiefly prevents humanity from achieving its full potential
might be our instinctive sense that we’re in a zero-sum game—a game in which players
are supposed to eke out small wins at the expense of others. Such an instinct 1s seriously
misguided and destructive in a “game” where everything is at stake and the payoff is
literally astronomical. There are many more star systems in our galaxy alone than there
are people on Earth.

Hope

As of this writing, I’m cautiously optimistic that the Al-risk message can save humanity
from extinction, just as the Soviet-occupation message ended up liberating hundreds of
millions of people. As of 2015, it had reached and converted 40 percent of AI
researchers. It wouldn’t surprise me if a new survey now would show that the majority
of AI researchers believe AI safety to be an important issue.

I’m delighted to see the first technical Al-safety papers coming out of DeepMind,
OpenAI, and Google Brain and the collaborative problem-solving spirit flourishing
between the Al-safety research teams in these otherwise very competitive organizations.

The world’s political and business elite are also slowly waking up: AI safety has
been covered in reports and presentations by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE), the World Economic Forum, and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD). Even the recent (July 2017) Chinese AI
manifesto contained dedicated sections on “AI safety supervision” and “Develop[ing]
laws, regulations, and ethical norms” and establishing “an AI security and evaluation
system” to, among other things, “[e]nhance the awareness of risk.” I very much hope that
a new generation of leaders who understand the AI Control Problem and AI as the
ultimate environmental risk can rise above the usual tribal, zero-sum games and steer
humanity past these dangerous waters we are in—thereby opening our way to the stars
that have been waiting for us for billions of years.

Here’s to our next hundred thousand years! And don’t hesitate to speak the truth,
even if your voice trembles.

Women Empowerment: Women to Women Talks



Our mission is to support and enhance women’s professional and personal growth and fulfillment. 

We are deeply committed to providing achievement-driven women with inspiration, guidance, and elevating networking opportunities networking. 








We organize and conduct seminars with female speakers who are leaders in their industry.
Our seminal approach can me likened to “TED Talks for Women.” The speaker shares the secrets of her professional and personal success with the audience and answers the questions. The discussions will include, but won’t be limited to the following topics: How to pursue a career of your dream? What makes you feel empowered? How to build one of a kind brand? How to achieve both self-realization in professional life and fulfillment personal life? 



Our first seminar is going to take place in NYC on April 5th. Consequently, we will be conducting one seminar every month.



Kathy Ruemmler is going to be the first speaker.




Kathy is an attorney who formerly served as White House Counsel to President Barack Obama. She previously worked as Principal Deputy White House Counsel. 
Kathryn Ruemmler is global co-chair of the white-collar defense and investigations practice at Latham & Watkins. She rejoined the firm after five years in the Obama administration, first in the Department of Justice and then as President Obama's chief lawyer, when she headed a team of around 45 lawyers and staff in the White House Counsel's office. Obama has said she has “an uncanny ability to see around the corners that no one else anticipates.” Earlier in her career, Ruemmler was a federal prosecutor who helped secure the convictions of former Enron executives Kenneth Lay and Jeff Skilling.

If resellers (or distributors) still send you checks—the fulfillment house should handle customer
checks at this point—do one of three things: give the resellers direct bank deposit information (ideal),
have the fulfillment house handle these checks (second choice), or have the resellers pay via PayPal or
mail checks to one of the people you are trusting with power of attorney (far third). In the last case, give
the person with power of attorney deposit slips so he or she can sign or stamp and mail in the checks. It
is convenient to become a member of a large bank (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual,
Citibank, etc.) with branches near the person assisting you so that they can drop off the deposits while
running other errands. No need to move all accounts to this bank if you don’t want to; just open a single
new account that is used solely for these deposits.

If you are an entrepreneur, downgrade your cell phone to the cheapest plan and set up a voicemail
greeting that states, “I am currently overseas on business. Please do not leave a voicemail, as I will not
be checking it while gone. Please send me an e-mail at__ @__.com if the matter is important. Thank you
for your understanding.” Then set up e-mail autoresponders that indicate responses could take up to
seven days (or whatever you decide for frequency) due to international business travel.

If you are an employee, consider getting a quad-band or GSM-compatible cell phone so that the boss
can contact you. Get a BlackBerry only if your boss will be checking to see if you are working via e-
mail. Be sure to disable the dead giveaway “Sent from a BlackBerry” signature on outgoing e-mail!
Other options include using a Skypeln account that forwards to your foreign cell phone (my preference)

Find an apartment for your ultimate mini-retirement destination or reserve a hostel or hotel at your
starting point for three to four days. Reserving an apartment before you arrive is riskier and will be much
more expensive than using the latter three to four days to find an apartment. I recommend hostels for the
starting point if possible—not for cost considerations but because the staff and fellow travelers are more
knowledgeable and helpful with relocations.

But if Halberstam defined the presidential mien, Trump defied 1t—and defiled it. Not a
single attribute would place him credibly in the revered circle of American presidential
character and power. Which was, in a curious reversal of the book’s premise, just what
created Steve Bannon’s opportunity.

The less likely a presidential candidate is, the more unlikely, and, often, inexperienced,
his aides are—that is, an unlikely candidate can attract only unlikely aides, as the likely
ones go to the more likely candidates. When an unlikely candidate wins—and as outsiders
become ever more the quadrennial flavor of the month, the more likely an unlikely
candidate is to get elected—ever more peculiar people fill the White House. Of course, a
point about the Halberstam book and about the Trump campaign was that the most
obvious players make grievous mistakes, too. Hence, in the Trump narrative, unlikely
players far outside the establishment hold the true gentus.

Still, few have been more unlikely than Steve Bannon.

At sixty-three, Bannon took his first formal job in politics when he joined the Trump
campaign. Chief Strategist—his title in the new administration—was his first job not just
in the federal government but in the public sector. (“Szrategist!” scoffed Roger Stone,
who, before Bannon, had been one of Trump’s chief strategists.) Other than Trump
himself, Bannon was certainly the oldest inexperienced person ever to work in the White
House.

It was a flaky career that got him here.

Catholic school in Richmond, Virginia. Then a local college, Virginia Tech. Then seven
years in the Navy, a lieutenant on ship duty and then in the Pentagon. While on active
duty, he got a master’s degree at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service, but then he
washed out of his naval career. Then an MBA from Harvard Business School. Then four
years as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs—his final two years focusing on the
media industry in Los Angeles—but not rising above a midlevel position.

In 1990, at the age of thirty-seven, Bannon entered peripatetic entre-preneurhood under
the auspices of Bannon & Co., a financial advisory firm to the entertainment industry. This
was something of a hustler’s shell company, hanging out a shingle in an industry with a
small center of success and concentric rings radiating out of rising, aspiring, falling, and
failing strivers. Bannon & Co., skirting falling and failing, made it to aspiring by raising
small amounts of money for independent film projects—none a hit.

Bannon was rather a movie figure himself. A type. Alcohol. Bad marriages. Cash-
strapped in a business where the measure of success is excesses of riches. Ever scheming.
Ever disappointed.

For a man with a strong sense of his own destiny, he tended to be hardly noticed. Jon

versatility of neurons and their synapses. This could become a new, great frontier of
research. Here too, biology might point the way, as we come to understand biological
development well enough to imitate its essence.

Altogether, the advantages of artificial over natural intelligence appear
permanent, while the advantages of natural over artificial intelligence, though substantial
at present, appear transient. I’d guess that it will be many decades before engineering
catches up, but—barring catastrophic wars, climate change, or plagues, so that
technological progress stays vigorous—few centuries.

If that’s right, we can look forward to several generations during which humans,
empowered and augmented by smart devices, coexist with increasingly capable
autonomous Als. There will be a complex, rapidly changing ecology of intelligence, and
rapid evolution in consequence. Given the intrinsic advantages that engineered devices
will eventually offer, the vanguard of that evolution will be cyborgs and superminds,
rather than lightly adorned Homo sapiens.

Another important impetus will come from the exploration of hostile
environments, both on Earth (e.g., the deep ocean) and, especially, in space. The human
body is poorly adapted to conditions outside a narrow band of temperatures, pressures,
and atmospheric composition. It needs a wide variety of specific, complex nutrients, and
plenty of water. Also, it is not radiation-hardened. As the manned space program has
amply demonstrated, it is difficult and expensive to maintain humans outside their
terrestrial comfort zone. Cyborgs or autonomous AIs could be much more effective in
these explorations. Quantum Als, with their sensitivity to noise, might even be happier in
the cold and dark of deep space.

In a moving passage from his 1935 novel Odd John, science fiction’s singular
genius Olaf Stapledon has his hero, a superhuman (mutant) intelligence, describe Homo
sapiens as “the Archaeopteryx of the spirit.” He says this, fondly, to his friend and
biographer, who is a normal human. Archaeopteryx was a noble creature, and a bridge to
greater ones.

write out the symbols in a table and assign a musical note to each. It is
straightforward to put these notes into a synthesizer and play the piece
of music. I have provided a link to such a piece. Warning: once you listen
to this you will have been ‘creatively inoculated’

This resulting piece of music, based on the transliteration of a proof,
is non-computable. You might immediately argue with this, “The piece
of music was translated from proof text to music file using a computer. It
is clearly computed. but this is not my point. The music could not have
come into existence in our Universe as a result of a computation. It is a
computable translation of a non-computable string. It could not have
been generated solely by a computer: It was done in two steps, the first of
which could not have been computed.

If, up to this time, our Universe has never contained a piece of
music that was generated non-computationally, it does now. If you listen
to this piece, you will find it impossible not to be somewhat inspired by
it. You cannot erase the experience from your memory. And once you
have heard it you will have been creatively inoculated. I have defeated
Daniel Dennett and his like, and given you creative freedom!

www.jamestagg.com/noncompmusic

Having made at least some music above the Turing limit I could
declare victory but I want to go further. Using the same reduction method,
I believe we can show all art is above the limit. First let’s attempt novels
and plays. Do you enjoy those crime novels by Agatha Christie and Colin
Dexter? It must be possible to construct a plot sufficiently complex, and
a murder sufficiently baffling that it exceeds the logic limit. I could keep
extending this idea to provide any number of examples and, therefore,
prove all art and creative output is above the logic limit.

There are many other arts we could apply this argument too. In
the visual domain there are non-computable images. In principle, it is
possible, to draw or paint things beyond the capability of a computer.
Roger Penrose has created non-computable visual puzzles such as tiling
an infinite plain with special jigsaw pieces. Creating an image containing
a solution to his visual puzzle is non-computable.

This extension argument also applies to me. There is an argument
that I am a finite being and therefore can be simulated by a computer.
Since I can be simulated by a computer, I am the same as a computer
and therefore incapable of non-computable thought. The argument is as
follows: James Tagg will have during his life a finite number of inputs and,
equally, a finite set of outputs. This means you could model me using a

Important Disclosures

FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).

Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*
Buy = 10% < 10%
Neutral 20% = 30%
Underperform NIA = 20%

*Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.

INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays
no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s
coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.

BofA Merrill Lynch Research Personnel (including the analyst(s) responsible for this report) receive compensation based upon, among other factors, the overall profitability of Bank of America

Einstein’s Brain

of the brain. Whether this is related to his highly creative thinking or just
random chance is unknown, but it’s an interesting data point in our quest
to understand creativity and intelligence.

Looking through a microscope, the wrinkly grey matter is composed
of 30 trillion neurons; small whitish cells sprouting filaments that wrap
around each other like the tentacles of an octopus. The tentacles, and
there can be as many as 10,000 per cell, are known as dendrites and spread
out to nearly touch other neurons. At the other end of the neuron is a
single axon. The gaps between the end of an axon and the next neuron’s
dendrites are called synapses, about one-tenth of the width of a human
hair and varied in structure. When a nerve ‘fires, an electrical pulse
spreads out along the axon to the end and crosses the synapses to other
brain cells. This electrical pulse is not like the flow of current in a wire:
neurons don't conduct electricity. It is more akin to dominoes falling in
a line. Ion gates in the walls of the neuron open, letting potassium ions
flow out. As the gates open in one section, the next section is triggered
and so on. Thus, electrical signals ripple out along the axon. As the
electrical signals cross the synapses they either excite or inhibit the firing
of adjacent neurons. There is a lot more structure to a neuron than was
once thought. The textbook model is of a sequence of ion sacks stacked
end to end rather like plant cells, but neurons have a far more complex
structure. Bundles of actin and tubulin form a skeleton in the neuron and
the neuron metabolizes ATP to recharge its firing mechanism. Neurons
behave far more like small animals than inanimate plant cells.

placing a sacred institution entirely in the hands of the church while placing a secular institution
under state control. Roger Williams and Thomas Jefferson would surely have approved.

Although this proposal may sound radical, it does not differ fundamentally -- except for labels --
from the situation that exists in many states today. Throughout the United States, couples have
the option of being married civilly by going to town halls or to a justice of the peace and simply
signing a marriage certificate. They also have the option of going to a church, synagogue or
mosque and being married in a religious ceremony. So most Americans already have the choice
between a sacrament and a secular agreement ratified by the state.

All that would be different would be the name we give the secular agreement. The word
marriage would be reserved for those who chose the religious sacrament.

Though some traditionalists would be certain to balk at an explicit division between marriage and
civil union, a majority of Americans already agree that gay couples should be allowed to join in
secular unions with the rights and responsibilities that generally accompany marriage.

I concluded my op ed as follows:

So let each couple decide whether they want to receive the sacrament of marriage or the
secular status of civil union. And let the state get out of the business of determining who
should receive holy sacraments.

My column was widely circulated and generated an enormous debate. I was invited to appear on
television and radio shows, where extremists on both sides pilloried me: gay activists for not
going far enough; religious anti-gay activists for going too far.

Shortly after my column appeared, I received a phone call from the then Governor of
Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, who told me that he found my idea interesting and asked me to
draft legislation that he might consider proposing in order to break the deadlock. I drafted the
legislation, but never heard back from the governor, who by the time I submitted it, had
announced his candidacy for President of the United States. He was almost certainly fearful of
the pushback he would get from the religious right—whose votes he needed to be nominated—if
he were seen as favoring anything that even resembled gay marriage.

Since that time, several states have adopted gay marriage or civil unions and the trend is clearly in
the direction of full equality for gay men and women. I predict, based on the reaction of my
current students to this issue, that the next generation will not even understand why earlier
generations took so long to recognize equality for gays.

A woman’s right to choose abortion

As easy as the resolution of the gay marriage issue would be under our Constitution—full equality
either in marriage or civil unions for all—that’s how difficult it is to resolve the abortion issue as a

Most important, however, is that the extraordinary nature of this misconduct, so unusual
in ordinary federal prosecutions, raises the gravest of concerns about why prosecutors would go
to such lengths in a case already being prosecuted by the State and with so little, if any, federal
concern. Accordingly, we ask you to conduct your own investigation of these matters, because
we believe that what we have provided you may constitute only the tip of a very deep iceberg.
Without the power of subpoena, which we currently lack, we are unable to dig deeper. We
strongly believe that there is far more exculpatory evidence that has not been disclosed, more
leaks that we have not yet uncovered and more questionable behavior. This is a case that cries
out for a deeper investigation than we are capable of conducting, before any decision to
prosecute is permitted.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016939.txt,"Development of human-AI ecosystems is perhaps inevitable for a social species
such as ourselves. We became social early in our evolution, millions of years ago. We
began exchanging information with one another to stay alive, to increase our fitness. We
developed writing to share abstract and complex ideas, and most recently we’ve
developed computers to enhance our communication abilities. Now we’re developing AI
and machine-learning models of ecosystems and sharing the predictions of those models
to jointly shape our world through new laws and international agreements.

We live in an unprecedented historic moment, in which the availability of vast
amounts of human behavioral data and advances in machine learning enable us to tackle
complex social problems through algorithmic decision making. The opportunities for
such a human-AI ecology to have positive social impact through fairer and more
transparent decisions are obvious. But there are also risks of a “tyranny of algorithms,”
where unelected data experts are running the world. The choices we make now are
perhaps even more momentous than those we faced in the 1950s, when AI and
cybernetics were created. The issues look similar, but they’re not. We have moved down
the road, and now the scope is larger. It’s not just AI robots versus individuals. It’s AI
guiding entire ecologies.

How can we make a good human-artificial ecosystem, something that’s not a machine
society but a cyberculture in which we can all live as homans—a culture with a human
feel to it? We don’t want to think small—for example, to talk only of robots and self-
driving cars. We want this to be a global ecology. Think Skynet-size. But how would
you make Skynet something that’s about the human fabric?

The first thing to ask is: What’s the magic that makes the current AI work?
Where is it wrong and where 1s it right?

The good magic is that it has something called the credit-assignment function.
What that lets you do is take “stupid neurons’”—little linear functions—and figure out, in
a big network, which ones are doing the work and strengthen them. It’s a way of taking a
random bunch of switches all hooked together in a network and making them smart by
giving them feedback about what works and what doesn’t. This sounds simple, but
there’s some complicated math around it. That’s the magic that makes current AI work.

The bad part of it is, because those little neurons are stupid, the things they learn
don’t generalize very well. If an AI sees something it hasn’t seen before, or if the world
changes a little bit, the AI is likely to make a horrible mistake. It has absolutely no sense
of context. In some ways, it’s as far from Norbert Wiener’s original notion of
cybernetics as you can get, because it isn’t contextualized; it’s a little idiot savant.

But imagine that you took away those limitations: Imagine that instead of using
dumb neurons, you used neurons in which real-world knowledge was embedded. Maybe
instead of linear neurons, you used neurons that were functions in physics, and then you
tried to fit physics data. Or maybe you put in a lot of knowledge about humans and how
they interact with one another—the statistics and characteristics of humans.

When you add this background knowledge and surround it with a good credit-
assignment function, then you can take observational data and use the credit-assignment
function to reinforce the functions that are producing good answers. The result is an AI
that works extremely well and can generalize. For instance, in solving physical

FOR IMPROVING FOIA

FOIA also directs OGIS to make recommendations to Congress and the

President to improve FOIA. In April 2012, OGIS released five recommendations

that the Office compiled in its first years. For example, OGIS encouraged agency
participation in FOIAonline, the Federal Government’s first multiagency FOIA

portal. As a founding partner in FOIAonline, OGIS continues to support the
portal’s improvement of services and expansion of partners.

In March 2013, OGIS issued four additional recommendations for

improving FOIA.

1. IMPLEMENTING DISPUTE
RESOLUTION FOR FOIA CONFLICTS

OGIS expanded its dispute resolution program to connect FOIA professionals,
legal counsel, and dispute resolution professionals to embed dispute resolution
firmly into an agency’s FOIA process. The goal is to identify issues that are
ripe for partnership and explore ways to work together to prevent and resolve
disputes as well as avoid litigation.

In 2013, OGIS identified several agencies, including OGIS’s parent agency,
NARA, to help to pilot a project designed to prevent and resolve disputes as
well as avoid litigation. OGIS has begun meeting with each of these agencies
to determine the types of FOIA disputes that result in litigation and to explore
ways to incorporate dispute resolution into their FOIA processes. (OGIS

also has worked with the Administrative Conference of the United States

to promote research into FOIA litigation to inform this process.) OGIS will

continue to pilot this project in FY 2014.

Arafat viewed me, as he had Rabin before me, as a “fellow fighter”. But if so, I
now wondered whether that might have been part of the problem in his ever
truly understanding my mission at Camp David. My motivations. Or my mind.

Even in Israel, my reputation as a soldier has sometimes been as much a
burden as an advantage. A whole body of stories has followed me from my 36
years in uniform — a career which, after Saveret Matkal, led me up the military
ladder until I was head of operations, intelligence, and eventually of the entire
army as Chief of Staff. By the time I left the military, I was the single most
decorated soldier in our country’s history. Some of the stories were actually
true: that when we burst onto the hijacked Sabena airliner, for instance, we were
dressed as a maintenance crew; or that, in leading an assassination raid in Beirut
against the PLO group that had murdered Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich
Olympics, I was disguised as a woman. Not the most attractive young lady,
perhaps, though I did, painfully, pluck my eyelashes, and, with the help of four
pairs of standard-issue Israeli Army socks, develop quite a comely bosom. I
rejected the idea of wearing a long dress, in favour of stylishly flared trousers. I
was going on a commando operation, after all, not a prom date. But I did wear
heels. So yes, a woman, of sorts.

Yet some of the stories were just plain myth. I had given up counting the
times I’d heard about my alleged prowess in recording the fastest-ever time on
the most gruelling of the Israeli army’s obstacle courses. In fact, I was a lot
more like Goldie Hawn in Private Benjamin.

The main misunderstanding, however, went deeper. The assumption
appeared to be that my military achievements, especially in Sayeret Matkal,
were down to a mix of brute force and raw courage. Courage, of course, was a
requirement: the willingness to take risks, if the rewards for success, or the costs
of inaction, were great enough. Few of the operations I fought in or commanded
were without the real danger of not coming back alive. But whatever success I'd
had as a soldier, particularly in Matkal, was not only, nor even mainly, about
biceps. It was about brains. The ability to make decisions. To withstand the
pressure of often having to make the most crucial decisions within a matter of
seconds. It was, above all, about thinking and analyzing — and always, always,
looking and planning ahead.

And as our plane droned onward towards Israel, I knew that I would now
need all of those qualities more than ever.

The Tony Awards

Roger Cohen

May 12, 2011— Every few years along comes a brilliant Jewish
writer called Tony with challenging views on Israel, and this great
city — on all other matters the most open in the world — gets tied in
knots over what can or cannot be said. After “L’ Affaire Judt” we
have “L’ Affaire Kushner,” but with different outcomes that suggest a
shifting American Jewish discourse.

The late Tony Judt, author of the brilliant study of late 20th-century
Europe called “Postwar,” saw his New York persona changed with
the appearance in 2003 in The New York Review of Books of an
article called “Israel: The Alternative.” It posited the creation of a
single binational state of Jews and Palestinians and suggested a
Jewish state was anachronistic.

The calls to his office began — “Tell Tony Judt this is Hitler calling
and he says, “Congratulations.”’ Years later, an event featuring Judt
at the Polish Consulate got canceled at the last minute after its
organizers apparently came under pressure from prominent New
York Jewish groups.

To this day, in the city this British-born Jew came to love for its
clamorous diversity, Judt’s luminous oeuvre sometimes seems
overshadowed by a single polemical piece.

I disagreed with Judt: No alternative binational state of Palestinians
and Jews is imaginable in the Holy Land, at least not this side of
utopia. History demonstrates that Jews need a homeland called Israel.
Amos Oz, the Israeli author, has noted that, “When my father was a
young man in Vilna, every wall in Europe said, ‘Jews go home to
Palestine.’ Fifty years later when he went back to Europe on a visit,

ever, according to a reply by a CIA public affairs officer to the Times,
Snowden had not been fired or accused of attempting to “break into
classified computer files to which he did not have authorized access.”

A former CIA officer who had also been at the U.S. mission
in Geneva explained the discrepancy to me. He said that the spin
the CIA put on the story was “necessary containment.” After the
Snowden breach occurred in June 2013, the CIA had a problem that
could, as he put it, “blow up in its face.” If Snowden had been fired
but allowed to keep his security clearance in 2009, the CIA’s incom-
petence could be partly blamed for the NSA’s subsequent employ-
ment of him. If he had broken into a computer to which he was not
authorized, he should have been fired if not arrested.

What this spin glossed over, according to this former CIA officer,
is the part about Snowden’s behavior that concerned his superior.
Technically, Snowden, as a CIA communications officer, was autho-
rized to use the computer system. The problem was that Snowden
had deliberately misused it by adding code to it. This code could have
compromised the security of the CIA's “live system.” So while what

© the CIA public affairs officer quoted in the Times story said was cor- ®
rect, it clouded the issue.

During his time in Geneva, Snowden had received no promotions
or commendations for his work. He was threatened with a punitive
investigation unless he agreed to quietly resign from the CIA. “It
was not a stellar career” Drumheller, the former CIA station chief,
told me in 2014.

Snowden blamed his career-ending “derog” on an “e-mail spat”
with a superior. From Moscow, he wrote to James Risen of the Times
that his superior officer ordered him not “to rock the boat.” Further,
he complained that the technical team at the CIA station in Geneva
had “brushed him off,” even though he had a legitimate grievance.
When he complained about a flaw in the computer system, he said
that his superior took vengeance on him. He said he added the code
to the system to prove he was right. He attributed the “derog” in
his file to the incompetence, blindness, and errors of his superiors.
According to Snowden, he was a victim. This would not be the last
time he faulted superiors for their supposed incompetence. He would

House prices have already fallen by 32 percent nationwide from the 2006 peak. And they have further to go. The latest readings on
the S&P/Case-Schiller home price index, one prominent measure, showed another record decline in May. At some point, the declines
will moderate and stop being records. But prices need to stop falling altogether, and probably rise, for a real recovery to happen. The
Federal Reserve thinks home prices could stop falling in 2010, after a total decline of 41 to 48 percent. Other metrics, like housing
starts and new-home sales, might point upward before then. Those will be signs of signs of a turnaround, not the real thing.

Household wealth increases. The housing bust and the volatile stock market have hammered the traditional investment tools that
most Americans use, causing epic declines in the wealth of Americans. Since 2006, household net worth has declined by about $12
trillion, which equates to about $107,000 of lost wealth for each of America's 112 million households. That's partly because of the 40
percent plunge in the stock market since October 2007 and partly because of the steep declines in real estate values.

Americans simply own less, too. Home equity for the typical homeowner is just 41.1 percent, a record low. In 2002, it was 58.4
percent. Owning less means we owe more and will have to rebuild savings before we can spend like we used to. This will be a drag
on all discretionary purchases, says Dirk van Dyk, an analyst at Zacks Investment Research who thinks the tightfistedness will cut
into the earnings of firms ranging from hotel chains to furniture makers to motorcycle manufacturers. Those are the same kinds of
companies that need to start hiring again for a real recovery to develop. But they won't if sales stay sluggish. A turnaround will
require sustained stock market gains and an end to the housing bust.

President Obama stops fudging on the economy. There's still a lot that could go wrong, and Obama knows it. Yet part of the
president's job is to reassure skittish Americans, even as his economic lieutenants are fighting battles in the war room. That's why
Obama has been making half-hearted pronouncements, like saying that the economy shows some return to normalcy and that we
expect there'll be some stabilization of the economy. Virtually all of Obama's remarks on the economy contain modifiers and future
tense and a not-quite-there-yet quality, since he'll blow his own credibility if he tries to convince Americans that they're better off
than they actually are. When Obama starts hedging less, be happy. That will signal better days. Finally.

The IMF does offer a bit of more heartening news: The global wipe out finally seems to be receding. The world economy is
stabilizing,” the IMF reports. Its global economic growth projection of 2.5 percent in 2010 is 0.6 points higher than predicted in
April. But the global economy isn't expected to gain its footing in earnest until the second half of 2010. Maybe by then American
spenders will have come out of hiding.

Obama says stimulus plan to kick in later this year Reuters
Obama says stimulus plan to kick in later this year
By Tom Doggett — Sat Jul 11, 3:13 pm ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) — President Barack Obama said Saturday more time was needed for his $787 billion stimulus package to
work, predicting the spending would have a bigger impact on the economy later this year.

In an advanced text of his weekly radio speech, Obama said the stimulus plan approved by Congress and signed into law in mid-

February was not designed to work in four months -- it was designed to work over two years.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said it was too soon to decide whether the U.S. economy needed the help of a second-
round of government stimulus to recover from recession.

I don't think that's a judgment we need to make now, can't really make it now prudently, responsibly, he said in a taped interview
with CNN that will air Sunday.

According to a transcript provided by CNN, Geithner said the biggest thrust of the stimulus package signed into law earlier this
year would take effect in the second half of the year.

Obama's comments follow government data showing the unemployment rate soared to 9.5 percent in June, the highest level since
1983 and above the 8 percent peak predicted by the White House when it worked with Congress to pass the package. Republicans
say the stimulus plan is not working.

Obama now warns unemployment likely will top 10 percent in the coming months.

We must let (the stimulus plan) work the way it's supposed to, with the understanding that in any recession, unemployment tends to
recover more slowly than other measures of economic activity, Obama said.

He said the benefits of the plan would accelerate greatly throughout the summer and the fall.

deal with a major conflict with the Syrians. All of this, under a tight seal of
secrecy.

Finally, in early September 2007, everything was in place. Olmert briefed the
cabinet, and secured the ministers’ approval to destroy the reactor, with the
understanding that the precise timing of the operation would now be left to the
Prime Minister, the Defense Minister and the Foreign Minister: Olmert, me and
Tzipi Livni. The three of us met immediately after the cabinet discussion. Olmert
argued that the risk of leaks justified attacking that night, and I agreed with him.
Tzipi was reluctant, but Olmert turned to her and said: “Are you sure you’re
comfortable with an attack being ordered by me and Barak, while you chose to
abstain?” She thought it over, and added her approval.

We struck just after midnight, in an intricately coordinated air attack that
evaded not only a Syrian response, but Syrian notice. The reactor was destroyed.
Although even today the exact details remain subject to Israel’s military secrecy
regulations, accounts published abroad in the weeks and months that followed
painted a surprisingly accurate picture, including the pioneering use of electronic
warfare capabilities to deal with risk of radar detection. But in the immediate
aftermath of the attack, Israel deliberately made no public comment. We refused to
say whether we’d had anything to do with an attack. As we he had hoped, this
allowed the Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, both the space and a good reason to
deny that it had ever happened, deny that he’d been trying to make a nuclear
weapon, and thus feel no compelling reason to retaliate.

The reactor operation, however, marked the start of an increasingly tough
period in both my and Tzipi’s relationship with Olmert. Policy was not the
problem. There were no major security crises in the months ahead. But in the
spring of 2008, it became known that the Israeli police were investigating Olmert’s
relationship with an American businessman named Moshe Talansky. The
suggestion, initially in a New York paper and then the Israeli press, was that
Olmert was guilty of taking bribes. In his first public response, he didn’t deny

The dining hall around us was dark as Nan finished his discussion that night. At our
table we sat in a pool of dim light and waited on the Master as he considered his
next thoughts. I knew that some of what drew China’s great minds here to dinners
with him was a sense that those old ideas of Chinese philosophy - born in an age of
chaos and dating back to a time before rational calculation and scientific progress -
offered hope. I asked Master Nan where he would begin on a quest to understand
this age and how best to prepare. How to cultivate oneself?

“You know you can’t just understand this easily,” Master Nan said sharply. He was a
little angry with me, I could see, for asking such a direct question - and he was also
using the Chinese teaching technique of taking students through a range of emotions
to accelerate their learning. Chinese philosophers believe we learn differently
depending on how we feel, so a teacher making a student scared or insulted or
proud is often just an educational tactic. Nan was working on my humiliation bone
now: “This isn’t like some idea I can sell you and then you can just go and use,” he
continued, his voice rising. “This is going to be hard.”

Master Nan inhaled on his cigarette and waited a moment. “If you work, though,
maybe you can be like Su Qin,” he said, “the man who wrestled 20 years of peace out
of 300 years of war.” Su Qin was the hero of the Warring States period during which
China collapsed into total chaos. He is remembered today, two thousand years later,
for the way he had penetrated the madness of his age and how he found there
deeper fibers of truth that he lashed into a stable peace. “Su Qin started as an
idealist. He failed.

“You know, Su Qin was humiliated in trying to advise kings. Even his kin were
embarrassed. His sister and mother refused to let him return to the family home. He
was in so much pain over this embarrassment that he sat in front of a desk and read
every book of history he could find for seven years. He tied his long hair to a beam
above his desk so that if he fell asleep it would hold his head up. Sometimes he
would stab a knife into his thigh to keep awake.” Nan’s voice was rising, his speech
picking up pace. “But in the end, he learned. Su Qin learned. You should study him. If
you do this, if you are sincere, if you work hard, if you learn these ideas, you can
understand. Can you be that disciplined?” The room was dead quiet now. No one
looked at me. In the silence, one of the guests passed around a plate of cut fresh fruit
and cherries and sweet dried dates.

Nan’s relentless, intense Ch’an Buddhism sort of enlightenment, delivered only after
painful years of carbon-crushing intellectual intensity, expressed a clear ambition:
To learn to feel through invisible relations and balances and to construct something
promising and hopeful on the other side. Nan’s long sessions of mediation or sword
play, his furious pursuing philosophical dialogues that reduced students to an
embarrassed sweating state, these were all aimed at sharpening a blade so as to
instantly carve at the energy flows of our age. Did “spiritual illness” really linger
ahead of us? What sort of tragedy did that suggest? What was it that, hair tied to the

better able to articulate and defend nuanced positions. The same is true of liberals and everyone
else. I always play the devil’s advocate, challenging every view, questioning every idea, pushing
every opinion.

In doing so, I learn a great deal from my students. My classroom is truly a marketplace of ideas.
This should not be surprising, considering my life-long commitment to freedom of expression and
the widest exchange of views, as I describe in the next chapter.

When I was offered the job at Harvard at age 24, I knew that I was qualified to teach theoretical
subjects, but I worried about my lack of real world legal experience, since I had never practiced
law. (One summer at a law firm between my second and third year at Yale does not a practitioner
make.) Unlike some academics, my Brooklyn upbringing gave me a practical bent of mind—
“street smarts”—but I craved some real world experience. I looked for opportunities to become
involved in cases that would provide a smooth transition from theory to practice. Within a few
years of beginning my teaching career, I found a natural transition in the form of First Amendment
cases challenging governmental censorship.

a couple of weeks, maybe a week, I had quit Mar-a-Lago and I was working for Jeffrey
full time.

JS: Ok, let’s talk about your job at Mar-a-Lago, if we could. You said that your Dad was
working there. What was his position at Mar-a-~-Lago?

V: He was a maintenance supervisor I think is what it was called? He like managed the
tennis courts and air conditioners and things like that.

JS: | What is your Dad’s full name?

V: Sky William Roberts.

JS: — And is he still living here in South Florida now?
V: No, he’s not, he’s in California.

JS: Ok. Is your Dad aware of what is currently going on with regard to your having made
public statements about your relationship with Jeffrey?

V: Yes, he is well aware of it. I told my family even before all this stuff came out, because
they were the first ones contacted by the journalists from Mail on Sunday. I know that
they the Mail on Sunday printed that I had gone out and tried to, I mean I think one of the
photos said that I was angry that I saw Jeffrey and the Prince walking together and that is
why I came out and went public with everything. Not true. I mean, I am angry about
how they are still up to their old ways together and that they’re still hanging out but I
didn’t contact the Mail on Sunday and I didn’t bring it out. I figured that everyone was
going to bring it out anyway and I better bring it out the right way. He’s known
everything from the start, and my family is very supportive with everything going on.

JS: I’mkind of going to jump around a little bit and I apologize for that, but since the subject
has come up, tell me first of all why you are providing this cooperation to us, and I am
certainly very appreciative of it, but I want you to tell us why it is you’ve chosen to spend
time with us on the telephone and provide this information that you’re now providing.

V: I’m out to help the bigger picture, you know, I think all of us can make a big difference in
a lot of other people’s lives and I think that this has gone on long enough and it’s a big
slap in my face that he can get away with hurting me so bad let alone so many other girls
and laugh about it. I guess I talked to you guys out because I want to see the right thing
happen, not just to him, but I want people in the world to understand this is not the way
of life, you know, it’s not acceptable to go out procure young girls and make them think
that, this is the way you should be living and that’s all. Yeah, I guess my reason for
doing it is to help the bigger picture, you know, I’m a big believer in karma and I believe
that good things will come back to you, so I guess that’s why I’m doing this.

104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *77

the VRRA, the Justice Department must inform victims of federal crimes of services that are available to them, including
emergency medical and social services, counseling, and support. ?! The Department is further obligated to keep victims fully
informed about the status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and to the extent
that it will not interfere with the investigation. °* These rights to notice about emergency medical and social services *? as
well as to the status of the investigation of the crime °* obviously require the Department to identify victims of federal
crimes before formal charges have been filed. Indeed, the VRRA makes this point clear by directing the Department to not only
notify the victim about the status of the investigation but also about the later filing of charges against a suspected offender. °°
The VRRA then extends victims’ rights to information through the rest of the criminal justice process by requiring the
Department to provide notice to victims of such things as the imposed sentence and the defendant's release. °

The VRRA not only requires the Department to identify victims during the investigation of a crime, it also defines those
victims in a very similar fashion to the CVRA. The VRRA defines victim as a person that has suffered direct physical,
emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of a crime. °’ Thus, the Department is already routinely
identifying persons who have been harmed by federal crimes shortly after the commission of those crimes and well before
formal charging.

The Attorney General has also promulgated internal guidelines requiring Justice Department components to identify victims
rapidly after a crime. The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance provide that Department
responsibilities to crime victims begin as soon as possible after the detection of a crime at which they may be undertaken
[*78] without interfering in the investigation. Generally, this point in time is defined by the opening of a criminal
investigation. °°

Gtven the way the two statutes work, it would make no sense to artificially confine the CVRA's reach until after the filing of a
criminal complaint. Before then, victims will have often recetved information from the Department about the status of the
investigation. They might wish to confer with prosecutors about how the case is proceeding, and the CVRA extends to them a
right to confer. °? Similarly, while the Department is notifying victims about the services they may receive and the status of an
investigation, it is important that the victims be treated fairly. The CVRA extends the right to be treated fairly. '°° Indeed, it
would be absurd to think that Congress wanted to permit the Justice Department to treat crime victims unfairly until criminal
charges have been filed.

Instead of recognizing Congress's intent, OLC's 2011 memorandum simply cites to a series of cases in which courts concluded

that a victim of uncharged conduct should not be afforded statutory protections. !°! Yet none of these cases - United States v.

Medicare: Observations

e 46 million elderly Americans (15% of population) received an average
of $8,325 in tax-payer funded payments for healthcare in 2009 ($5,079
for hospital care; $3,246 for medical insurance & prescription drugs).

e On the surface, $8,325 in free healthcare benefits every year certainly
seems like a high number — 23% of annual per-capita income —
(although working Medicare recipients do pay Medicare taxes).

e As with employer-sponsored health insurance plans, if people, in effect, get
a free benefit (with little personal financial commitment), they may not be
especially diligent and frugal about how they ‘spend’ it. The same concept
extends beyond healthcare recipients to the healthcare providers.*

e When Medicare was created in 1965 to provide health insurance to elderly
Americans, 1 in 10 Americans received Medicare, now 1 in 7 Americans receives
Medicare...above the initial ‘plan.’

Note: *The issue that people overuse services for which they do not have personal financial commitment applies to most
private insurance as well. For a more detailed discussion, see slide 293. Data are inflation adjusted using BEA’s GDP price

Topic: The quixotic search for energy solutions

There’s no room to go through the complexities of the storage technologies shown below. Here are a couple of generalizations:

e Less expensive options like pumped hydro and compressed air storage require favorable sites with the right geology, which
are rare in nature and expensive to build from scratch (and often not located near electricity demand centers), and in the case
of compressed air, require co-located gas turbines for compression

e Many battery-based technologies suffer from high upfront capital or operating costs; low energy storage volumes; delayed
response times; safety issues (such as zinc bromine); or short lives (limited number of recharge cycles)

I had a meeting a few weeks ago which was notable for its The cost of electricity storage options
optimism and enthusiasm. I met with the managers of Eos Range of levelized costs, $ perkWh
Energy Storage, which is working on a zinc air battery solution $0.60

which aims to conquer all of the obstacles outlined in the second
bullet point above. If the Eos projections bear out, they will offer
battery storage at a capital cost of ~$160 per kWh, in the form of
a 1 MW battery that is the size of a 40 foot shipping container
(for 6 MWh of storage). As with the table on page 2, the concept —go.40
of “levelized cost” synthesizes upfront costs, financing costs,

useful life, fuel costs and ongoing maintenance expenses. Rather

than looking projections of capital costs per kWh, levelized cost $0.30
comparisons are more useful. As shown, Eos aims to be the
cheapest option that can be scaled, and flexibly and safely located
where needed. Note as well that they expect to be cheaper than
natural gas peaking plants. This is a relevant benchmark, since
most utilities rely on natural gas peaking plants to meet daily $0.10
peak load requirements and to compensate for intermittent

renewable generation of wind and solar. If storage works, the

need for lots of peaking facilities could disappear.

Eos has a prototype of its Zinc-Air technology that has run
around 2,000 cycles so far; we should all pray either for their
success, or for the success of similar efforts undertaken by their
competitors. Based on the outcome of energy dreams shown on
p.1, we should always be skeptical of breakthrough claims, given
the complexity of the challenge. Let’s hope for the best.

Here’s another look at the financial rewards to anyone who can figure this out. Note how demands on the Texas electricity
grid (ERCOT) are almost 100% inversely correlated with when the wind blows. Either ERCOT gets connected to the national
grid, storage solutions are invented, or a lot of wind energy continues to be underutilized. On the right, what happens when
70% of the grid’s transmission lines, transformers and circuit breakers are 25-30 years old: rising congestion problems,
signified by rising loading relief requests. Grid storage has the potential to alleviate some of this congestion.

len the democratic revolution from the Polish people
by failing to carry out a proper purge of communists
and their collaborators. PiS even initiated a cam-
paign to sully the reputation of Lech Walesa, leader of
the anticommunist Solidarity movement in the 1980s,
by accusing him of working as a communist agent.’

Since coming to power with a parliamentary majority
in October 2015, PiS has embarked on a course of
change that places it solidly in the illiberal camp, with
many of the initiatives mirroring those enacted by
Fidesz in Hungary.

As in Hungary, an initial focus for the new government
was securing control of the Constitutional Tribunal.
PiS has moved to pack the court with its own appoin-
tees, using tactics that are blatantly illegal according
to Polish law and which have drawn criticism both
from the EU and the United States.'* However, party
leader Jarostaw Kaczynski, who holds a seat in the
parliament but no formal government position, has
much greater ambitions to refashion Poland along
culturally conservative and politically illiberal lines.

The media are a major target. The government quickly
asserted control over public broadcasters and purged
them of journalists whom it regarded as loyal to the op-
position.’” PiS officials have also spoken of the need to
“restore balance” to the private media by, among other
things, taking measures to reduce foreign ownership of
key outlets. Already, the new government has used its
power over the allocation of state advertising to reward
friendly media and punish its critics.'®

The new government has involved itself in a debate
over history. It proposed a law that would punish those
who use the phrase “Polish death camps’ to refer to
sites established by Nazi Germany in Poland during
World War II.!9 PiS leaders have demonized scholars,
such as the eminent historian Jan Gross, who have
published research on the participation of Poles in

the persecution of Jews during the war. Gross was
questioned by a prosecutor on his research, and there
was talk of rescinding an award he had received.”° The
government threatened to withdraw support from the
useum of the Second World War, a project that was
near completion in Gdansk and enjoyed strong support
from such highly regarded scholars as Timothy Snyder
and Norman Davies. PiS complained that the museum
focused on all victims of the conflict rather than on
specifically Polish suffering.”?

Perhaps the most unsettling measure enacted under

the PiS government is an ambitious law that, in the
name of counterterrorism, gives the security services
sweeping powers over telecommunications and
personal information. With this legislation, Poland
became one of the first countries in the democratic
world to embrace the use of telecommunications
shutdowns in a particular area, a measure that
smacks of digital repression.??

The law gives Poland's domestic intelligence agency
unrestricted access to personal data without ap-
proval from a court or any other body. Tax reports,
vehicle information, insurance information, financial
statements, and other records are all now available

to the intelligence service of a government that has
made a point of naming party loyalists to key security
positions. The legislation also grants the domestic
security agency the ability to shut down websites. The
action can be reviewed by a court within five days, but
this is far from reassuring in light of the government's
efforts to exert political control over the judiciary.

The legislation is ostensibly needed to counter acts of
terrorism. But Poland has not experienced a terrorist
act since 1939, and has one of the smallest popula-
tions of Muslim immigrants—often perceived as a risk
factor for terrorism—in Europe. Furthermore, the law
is written in vague terms that give the government
great latitude to decide what is and is not an act of
terrorism.23 Given the PiS leadership's penchant for
smearing its political adversaries as traitors to the
Polish nation,”* it is not inconceivable that such a law

could one day be used against the opposition.

llliberalism’s preconditions

The triumph of illiberal governments in countries like
Hungary and Poland raises the question of whether
the phenomenon will spread further. Might illiberal-
ism come to dominate a society with much deeper
democratic roots—Austria, France, or even the United
States?

From a practical standpoint, illiberal forces are unlikely
to transform countries where the political divide is rel-
atively equal and the established parties have strong,
loyal followings.

It is only when the mainstream parties suffer cata-
strophic electoral setbacks that illiberal challengers
can rush into the breach.

The Socialist Party had governed Hungary for much of
the period since 1989, but it rapidly lost credibility due

the diplomatic equivalent of the battlefield, triumphant against the odds. It was the
role he liked and played best. His next move was to take the show on the road: to
Arab, European and world capitals, pleading that he had been the “victim” of
summit chicanery in which President Clinton and I had presented him with a deal
no self-respecting Palestinian could accept. He was also campaigning for
international support for a move, in contravention of the final Camp David
communiqué, to “declare” a Palestinian state unilaterally in mid-September.

I spoke personally to Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac, and also
dispatched Shlomo-Ben Ami, Amnon Lipkin, Yossi Beilin and Shimon Peres, who
was Minister of Regional Cooperation in the coalition, on a series of diplomatic
visits to make sure the true story of what had happened at the summit was
understood. As a result, the globetrotting Arafat received an almost unanimous
rebuff for the idea of a unilateral declaration of stateheood. He was told that if he
really wanted a state, he should return to the negotiating table with Israel.

By the time I went to New York in early September — joining the largest
collection of world leaders ever assembled, for the UN’s Millennium Summit —
there seemed little chance of that happening. I met privately with a number of
world leaders before delivering a brief address to the more than 150 presidents and
prime ministers. I was at pains to take the high road. None of the foreign leaders I
met had expressed any doubt that we’d gone much further than they had expected
at Camp David, and that the onus for putting diplomacy back on track rested firmly
with the Palestinians. Looking straight at Arafat from the UN podium, I said: “We
are at the Rubicon, and neither of us can cross it alone.” Jerusalem, “the eternal
capital of Israel,” was calling out for a “peace of honor, of courage and of
brotherhood” — a peace recognizing that the city was also sacred to Muslims and
Christians the world over. When Arafat spoke, it was almost as if the summit had
never happened. “We remain committed to our national rights over East Jerusalem,
capital of our state and shelter of our sacred sites, as well as our rights on the
Christian and Islamic holy sites,” he declared. He didn’t mention Jews, beyond a
bizarre reference to the 2,000 anniversary of the birth of Christ “in Bethlehem,
Palestine.” I couldn’t resist remarking to one of the American negotiators that I’d
always thought Jesus grew up as a Jewish boy, making thrice-yearly visits at
festival time to the temple in Jerusalem, at a time when there was not a church,
much less a mosque, in sight.

Atlantic Council 
Syria: Blackberry Diplomacy 
By Frederic C. Hof 
July 11, 2013 
, Mahle, Melissa 
, Seche, Stephen A. 
'Dixon, Timothy 
A friendly discussion about Syria with a former US State Department colleague gave rise to a point I will not soon forget. 
Fred, there's no time for policy deliberations about Syria or anyplace else. We live in the era of Blackberry diplomacy. We 
react and we improvise as best we can. 
Anyone under the age of thirty reading the above would probably think, Why in the world is the US government using the 
Blackberry? Those who turned thirty long before the end of the last century—even those of us who try seriously not to be 
technological Luddites—wonder sometimes if the communications revolution and the 24/7 news cycle it has spawned will 
end up doing more harm than good to the progress of civilization and well-being of the republic. 
Those who have had the privilege and burden of working in the US national security establishment are well-acquainted 
with how hard it is to find time to think. This was true long before the advent of email and other forms of electronic 
communication. Although there may have been times when officials could contemplate great matters of state at something 
approaching leisure, those days have been long gone. Even offices created expressly to explore policy options stretching 
beyond a twenty minute horizon—the State Department's Policy Planning Staff comes to mind—routinely get pulled into 
the maelstrom of daily struggles to manage breaking developments through some combination of strategic messaging 
and diplomatic demarches. Email makes it easy for officials up-and-down the chain to plunge into the fray, battling to mold 
language for use at a daily briefing; language that all-too-often mystifies or misleads foreign listeners who hang on words 
from the podium as if they are meant to convey the results of deep, deliberative thought on the part of the world's only 
superpower. Yet email neither created the problem nor prevents its solution. 
The problem is the failure of government, certainly in the context of Syria and likely in other foreign policy contexts as well, 
to wrap the daily news cycle food fight in an insulated casing of objectives and strategy clearly understandable to those 
charged with planning and executing foreign or national security policy. There may be some who believe that objectives 
and strategy are just so 20th century; so Brent Scowcroft-like and so pre-Twitter. There may be some who actually handle 
affairs of state in ways they would not dream of applying to their personal financial portfolios. Perhaps resistance to 
structured, deliberative processes producing objectives and accompanying strategies is a function of fewer and fewer 
people in the national security establishment ever having availed themselves of military service; an experience where 
matters of this nature become, through training and education, as natural as breathing. Perhaps in the specific case of 
Syria there has been a temptation to avoid the hard choices such a process would serve up in the hope that the regime of 
Basher al-Assad would just go away, thereby making hard choices someone else's problem. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030209 
The arrival of a new assistant to the president for national security affairs is an ideal opportunity to restore best practices 
to the national security apparatus. To her credit, Susan Rice appears to be reaching out with this very much in mind. If 
changes are made that better serve the president by forcing people to think through policy options in the context of 
objectives and strategies, those changes should not reflect poorly on the stewardship of her predecessor. The president 
gets precisely the national security system he mandates and deserves. He is, as JFK noted in the immediate wake of the 
Bay of Pigs fiasco, the responsible officer of government. 
In the end it is the president, and not the Blackberry or some other device, who will drive the direction and processes of 
foreign policy and diplomacy. It is up to him to tell his national security advisor that he wants the interagency to stop 
tweeting and start thinking; to tell him how he should be evaluating US national security objectives with respect to Syria 
(for example) and strategy options aimed at accomplishing them. This kind of deliberative process will not require people 
to wear powdered wigs and inscribe talking points on parchment with quill pens. It will not even oblige them to disconnect 
electronically. 
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to an orderly national security process that is deliberative is the sheer brainpower of the 
people sitting atop the bureaucratic pyramid. Barack Obama and Susan Rice are among the very brightest people to 
serve in the US government. They may think they can figure Syria out themselves, within a small circle of trusted political 
advisers. They may think they can handle Syria without reaching beyond their own national security staff, without probing 
deeply into the Departments of State, Defense, the intelligence community, and elsewhere where additional expertise 
resides. They will outsmart themselves if that is the approach they choose. 
Blackberry diplomacy is a choice, not a device decision and certainly not a fact of life. Even in this day and age, it is 
possible to figure out what one wants and how to go about getting it: even in government work.

Although Raiffeisen has already undergone a sales process twice, the last being 3
years ago, without success, I still consider the amount of its equity at EUR 350

million a very large amount to invest for gaining 0.8% more market share than that
of Ukrsib.

This information is as much I could gather but I will meet with EBRD for other
reasons and will try to extract more information mostly on the intentions of BNP in
dealing with their Ukrainian presence. From what I know EBRD’s 40% is
considered exceptionally high as equity participation percentage comparing to their
usual 10-15% and most probably they would be willing to listen to exit scenarios,
possibly remaining as shareholders at a lower percentage.

I think it is too early to discuss potential price but having EBRD inside already I
would assume that 1x less due diligence adjustments should be the maximum,

prominent neuroscientist Elizabeth Phelps suggest that directing our
thoughts of the future toward the positive is a result of our frontal
cortex's communicating with subcortical regions deep in our brain.
The frontal cortex, a large area behind the forehead, is the most
recently evolved part of the brain. It is larger in humans than in other
primates and is critical for many complex human functions such as
language and goal setting.

Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI) scanner, we
recorded brain activity in volunteers as they imagined specific events
that might occur to them in the future. Some of the events that I asked
them to imagine were desirable (a great date or winning a large sum
of money), and some were undesirable (losing a wallet, ending a
romantic relationship). The volunteers reported that their images of
sought-after events were richer and more vivid than those of
unwanted events.

This matched the enhanced activity we observed in two critical
regions of the brain: the amygdala, a small structure deep in the brain
that is central to the processing of emotion, and the rostral anterior
cingulate cortex (rACC), an area of the frontal cortex that modulates
emotion and motivation. The rACC acts like a traffic conductor,
enhancing the flow of positive emotions and associations. The more
optimistic a person was, the higher the activity in these regions was
while imagining positive future events (relative to negative ones) and
the stronger the connectivity between the two structures. The findings
were particularly fascinating because these precise regions — the
amygdala and the rACC — show abnormal activity in depressed
individuals. While healthy people expect the future to be slightly
better than it ends up being, people with severe depression tend to be
pessimistically biased: they expect things to be worse than they end
up being. People with mild depression are relatively accurate when
predicting future events. They see the world as it is. In other words,

days of the war, later inflicted heavy losses on one of Sadat’s armored forces
and was part of the final push on the other side of the canal. And, of course,
during Entebbe. Dan had sharp tactical instincts, a belief in the importance of
using new technology to gain and sustain an edge, and an openness to
unconventional approaches. Faced with a challenge in planning or executing an
operation, he looked at it from all sides, determined to come up with the right
approach, not always the expected one. In a lot of these ways, we were similar,
which was no doubt one reason our relationship had grown closer as he and I —
Six years younger, and a step or two behind — rose up the ranks.

In fact, Dan was the reason I’d made one of my rare forays into kirya politics
not long after Moshe Vechetzi took over as chief of staff, when Misha Arens was
still Defense Minister. I acted to derail what seemed to me a blatant attempt by
Moshe to advance Drori’s and Amnon Lipkin’s prospects for eventual
succession as chief-of-staff, and to take Dan out of the contest altogether.

I was sitting at my desk on the third floor when the chief of internal army
security, an officer named Ben-Dor, walked into my office. “Listen,” he said,
“the chief of staff has a right to give me a direct order in cases where he thinks
there is a need for a special investigation. But you’re my commander, so I
wanted to let you know.”

“What is it?” I asked.

He replied that he had been ordered to “check out rumors that Dan Shomron
is a homosexual.”

I was appalled. The whole thing stank, on every level, and not just because I
was confident the “rumors” were nonsense. “Look,” I said, “I have no idea
whether some sub-clause in army regulations allows the chief-of-staff to give
you orders over my head. But even if it does, I’m ordering you to do nothing
until I talk to Moshe.” He nodded in agreement. In fact, he seemed relieved. He
also let me know that the source of the rumors was a number of senior officers,
including a couple of generals.

I went straight downstairs and into the chief-of-staff’s office. Moshe was at
his desk, smoking a cigarette. One of the advantages he had in being nearly a
foot taller than most of us was that I found myself looking not into his eyes, but
up at them. “Moshe,” I said, “Ben-Dor told me you’ve ordered him to investigate
a rumor that Dan Shomron is a homosexual.” He said nothing. So I went on.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019266.txt,"BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

In May 2014, Putin signed a new law that criminalized
the purposeful distortion of the Soviet Union's role in
World War II. It could easily be applied to historians
who, for example, criticize Stalin's Great Terror and

its decimation of the military leadership in the years
before the war.'® Historians who make the “wrong”
interpretations of the Hitler-Stalin pact, the huge
casualties suffered by the Red Army, or the rape and
plunder committed by Soviet troops as they marched
toward Berlin might also risk criminal penalties.

In late 2016 the Russian Security Council discussed
the establishment of a new center to counter the
“falsification” of history. The council placed the pro-
posal in the context of the country’s national security,
pointing to “deliberate destructive activity by foreign
state structures and international organizations to
realize geopolitical interests by means of carrying out
anti-Russian policies.”

A group of experts identified six topics from Russia's
past that they claimed were being actively distorted
as part of an anti-Russia strategy. Among the topics:
the Soviet Union's ethnic policies, the Hitler-Stalin
pact, the Soviet Union's conduct during World War Il,
the 1917 Russian Revolution, and the Soviet Union's
suppression of uprisings in Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
and East Germany during the Cold War.” In each case,
the most serious and respected historical accounts
have been written by foreign scholars, due largely to

the pressures, including outright censorship, brought
to bear on Russian historians during Soviet times and

more recently during the Putin era.

China: Evading the past

Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward ranks among

the most deadly politically inspired catastrophes in
human history. From 1958 to 1962, Communist Party
authorities, under strict orders from Beijing, forcibly
herded millions of farmers into communes and then
proceeded to seize grain harvested in the countryside
to feed the urban population. The result, according to
long-standing estimates, was the death of some 30 mil-
lion people in the provinces. Historian Frank Dikotter,
who studied the archives in some of the most seriously
affected regions, has argued that the number of deaths
was at least 45 million, and others have cited higher
numbers. While most died of starvation, many were
tortured to death or murdered by local Communists.”

To this day, Communist Party officials have refused to
acknowledge anything approaching the full dimen-
sions of the tragedy. Nor have they admitted that the

party, and especially Mao, were responsible. Often
they blame the weather. There are no official monu-
ments to the victims, no days of commemoration, no
serious histories available to the general public, and
most significantly, no effort to place accountability
where it belonged.

Chinese leaders may be even more concerned about
presenting the “correct” interpretation of history
than their Russian counterparts. An updated offi-
cial version of the party history that was released in
2011 took 16 years to draft, including four extensive
rewrites. It was vetted by 64 state and party bodies,
including the People's Liberation Army. In telling the
story of the Great Leap Forward, the history admits
that the project brought great suffering, but credits
Mao with wanting to “change a picture of poverty and
backwardness and make China grow rich and strong
so that it could use its own strength to stand tall in
the forest of nations.””? In other words, one of the
century's great politically driven famines was justified
because it supposedly contributed to China's emer-
gence as a world power. The history also insists that
Mao tried to change course when he learned of the
growing rural suffering—an outright lie, as Mao actual-
ly doubled down on the most disastrous policies.

The determination to suppress any real assessment
of the dark corners of Chinese history under the
Communist Party is also reflected in the exhibits at
the National Museum of China in Tiananmen Square.
Mao's Cultural Revolution (1966-76), a period of polit-
ical terror and violent nationwide purges, is dispensed
with through one photograph and a brief caption,
located in an out-of-the-way part of the facility. As for
the famine, it is glossed over with the euphemistic
phrase, “the project of constructing socialism suffered
severe complications.’

Seven ‘don’t mentions’

In 2013, the General Office of the Communist Party
Central Committee issued a secret directive prohib-
iting universities from permitting the discussion of
seven themes—the “Seven Don't Mentions.” Accord-
ing to the directive, lecturers were not allowed to take
up universal values, freedom of the press, civil society,
civic rights, elite cronyism, Judicial independence, and
past mistakes of the Communist Party.

To independent-minded scholars, the most disturbing
item in the roster of Don't Mentions was the leader-
ship's mistakes. While the authorities have never come
close to permitting a serious investigation of either

Bernadotte.

“Why are you so strident,” Shamir asked me, only half-jokingly, after ’'d
insisted on joining a government discussion and pressing several intelligence
matters. “It’s because I’ve read the Lebanon inquiry,” I replied. “I saw what
happened when a message isn’t delivered assertively. I’m not going to be in the
position of making the same mistakes.” He nodded, and didn’t raise it again.

In fact, it was under Shamir that I began to get more involved with political
and policy issues beyond the armed forces. Part of this came with the job of
Rosh Aman. There was hardly a major domestic or foreign challenge that did
not have some security component, and no security matter on which intelligence
was not critical. But I also found myself working more closely with leading
politicians: mainly Shamir and Misha Arens, who as defense minister was my
main point of contact. Since I was a Labor kibbutznik, we made an odd
threesome. Arens was also a lifelong Jabotinsky Zionist. He had been in the
Betar youth movement in America, before going to Palestine in 1948 and
joining the Irgun. In fact, it was with Misha’s personal backing that one of my
former Sayeret Matkal officers — the son of a Jabotinsky acolyte — had recently
taken his first steps into the political limelight. After a two-year stint as Israel’s
number-two diplomat in Washington, Bibi Netanyahu had become our
ambassador to the United Nations.

With both Arens and Shamir, I built a solid relationship, based on mutual
respect, and it would deepen further when I moved on to a wider role in the
kirya a few years later. They were straight talkers. While resolute about
decisions once they’d taken them, they were genuinely open to discussion and
debate. I also sometimes found a surprising degree of nuance behind their tough
exterior.

The toughness was there, however. One of the first major security crises we
faced after Shamir became Prime Minister was known as the Kav 300 affair,
named for the bus route between the southern port city of Ashdod and Tel Aviv.
On the evening of April 12, 1984, four Palestinians from Gaza boarded the bus
and hijacked it back toward the border with Egypt. They told the passengers they
were armed with knives, and that a suitcase which one of them was carrying
contained unexploded anti-tank shells. After a high-speed chase, an Israeli army
unit managed to shoot out the tires and disable the vehicle, when it was still
about ten miles short of Gaza. One of the passengers had been severely injured at

performance of the Fund. Moreover, the current regulatory framework may change or
additional regulations may arise at any stage during the product development phase of a
portfolio company, which may affect the company’s ability to obtain approval of its products.

The Fund may invest in companies that will need to obtain patents for their products, both in
the U.S. and in other countries. The patent protection of the intellectual property of healthcare
technology companies in many countries is highly uncertain and involves complex legal,
scientific and factual issues. The policy regarding allowable claimed subject matter of life
sciences or healthcare technology patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Dependence on Single Products

Companies in which the Fund invests may only have one product under development. There
can be no assurance that the product will be approved for marketing by the FDA or any foreign
regulatory agency. Further, competition to the product may develop from other new and
existing products. In either case, if a company is dependent on that one product, the
consequences of such failure could be devastating to the prospects of such company, which in
turn could negatively affect the performance of the Fund.

Dependence on Reimbursement and Third-Party Pricing Policies for Products

The ability of the Fund’s portfolio companies to commercialize any product candidate
successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products
and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities,
private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party
payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which
medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A major trend in the U.S.
healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party
payors, particularly Medicare, have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the
amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are
requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and
are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Portfolio companies cannot be sure
that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that they commercialize,
and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory.

Reimbursement may affect the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which a
portfolio company obtains marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate
reimbursement for a portfolio company’s products may be particularly difficult because of the
higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician or
because a drug may be administered in combination with other drugs that may carry high
prices. A portfolio company may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies
to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies.
If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to
limited levels, a portfolio company may not be able to successfully commercialize any product
candidate for which it obtains marketing approval. This, in turn, could negatively affect the
performance of the Fund.

Capital Markets for

Cannabis Companies

m Capital Markets Overview

Hundreds, if not thousands, of cannabis-related companies are seeking to raise capital—thus pre-
senting investment opportunities for sophisticated investors who want to participate in the cannabis
industry. Investors have their choice of investing in the more than 300 publicly traded cannabis-related
companies, or in the significant number of private companies raising capital. Investors may also choose
among stock markets (both within the United States and internationally), type of security (equity
versus debt) and type of company (companies across all segments of the industry are raising capital).

It is important to note, however, that most of the cannabis-related companies that are raising cap-
ital—even publicly traded companies—are in early stages of development, have de minimis revenue
and are not profitable. More than 85% of the publicly traded cannabis-related companies have annual
revenue of less than $5 million, and less than 5% have annual revenue greater than $25 million.

Most investors in the cannabis industry today are retail or individual investors. While an increas-
ing number of family office and strategic investors are now participating in the cannabis industry,
we believe that many institutional investors (most notably the traditional venture capital and private
equity communities) will not invest in the industry until more companies in the industry mature and
the legal environment becomes more favorable.

Cannabis-related companies raised more than $2.0 billion in the public and private markets in
2017; however, except for a few transactions of notable size, many of the financings were small (less
than $5 million), which provides further evidence that the capital markets are being driven primarily
by retail investors. Without traditional institutional investor support, a funding gap exists in the indus-
try: companies are seeking to raise more capital than investors are willing or able to provide. We believe
that this is especially true in the private markets, where many companies struggle to raise financing.

We share the belief held by many that, ultimately, established companies from analogous indus-
tries—alcohol, pharmaceutical, tobacco and consumer products—will enter the cannabis industry

then in response to Hamas rocket fire into Israel. The moral: Arik was wrong to
withdraw. But the Islamists’ ascendancy was happening anyway. After all, it was
Hamas attacks that provided the spearhead of the intifada of terror launched in the
wake of Camp David. Arafat’s own influence was also inexorably on the wane by
the time he passed away, in Paris, at the end of 2004, to be succeeded by Abu
Mazen. I do not know of a single senior figure in Israel with any military
experience who believes that we would be more secure today if we still had
thousands of soldiers and settlers inside Gaza. Surprised though I was by Arik’s
decision to leave, I had no doubt that the fundamental security judgment he was
making — that a disengagement was in Israel’s own interest — was the right one. I
was encouraged, too, by his parallel announcement of a small, token withdrawal
from a few small West Bank settlements. My regret at the time was that he did not
go further toward the kind of major West Bank disengagement I’d been arguing
for, and that even in Gaza the pullout seemed insufficiently prepared or thought
out. The model, I believed, should have been our withdrawal from Lebanon —
involving detailed prior consultation with, and political support from, the UN and
key international allies. I also felt it was critically important to ensure that, while
we would obviously need offshore patrols to prevent arms and munitions from
getting in, we allowed and encouraged an environment in which the Gazan
economy could function and grow after we left. None of that happened. Though we
left Gaza, we effectively sealed off and blockaded one of the most densely
populated, economically strapped and politically febrile strips of land on the face
of the earth.

Still, I did see it as an important first step toward the kind of wider
disengagement that would prioritize Israel’s own security interests, and political
and social cohesiveness, until and unless conditions allowed a for a serious new
effort for a final peace deal. I was heartened when Shimon led Labor back into
Arik’s coalition at the start of 2005 to ensure he’d have the support necessary to go
through with the Gaza withdrawal. And while I did make a brief attempt to return
as party leader later in the year, when it was clear I wasn’t going to win, I threw
my support behind Shimon and against the other challenger, the longtime labor-
union leader Amir Peretz, who was running on a platform to take Labor out of
Sharon’s government.

But Peretz won the leadership election. He did leave the cabinet, forcing Arik to
call an early election for March 2006. And that, along with the most ambitious and

In Israel, Time for Peace Offer May Run Out

Ethan Bronner



April 2, 2011 — With revolutionary fervor sweeping the Middle East, Israel is under mounting pressure to make a far-reaching offer to the Palestinians or face a United Nations vote welcoming the State of Palestine as a member whose territory includes all of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. 

The Palestinian Authority has been steadily building support for such a resolution in September, a move that could place Israel into a diplomatic vise. Israel would be occupying land belonging to a fellow United Nations member, land it has controlled and settled for more than four decades and some of which it expects to keep in any two-state solution. 

“We are facing a diplomatic-political tsunami that the majority of the public is unaware of and that will peak in September,” said Ehud Barak, Israel’s defense minister, at a conference in Tel Aviv last month. “It is a very dangerous situation, one that requires action.” He added, “Paralysis, rhetoric, inaction will deepen the isolation of Israel.” 

With aides to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thrashing out proposals to the Palestinians, President Shimon Peres is due at the White House on Tuesday to meet with President Obama and explore ways out of the bind. The United States is still uncertain how to move the process forward, according to diplomats here. 

Israel’s offer is expected to include transfer of some West Bank territory outside its settlements to Palestinian control and may suggest a regional component — an international conference to serve as a response to the Arab League peace initiatives. 

But Palestinian leaders, emboldened by support for their statehood bid, dismiss the expected offer as insufficient and continue to demand an end to settlement building before talks can begin. 

“We want to generate pressure on Israel to make it feel isolated and help it understand that there can be no talks without a stop to settlements,” said Nabil Shaath, who leads the foreign affairs department of Fatah, the main party of the Palestinian Authority. “Without that, our goal is membership in the United Nations General Assembly in September.” 

Israeli, Palestinian and Western officials interviewed on the current impasse, most of them requesting anonymity, expressed an unusual degree of pessimism about a peaceful resolution. All agreed that the turmoil across the Middle East had prompted opposing responses from Israel and much of the world. 

Israel, seeing the prospect of even more hostile governments as its neighbors, is insisting on caution and time before taking any significant steps. It also wants to build in extensive long-term security guarantees in any two-state solution, but those inevitably infringe the sovereignty of a Palestinian state. 

The international community tends to draw the opposite conclusion. Foreign Secretary William Hague of Britain, for example, said last week that one of the most important lessons to be learned from the Arab Spring was that “legitimate aspirations cannot be ignored and must be addressed.” He added, referring to Israeli-Palestinian talks, “It cannot be in anyone’s interests if the new order of the region is determined at a time of minimum hope in the peace process.” 

The Palestinian focus on September stems not only from the fact that the General Assembly holds its annual meeting then. It is also because Prime Minister Salam Fayyad announced in September 2009 that his government would be ready for independent statehood in two years and that Mr. Obama said last September that he expected the framework for an independent Palestinian state to be declared in a year. 

Mr. Obama did not indicate what the borders of that state would be, assuming they would be determined through direct negotiations. But with Israeli-Palestinian talks broken off months ago and the Middle East in the process of profound change, many argue that outside pressure is needed. 

Germany, France and Britain say negotiations should be based on the 1967 lines with equivalent land swaps, exactly what the Netanyahu government rejects because it says it predetermines the outcome. 

“Does the world think it is going to force Israel to declare the 1967 lines and giving up Jerusalem as a basis for negotiation?” asked a top Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity. “That will never happen.” 

While the Obama administration has referred in the past to the 1967 lines as a basis for talks, it has not decided whether to back the European Union, the United Nations and Russia — the other members of the so-called quartet — in declaring them the starting point, diplomats said. The quartet meets on April 15 in Berlin. 

Israel, which has settled hundreds of thousands of Jews inside the West Bank and East Jerusalem, acknowledges that it will have to withdraw from much of the land it now occupies there. But it hopes to hold onto the largest settlement blocs and much of East Jerusalem as well as the border to the east with Jordan and does not want to enter into talks with the other side’s position as the starting point. 

That was true even before its closest ally in the Arab world, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, was driven from power, helping fuel protest movements that now roil other countries, including Jordan, which has its own peace agreement with Israel. 

“Whatever we put forward has to be grounded in security arrangements because of what is going on regionally,” said Zalman Shoval, one of a handful of Netanyahu aides drawing up the Israeli proposal that may be delivered as a speech to the United States Congress in May. “We are facing the rebirth of the eastern front as Iran grows strong. We have to secure the Jordan Valley. And no Israeli government is going to move tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes quickly.” 

Those Israelis live in West Bank settlements, the source of much of the disagreement not only with the Palestinians but with the world. Not a single government supports Israel’s settlements. The Palestinians say the settlements are proof that the Israelis do not really want a Palestinian state to arise since they are built on land that should go to that state. 

“All these years, the main obstacle to peace has been the settlements,” Nimer Hammad, a political adviser to President Abbas, said. “They always say, ‘but you never made it a condition of negotiations before.’ And we say, ‘that was a mistake.’ ” 

The Israelis counter that the real problem is Palestinian refusal to accept openly a Jewish state here and ongoing anti-Israeli incitement and praise of violence on Palestinian airwaves. 

Another central obstacle to the establishment of a State of Palestine has been the division between the West Bank and Gaza, the first run by the Palestinian Authority and the second by Hamas. Lately, President Abbas has sought to bridge the gap, asking to go to Gaza to seek reconciliation through an agreed interim government that would set up parliamentary and presidential elections. 

But Hamas, worried it would lose such elections and hopeful that the regional turmoil could work in its favor — that Egypt, for example, might be taken over by its ally, the Muslim Brotherhood — has reacted coolly. 

Efforts are still under way to restart peace talks but if, as expected, negotiations do not resume, come September the Palestinian Authority seems set to go ahead with plans to ask the General Assembly to accept it as a member. Diplomats involved in the issue say most countries — more than 100 — are expected to vote yes, meaning it will pass. (There are no vetoes in the General Assembly so the United States cannot save Israel as it often has in the Security Council.) 

What happens then? 

Some Palestinian leaders say relations with Israel would change. 

“We will re-examine our commitments toward Israel, especially our security commitments,” suggested Hanna Amireh, who is on the 18-member ruling board of the Palestine Liberation Organization, referring to cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli troops. “The main sense about Israel is that we are fed up.” 

Mr. Shaath said Israel would then be in daily violation of the rights of a fellow member state and diplomatic and legal consequences could follow, all of which would be painful for Israel. 

In the Haaretz newspaper on Thursday, Ari Shavit, who is a political centrist, drew a comparison between 2011 and the biggest military setback Israel ever faced, the 1973 war. 

He wrote that “2011 is going to be a diplomatic 1973,” because a Palestinian state will be recognized internationally. “Every military base in the West Bank will be contravening the sovereignty of an independent U.N. member state.” He added, “A diplomatic siege from without and a civil uprising from within will grip Israel in a stranglehold.”

The Arab spring - Follow the money

Samir Aita



April 2011 -- The reasons for the Arab spring go deeper than immediate demands for freedom and democracy. The protesters want to end the political economy and the authoritarian regimes in place since the 1970s.   Monarchies in the Arab world have been absolute, and life-long presidents (with hereditary office) ruled the republics, because they created a supreme power above both state and post-independence institutions (1). They set up and controlled their own security services to ensure that their powers would endure; the services escaped parliamentary or government supervision, and their members could reprimand a minister and impose decisions. It costs money to run such services, and the clientelist networks of one-party states. The funds derive not from public budgets, as do those for the police and the army, but from different sources of revenue. (The New York Times recently reported that Muammar Gaddafi had demanded in 2009 that oil firms operating in Libya should contribute to the $1.5bn he had promised to pay in compensation for the Lockerbie terrorist murders – or lose their licences. Many paid. And Gaddafi’s immediate cash holdings of billions of dollars are thought to be funding his mercenaries and supporters to defend him.)   After the spectacular 1973 rise in crude oil prices, Middle Eastern revenues increased considerably. Through the distribution circuits, and in collusion with major multinationals, part of the revenue went direct to the coffers of the royal or “republican” families instead of to the state. Nor was oil their only source of revenue. After there were no more commissions on major public contracts, civil and military, because of budget deficits and structural adjustments, new opportunities arose. In the 1990s there were mobile telephone network launches, and the first major privatisations of public services, with public-private partnerships and build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts. Mobile networks had massive margins, especially at the start when better-off clients were prepared to pay high prices. The major multinational operators, influential businessmen and governments fought to capture the income. (There is evidence for this in the legal dispute over Djezzy, the Algerian branch of the Egyptian operator Orascom, and the Algerian military, and in a previous dispute between Orascom and Syria’s Syriatel, which happened just as the first large Arab multinationals emerged.)   The globalisation of Arab economies and the demands of the International Monetary Fund – supported by the European Commission for the Mediterranean countries – tightened the regimes’ hold on the economy, especially after the oil price crash of 1986. The ensuing decline in public investment and weakening of the governmental regulatory role ensured that the major multinationals held monopolies or oligopolies in exchange for sharing revenue with the powers-that-be. The senior management of the global corporations knew exactly where major decisions were taken and who the imposed local partners were for any new investment: the Trabelsi and Materi families in Tunisia, the Ezz and Sawires in Egypt, the Makhlouf in Syria, Hariri in Lebanon. The Sawires sold their shares in Orascom-Mobinil to France Telecom and offloaded their cement holdings before the Egyptian revolution. Najib Mikati, who had sold Investcom to the South African group MTN, is currently in charge of appointing the new government in Lebanon.  Enthralled by the Dubai miracle, all the Arab countries ventured into real estate transactions that allowed them to dissimulate a public/private interest mix. Land was expropriated and then sold cheaply to property developers. Historic city centres were neglected but the local riad (traditional palaces) were renovated by international investors, charmed by the exotic East, and property prices rose on a par with London, Paris or Tokyo. None of this would have been possible without banking, which facilitated the laundering of revenue and found ways to recycle it in real estate and commercial transactions. Banks were also the instruments of governments, providing credit to secure the lasting allegiance of local entrepreneurs.

Erosion of public services

But the state weakened and public services eroded. Where there was a need to send representatives abroad or to tap expertise at home, government members were co-opted; the good ones were technocrats from major international institutions such as the World Bank, but they lacked electoral legitimacy or programmes for which they would be accountable. The state ceased to be seen as a bureaucracy. Even the army weakened as well-equipped praetorian guards guaranteed the continuity of power (2).

Arab governments bore no resemblance to those after independence, which had electrified the countryside and established universal public education. Public services deteriorated, as reports by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) observed, because of privatisations entirely for revenue raising. Even Jeddah in oil-rich Saudi Arabia only has running water one day a week; and a Saudi prince authorised construction work in a valley without planning drainage, resulting in lethal floods.   After every scandal there was an anti-corruption campaign, to little effect. The campaigns implied that corruption was a moral or religious issue rather than a systemic predation by leaders in alliance with business. Human dignity and work values were flouted. About a third of the working population in Arab countries is in the unofficial economy, in small jobs not included in unemployment statistics, which have been in double digits for a decade. Another third are self-employed, or employees without work contracts, social security, retirement or union rights. The concept of the employee is disappearing, outside the public sector and government. There, social rights have been maintained and so jobs are coveted, especially by women, but openings are rare, because of the “structural adjustment” policies required by government spending cuts. The labour market is also fragmented by massive migration, both permanent (Palestinians, Iraqis or Somalis fleeing war) and temporary (mainly Asian), where migrants’ economic and social rights are eroded, because the exploitation of migrant labour is now a source of revenue.   When the generation of the Arab demographic boom reached working age in the 2000s, connected by the new internet culture, the base toppled the summit in Tunisia and Egypt, and the entire social structure was shaken. People have been surprised by the many demands, social and otherwise, released by the revolution. Arab countries now have to rebuild the constitutional state, where power is finite and subject to institutions, instead of levitating above them. Government-dependent sources of revenue will have to be dismantled, as will monopolies, to release entrepreneurial energy. There will have to be states that guarantee public and social freedoms for all, so that workers have rights, and the states will have to be accountable, based on social consensus. It isn’t going to be easy, because the world, including Europe, isn’t going that way.

Obama doctrine? If only

Michael Boyle



2 April 2011 - In his speech on Monday night, President Obama articulated his rationale for the ongoing military campaign in Libya, claiming that a failure to act would have permitted humanitarian catastrophe that would have would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world. His argument was essentially one of moral emergency, implying that anyone chastened by the failure of the US and European governments to act in Rwanda and similar cases should recognise the necessity of acting in Libya.

But as recent events have demonstrated, a compelling moral case does not equate to a coherent strategy. Indeed, it is charitable to call this strategy muddled. Initially committed to only to defensive operations to stop the advance of the Libyan military into cities like Benghazi, the Obama administration quickly began working with the rebels to coordinate air strikes to push back Gaddafi's forces. This turned the US, Britain and France into combatants in a civil war; no matter how much they claim only to be engaged in kinetic military action or some other Orwellian euphemism, the facts are plain. There are now CIA officers present in Libya to coordinate air strikes with rebels, and the US has flown over 1,600 sorties. While the American public may be fooled by the dissembling language, Gaddafi and his regime will have no illusions about who is bombing them.

Now, if only to underscore this point that this is a real war, the US and its allies are considering sending weapons to the Libyan rebels. Even contemplating this reflects an astonishing level of ignorance: the weapons will embolden the rebels and increase the chances of a bloody, long-running stalemate between the Gaddafi regime and the rebels. The coalition effort has gone from babysitting a civil war to sponsoring it, ignoring precedents such as Afghanistan that make clear that flooding a country with weapons leads only to higher death tolls and vicious blowback over the long run.

All of this could be forgivable if the Obama administration or its European partners had shown an iota of forethought about the potential consequences of their actions. Instead, they appear to have rushed into this operation without a workable Plan B. Their hope was that air strikes and the pressure of rebel advances would cause the regime to crumble. But Gaddafi's forces – still vastly more powerful than the rebels – have reversed their losses and a stalemate looks more likely. Further, even high-profile defections have not yet appeared to influence Gaddafi's (admittedly less than rational) thinking. Unless he is killed or otherwise overthrown, Gaddafi can continue to hold out, supported by a small number of loyalists and family members, in the hope that he can prolong the war to the point where the costs begin to exceed the potential benefits for US and its coalition partners. Given that he faces exile, indictment or death if he is overthrown, he has every incentive to do just that.

If that happens, the only option left would be to place US or allied ground troops to assist rebels in forcing Gaddafi out of power. But Secretary Gates has emphasised repeatedly that there will be no boots on the ground. Having taken escalation through ground forces off the table, what then is the next step? How will additional pressure on Gaddafi be generated?

More to the point, what exactly is the strategy if the cumulative effect of the action so far is to produce the siege of Tripoli?

Instead of confronting these questions in a hardheaded way, the Obama administration has been obsessed with demonstrating the international legitimacy of the operation, pointing to a UN mandate and the support of the Arab League. But diplomatic blessings do not change the facts of war. Even the transfer of command authority from the US to Nato is mere window-dressing; it is the same set of countries bombing Libyan forces, no matter what acronym they hide behind. It is a peculiar form of bureaucratic myopia to worry more about who sits in what chair in Brussels than about the consequences of poor strategy.

Even more depressingly, the political debate in the US over the Libyan operation has become grotesque, as the same players who served as cheerleaders for the Iraq war have come out in force to celebrate this war as a step forward for human rights. The same liberal internationalists who chided President Bush for seeking regime change in Iraq have applauded President Obama for taking similar action in Libya, despite the fact that the operations in Libya are well beyond the measures to protect civilians authorised in the UN security council resolution.

Similarly, the neoconservatives have seen this operation as a vindication of President Bush's strategy, and a reaffirmation of the right of the US to remove the leader of a foreign country if it suits out interests to do so. Neither party is behaving responsibly here. The Republican presidential candidates are stumbling over themselves finding ways to denounce President Obama for doing precisely what they would have done if put in his position. Meanwhile, few on the Democratic side appear to be willing to push the president to explain his nonsensical position that Gaddafi must go, but that the objective of the US is not regime change.

Perhaps the most dispiriting aspect of this operation is that it proves that President Obama has been seduced by the power of the Oval Office into betraying many of the promises he represented as a candidate. The same thoughtful man who once argued that the US should never go to war without a congressional authorisation did not seek one, and waited ten days before even addressing the American public about his rationale for the operation. The same president who pledged in his national security strategy to take into account the limitation of our economic resources in his foreign policy decisions has led us into a war costing hundreds of millions of dollars. The same president once critical of a rush into a dumb war has let a compelling moral cause turn the US into a party in another war in the Middle East.

The unfortunate result is that President Obama has begun to resemble his predecessor far more than he or his supporters would care to admit.

American foreign policy - Why it's a theory, not a doctrine



31 march -- IT IS Pavlovian. As soon as a president does something new in foreign policy, the world wants to know whether he has invented a new “doctrine”. The short answer in the case of Libya is that Barack Obama has not invented a new doctrine so much as repudiated an old one. What he is also doing, however, is challenging an American habit of mind.

The doctrine Mr Obama has repudiated is the one attributed to Colin Powell, the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and George W. Bush’s transparently miserable secretary of state when America invaded Iraq in 2003. That held, among other things, that America ought to go to war only when its vital interests are threatened, when the exit strategy is clear, and when it can apply overwhelming force to ensure that its aims are achieved. Nothing could be more different from the account Mr Obama gave Americans on March 28th of his reasons for using military force in Libya. He does not believe that America’s vital interests are at stake (though some “important” ones are); the exit strategy is not entirely clear (Colonel Qaddafi must go, but who knows when, and not as a direct result of American military action); and the force America is willing to apply (no boots on the ground) is strictly limited.

None of this should be a surprise. In “The Audacity of Hope”, the bestseller Mr Obama wrote as a senator in 2006, he set out a theory of military intervention. Like all sovereign nations, he argued, America has the unilateral right to defend itself from attack, and to take unilateral military action to eliminate an imminent threat. But beyond matters of clear self-defence, it would “almost always” be in its interest to use force multilaterally. This would not mean giving the UN Security Council a veto over its actions, or rounding up Britain and Togo and doing as it pleased. It would mean following the example of the first President Bush in the first Gulf war—“engaging in the hard diplomatic work of obtaining most of the world’s support for our actions”. The virtue of such an approach was that America had much to gain in a world that lived by rules. By upholding such rules itself, it could encourage others to do so too. A multilateral approach would also lighten America’s burden at times of war. This might be “a bit of an illusion”, given the modest power of most American allies. But in many future conflicts the military operation was likely to cost less than the aftermath: training police, switching the lights back on, building democracy and so forth.

The president, it now emerges, remembers exactly what he wrote. He hesitated about whether to act in Libya (just ask the French and British, who egged him on but came close to losing hope), but he was always clear about how. All the conditions he wished for in that book five years ago have come to pass. In this week’s speech he ticked them methodically off: “an international mandate for action, a broad coalition prepared to join us, the support of Arab countries, and a plea for help from the Libyan people themselves. We also had the ability to stop Qaddafi’s forces in their tracks without putting American troops on the ground.” Under such circumstances, he said, for America to turn a blind eye to the fate of Benghazi would have been “a betrayal of who we are”.

Why does this theory of intervention, and the noble sentiment attached to it, fail to qualify as a “doctrine”? Because it is too elastic to provide a guide to future action. Would America “betray” itself by turning a blind eye to atrocities under different, less favourable, circumstances? So it seems. It has, after all, done so before, in Rwanda and Darfur—and Mr Obama appears to accept that it might have to do so again when, say, an alliance would be damaged, as in Bahrain, or the job is too hot to handle, as in Syria or Iran. Also unclear is whether an American interest must also be at stake before Mr Obama invokes the moral case for action. Conveniently (for the purpose of selling this particular war), the president detects a “strategic interest” in preventing Colonel Qaddafi from chilling the wider Arab spring, so nobody knows. 

In fairness, elasticity is not a sin; and Mr Obama does not claim to have invented anything he calls a “doctrine”. The worst you can say about his approach is that it is merely commonsensical: decide the issues case-by-case while holding some idea of values and interests in mind. Many who say they want more consistency than this (typically by asking some variant of “What about Zimbabwe?”) do so not because they really believe that foreign policy can be run by an algorithm but in order to embarrass Mr Obama in any way they can. Prize chump in the case of Libya this past fortnight has been Newt Gingrich, the Republican presidential hopeful who demanded consistency, called for intervention and turned on a dime the instant Mr Obama answered.

After you, Sarko

More significant, however, is that habit of mind. In Libya Mr Obama is challenging the assumption of global leadership America has taken for granted ever since the second world war. America has joined coalitions before, but never under a president quite so adamant that America is not in charge—even if the military burden-sharing is indeed a bit of an illusion. 

Most Republicans and quite a few Democrats hate this. Mr Obama’s hope is that America’s low profile will make the war more palatable not only to the Muslim world but also to the economy-fixated voters at home who question whether America can still afford to play its traditional leadership role. What he may soon discover is that modesty extracts a price of its own. By sharing the leadership with others, he has made his policy hostage to the limited mandate (no use of force for regime change) imposed by the United Nations and the limited means of his allies in Europe and the Middle East. It may not be a doctrine, it should not be a surprise, but nobody can deny that it is a gamble.

Struggling to Restart Egypt's Stalled Revolution

Eric Trager



CAIRO, Egypt -- Egypt's popular revolt was on the ropes. Tahrir Square had been mostly empty for weeks. Top regime figures remained free men. And on Wednesday, the Supreme Military Council released a revised constitution that, among other things, retained a Mubarak-era provision mandating that 50 percent of the parliament consist of workers and farmers. 
They are enabling the traditional forces to enter into and win the elections, said Shadi al-Ghazali Harb, an executive member of the Coalition of Revolutionary Youth, on Thursday evening.
Meanwhile, the youth organizations that had catalyzed the early stages of the revolt remained deeply divided on whether to keep protesting and, more importantly, on how to guide Egypt's political future.
On Friday, Egypt's youth activists overcame their impasse by agreeing on the past. Echoing scenes of two months prior, tens of thousands of Egyptians packed Tahrir Square to demand that former President Hosni Mubarak and his deputies be put on trial, and that the public funds they stole from the Egyptian people be returned. Posters carried images of former officials behind bars and activists chanted for the capture of former Shura Council president Safwat Sherif, former parliamentary speaker Fathi Sorour, and former chief of presidential staff Zakaria Azmi. The military had held control of the country for seven weeks but, for the Tahrir faithful, the villains remained the same.

But we need to be patient and we don't have time.

We still have ministers whose money has not been investigated, said Maged Abduh, a businessman. Zakaria Azmi is still working, as is Fathi Sarour. Why didn't they bring them and ask them about their money?
Yet for many in Tahrir, the turnout was cause for hope. The demonstration's organizers had overcome many hurdles in the previous days -- in particular, a series of suspiciously widely distributed, anonymous messages falsely claiming that the demonstration had been postponed until next week. And although it fell well short of the million-man march that the organizers had promised, the return of flag-carrying crowds signaled to the military that the shaab -- the people -- remained invested in their revolution.
It was good to send the message that we can have more protests, because people think and feel that the process is too slow, said Abdullah Helmi, a member of the Union of Revolutionary Youth. 
The demonstration took place without the participation of the Muslim Brotherhood, which stood aside despite the pleas of its younger members. The Brotherhood's Guidance Office claimed that they had not been informed of the demonstration early enough to make a decision. They told their youth leaders that they feared a low turnout. 
They have their own way of dealing with the issue, said Muslim Brotherhood youth leader Islam Lotfi, sounding disappointed.
But Friday's demonstration still leaves Egypt's could-be revolution searching for a way forward. While liberals and leftists dominated the square -- at one point, the crowds jeered at a Salafist who took the stage -- the overwhelming majority seemed to be independents, with a handful of small, newly forming parties scattered about. They have no leader or even set of leaders who can channel their demands for a better future into a widely agreeable program, and nobody can credibly represent them before the military council. So for now, the masses can only unify against things.
The liberals have many small parties, and the left as well, said former liberal Wafd party chairman Mahmoud Abaza. I think the hope of having a constitution that the Egyptian people will create and the fear of being squeezed between the army and the Islamists will create some opportunities for this front. But we need to be patient and we don't have time.
Still, Egypt's opposition groups may soon run out of things to oppose. In anticipation of Friday's demonstrations, the military announced the day before that Mubarak's top aides had been banned from leaving the country. If the military fully relents and opens investigations into their activities and finances, it may be hard for youth and liberal activists to convince people to return in droves to Tahrir Square. After all, the remaining demands from the revolution will have been met.
For the protesters still taking to Tahrir Square, and for those wary that the military could ultimately retain its grip on power, saving Egypt's revolution will require a liberal program for moving the country forward -- and fast. The longer that Egypt's revolutionary groups can only rally around rejecting the already-rejected Mubarak regime, the greater the advantage of illiberal forces in shaping the country's future.

Qatar's Quest to Become the Leading Arab State

Simon Henderson


March 31, 2011 -- The small Persian Gulf state of Qatar is emerging as a significant international player in the Libyan crisis and a crucial supporter of U.S. policy. But its relationship with the United States has often been difficult, and its standing in the rest of the Arab world is questionable. For Washington, the challenge is to achieve balance between U.S. expectations, Qatar's own regional ambitions, and the need to minimize any adverse impact on U.S. ties with other Arab allies. 

Background 

The Qatari peninsula is about the size of Connecticut, but most of its population -- around 200,000 citizens and 600,000 expatriate workers -- lives in and around the capital, Doha. A member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the emirate produces relatively little oil. Instead, its growing wealth is the result of having the third-largest natural gas reserves in the world (after Russia and Iran). Qatar is now the world's top exporter of liquefied natural gas, with Asia particularly reliant on its supplies. Revenue from these sales has given Qataris the highest per capita gross domestic product ($88,000) in the world, almost twice the figure for Americans. 

In recent days, Qatar became the first Arab state to contribute to no-fly-zone patrols over Libya and recognize the Benghazi-based rebels as legitimate successors to the Qadhafi regime. It has also offered its status and experience in OPEC to help the rebels market the Libyan oil and gas production that they control. In addition, the emirate was a major participant in the March 29 London conference regarding the crisis, and the first meeting of the follow-on Libya Contact Group will soon be held under Qatari chairmanship in Doha. 

Qatar's leading representative at the London meeting and the driving force of its foreign policy is Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who serves as both prime minister and foreign minister. HBJ, as he is widely known, is only a distant relative of ruler Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, but the two leaders have an extraordinarily close working relationship, and HBJ is credited with making many of the emir's visions a reality. 

Meanwhile, Qatar's Aljazeera satellite television channel is among the most watched in the region; the emir's (second) wife, Sheikha Mouza, is the driving force in encouraging American universities to set up branches in Doha and develop a world-class medical city; and Qatar has been chosen as the venue for the 2022 World Cup. The emirate is also becoming an increasingly large business conglomerate, with a national airline fleet that will soon exceed 100 aircraft, and a sovereign wealth fund t hat purchased Harrods, the iconic London store, in 2010, and owns the largest share of stock in a British supermarket chain. 

Activist Foreign Policy 

If Qatar's foreign policy appears eclectic in substance, its style often seems inconsistent -- and challenging even to its friends. Over the past several years, Qatar has tried to distinguish itself from the other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman) by being friendlier toward Iran and less publicly fearful of the Islamic Republic's nuclear ambitions. To the consternation of other GCC leaders, Qatar invited President Mahmoud Ahmadinezhad to Doha for the council's 2007 summit. Privately though, Qatar is cynical about Iran's aspirations. As HBJ once told an American official, [The Iranians] lie to us, and we lie to them. 

More generally, Qatar tends to use Aljazeera as a tool of diplomacy. The network's coverage of domestic Qatari affairs is limited -- instead, Aljazeera news programming often seems aimed at annoying other Arab states. The United States was also a regular target of the network after the invasion of Iraq. For example, one false story broadcast in 2005 alleged that U.S. soldiers in Iraq were removing women's veils. The report caused widespread outrage in the Arab world and, according to then deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz, was responsible for the killing of more than 100 American personnel. Qatari officials protested their innocence, claiming that Aljazeera was independent of government control and was permitted freedom of expression. Yet the output of the Arabic news channel and associated website suggests that they omit stories that might damage important diplomatic relationships (although the English channel and website are less constrained and more objective). 

Qatar has also sheltered or otherwise affiliated itself with prominent regional radicals. In addition to hosting Hamas leader Khaled Mashal, the emirate has permitted firebrand Egyptian cleric Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi to broadcast a regular show on Aljazeera for years now, despite episodes justifying suicide attacks on Israeli children on the basis that they will grow up to become soldiers. And in the mid-1990s, Qatar allowed al-Qaeda terrorist Khaled Sheikh Muhammad, wanted by the United States for plotting aircraft bombings, to live in Doha, where he was given a government job and protected by a state minister. 

Outreach to Israel and the U.S. Military 

After Sheikh Hamad overthrew his indolent father in 1995, Doha worked to develop better ties with Washington, which at the time tended to view its relations with Arab Gulf states through the prism of neighboring Saudi Arabia. Among Qatar's tactics was deliberate outreach to Israel as a means of countering potential U.S. congressional opposition. At one point, this led to an Israeli diplomatic office operating under commercial cover in Doha. Yet when presented with a reciprocal offer to open a Qatari office in Israel, the emirate ignored it, while the Israeli presence in Doha met with criticism from other Arab states and was eventually closed. 

On a grander scale, Qatar speculatively built the giant al-Udeid Air Base a few miles outside Doha. Following the September 11 attacks, U.S.-Saudi relations grew tense, and Riyadh asked Washington to stop using the Prince Sultan Air Base and its associated Combined Air Operations Center. Qatar was thus able to step in and offer the United States instant access to al-Udeid. Today, the U.S. military runs most of its regional operations out of the base, including patrols to counter any hostile moves by Iran a hundred miles to the north and flights over Afghanistan six hundred miles to the east. Yet U.S. forces do not have carte blanche over al-Udeid: the Qatari military jealously guards its sovereign control over access to the facility even though its own small air force does not use it, instead operating from one side of the capital's main international airport. 

Largely Symbolic Role in Libya 

Qatar is taking great pride in its role in stemming the Libyan crisis. As the Qatari air force chief of staff put it: Certain countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt haven't taken leadership for the last three years. So we wanted to step up and express ourselves, and see if others will follow. 

In actuality, however, the Qatari military is greatly limited in both size and capability. The four Mirage 2000 jets that Doha deployed to Greece for Libyan operations represent the bulk of its operational air force. And two of those aircraft nearly failed to arrive, having to divert to Cyprus after running short of fuel en route. Reliant on servicing by French and other foreign technicians, the aircraft are not expected to see any real military action. 

U.S. Policy and the Emir's Upcoming Visit 

Qatari society does not recognize the universal freedoms that guide the Obama administration's foreign policy, but there is little domestic opposition to the emir's rule, which is marked by generous subsidies and traditional Gulf accessibility. Nevertheless, the administration should make the most of Sheikh Hamad's upcoming visit to Washington, originally scheduled for February but now seemingly slated for April. Doha will want to use the visit to confirm its new diplomatic status. Yet Washington must balance its gratitude for ongoing access to al-Udeid and the emirate's diplomatic support on Libya with the recognition that Qatar still has to prove itself as a reliable and consistent ally. Ultimately, Doha seeks guarantees of U.S. protection against Iran, which should be a win-win situation for Washington. But Doha is worried about the commitment of the Obama administration to deal with Qadhafi as well as Iran. Other U.S. Middle East allies will be watching closely to see how Washington handles its new best friend.

understand in this book how these struggles will unfold and how to fight them - but
keep in mind that this means, in fact, a deeper conflict. A fight about values.
Networks are like any organized system; they reflect the aims and ethics and habits

Law.”21 Melvin Conway was an early AT&T systems designer who noticed that the
organization of any connected telephone system had an impact on the communities
or offices it touched. Who could call who was a kind of power map. The physical
world, Conway realized, could be shaped and influenced by something other than a
physical force; it could be reshaped by information flows, by connection. The
expansion of airline routes to Indonesia, for instance, was a network design change
that tilted real-life economic patterns. New flights enabled tourism, manufacturing,
investment. In our connected age, the design of research studies, voter databases,
genetic information sharing networks, financial webs - all of these will create
bumps in the surface of our every day lives.2? The way in which phones or data links
or mobile devices are tied together changes the way we act when we use them or
when we handle them to touch each other, even if the design of these systems is
insensible to us most of the time - the way a marble under a carpet might create a
surprising bump. Networks can organize themselves in many different ways. And in
the choice of layout, or the evolution of that layout in response to pressures of profit
or technology, a great deal can be decided. “When you decide what infrastructure to
use for a project, you're not just making a technical decision,” the programmer and
investor Paul Graham has written. “You're also making a social decision, and this

they were taking up the place of a man who would actually practice law, while they got married
and raised children.

Dean Griswold wasn’t particularly comfortable with Jews either. At the same dinner, he noticed
that I didn’t eat the meat, and he asked me why. I told him I was kosher, to which he responded:
“Even the Catholics have eliminated the prohibition against eating meat on Friday. Don’t you
think it’s time for your people to eat what everyone else eats.” I thought he was kidding, so I
said: “Ill check with my people.” He wasn’t kidding. The next time I saw him I said: “I’ve
checked with my people and they said that they’ve been keeping kosher for thousands of years, so
a few more centuries couldn’t hurt.” He didn’t laugh. I think this exchange kept me kosher for
an extra few years!

For more than a year, Griswold called me “Shapiro,” which was the name of another assistant
professor, with whom I had nothing in common, except a Jewish sounding name. Griswold
demanded that I teach classes on Saturday. I refused. He said he couldn’t make a special
exception for me because I was a practicing Jew. I still refused. So he abolished all Saturday
classes.

Shortly after I was appointed to the Harvard Law School faculty, I received a call from Judge
Aldrich inviting me to present a talk to the members of his private club, called the “Club of Odd
Volumes.” He assured me that its members included some of the best and most important
lawyers in Boston, including several Justices of the Supreme Court and other judges. “We invite
all the new dons to tell us about their work,” he advised me.

Remembering Judge Bazelon’s refusal to speak to the members of Justice Douglas’ restricted
club, I politely told Judge Aldrich that I would get back to him. I then called the head of the local
Anti-Defamation League and inquired about the Club of Odd Volumes. “They don’t accept Jews,
Catholics, Blacks or women as members,” he quickly responded. I called Judge Aldrich, and told
him that I had a strict policy against speaking at any “restricted” club and so I would respectfully
have to decline his kind invitation. (I adopted that “policy” that day, having never before been
invited to speak at a restricted club.) He thanked me for considering it and hung up the phone.
Within an hour, I was abruptly summoned into the Dean’s Office.

Dean Erwin Griswold informed me that I had offended one of the Law School’s most important
and influential alumni, that I was the only assistant professor ever to turn down an invitation to
speak at that club and that it was important for untenured faculty to present their work there
because several of the members served on the Harvard Board of Overseers that had to approve all
tenure decisions. “You’ve hurt your chances,” he chided me. “Why did you decline their
invitation? Will you reconsider it if I can get them to invite you again?”

I explained my reasons. Griswold, who despite his Midwest origins considered himself an
honorary Brahman, was a cautious advocate of civil rights and civil liberties, so I thought he
would understand. What I did not know was that he himself was a member of a restricted club.
Nevertheless, he paused, looked directly at me and said, “While I don’t agree with you,
considering your background I can understand why you would feel uncomfortable at that club.
Pll call Bailey and try to explain. I hope he understands, and I hope you haven’t hurt your

We estimate share buybacks add $4 (or as high as $6) to EPS (GAAP & non-GAAP)
If the full $1.2tn that we estimate for overseas cash for the S&P 500 ex. Financials &
Real Estate is brought back (given the tax is mandatory and will be paid either way) and
50% is used on buybacks (~3% of S&P 500 market cap), this could add ~$4 to S&P 500
EPS. And if 80% (~4% of market cap) were used on buybacks, similar to NBER’s
estimate of what occurred following the 2004 tax holiday, this could add $6 to EPS.
(The difference between the Trump and Blueprint tax rates is small, leading to only
cents in index EPS.) If one assumed companies only brought half of their offshore cash
home immediately, even though the full amount was taxed, these benefits would be cut
in half.

Note that buyback programs may span several years, which could spread out some of
the EPS benefit below. But if one assumes a buyback is fully executed in Year 1, this
provides a one-time boost to EPS growth and a recurring benefit to future EPS given a
permanently lower share count.

Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 20 of 23

next thing I knew, I was sent my victim’s letter, my notification of being a victim through
the US Attorney’s Office and that’s when I knew it was well out there enough not to have
Jeffrey’s lawyers come back on me and discredit me in the same way he had done to all
the other girls. So, I called up Joseph Bird who was the recommended lawyers on my
paperwork that they had given me and started going from there.

JS: So you contact Mr. Joseph Bergs’ office and then you were dealing with his office from
that point forward.

V: That’s correct.

JS: Tell me about the ending of your relationship with Jeffrey. That is, at what point in time
did your full time employment end and how did that happen?

V: Ok. So, it hadn’t really ended. I walked away from it all. Jeffrey sent me to Thailand
where I met my husband and escaped to Australia, never to return back to the states.
About 6-months prior to that, he came up with a proposition that I thought was really
disgustingly sick. And it really showed me for the first time in 4 years I had been with
him that nothing was going to change and I was always just going to be used by him(?)
which I did not like. He offered me a mansion and some of his money every month, I
forget what he called it, a monthly income of what he made to bear one of his children.
The proposition was that if anything ever happened between Jeffrey and I, that I would
have to sign my child over to him basically and that the child would be his and
Ghislaine’s, and I would be looking after it as long as nothing happened between Jeffrey
and I. So, I was kind of freaked out by all of that. I pushed Jeffrey more to please get me
some more training, you know, and I was getting older and not of as much interest to
Jeffrey anyways. I was 19 now, and he likes a female a lot younger. So he sent me to
Thailand, in September 2002_. I was first supposed to meet a girl there and bring her
back with me, but I never met up with her. I proceeded get a short course in Thai massage
so that was to shut me up about my training so I went there, and one of my friends from
school invited me to watch a fight, like a muay thai fight, which is like a form
kickboxing. So I went and watched it, and I saw this guy that was a really good fighter,
and a girl’s word, looked really hot, so I asked my friend who knew him to introduce me.
We got introduced and fell in love immediately, 3 days later Rob proposed and 7 days
later I was being married in a buddist temple. I called Jeffrey and told him I’m sorry, I’m
never coming back. I’ve gotten married, I’ve fallen in love. I thought he’d wish the best
for me but he was kind of rude and he just said “have a good life” and hung up the phone,
and that was the last time I'd talked to him ever until all this started again.

JS: Ok. Virginia, is there anything else that you would like to add to what you have told us
up to this point in time?

V: I'd like to know that this time around something’s going to be done about it and that
Jeffrey and a lot of his colleagues, no matter how rich they are, will know that there is

“Six government employees...” Matt Apuzzo, “C.I.A. Officer Is Found Guilty in
Leak Tied to Times Reporter,” New York Times, January 26, 2015. The notable
exception to policy of seeking imprisonment of intelligence workers found guilty of
passing classified information to journalist is the extraordinary case of ex-CIA director
General David Petraeus. General Petraeus had given classified information from his
personal notebooks to his mistress and biographer, Paula Broadwell. Although none of
this information appeared in her 2012 biography A// In: The Education of Davis
Petraeus, he had violated his oath to protect this information. Yet, in a 2014 deal with
the Justice Department, General Petraeus was allowed to plead guilty to a
misdemeanor charge and sentenced to two years probation and a $100,000 fine. See

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019500.txt,"L2 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS

tery I was going to solve on this first trip to Hong Kong. I needed to
know more about his activities before he got there. After all, Snowden
was not, as he himself pointed out from Moscow, an “angel descend-
ing from the heavens.” He had been working for the U.S. govern-
ment for the previous seven years. During that period, he had been
part of America’s secret intelligence regime and held a clearance for
sensitive compartmented information, or SCI. Such SCI material is
considered so sensitive that it must be handled within formal access
control systems established by the director of national intelligence.
Nor did Snowden’s breach begin with his handing over classified
documents to the Guardian reporters in Hong Kong in June 2013 or,
for that matter, in the eleven days prior to his meeting with journal-
ists. He had, as the NSA quickly determined, begun illicitly copying
documents in the summer of 2012. Such a dangerous enterprise is
not born of a sudden impulse. It was, as his actions suggested, nur-
tured over many months. Even if he had managed to elude American
intelligence from late May to early June 2013, he could not hide all
the history that led to his decision to come to Hong Kong. There
® had to be an envelope of circumstances surrounding it, including ©
Snowden’s motivation, associates, movements, finances, and activi-
ties prior to his fleeing to Hong Kong. What was missing was not
just Snowden’s first eleven days in Hong Kong but the context of
the alleged crime.
I first needed to find out who Edward Snowden was.

He leaned over me. For the next three, keep your face down and your hands still,” he
said. Promise me.”

I can't, I said. I can't promise. I said it frantically. I was terrified of failing him. I
can't.”

You have to, he said gently. So you will.”

I cried harder. I sobbed so hard I couldn't speak. He stayed where he was, leaning over
me, and kept a merciless silence. I promise, I finally said, when I could shape words.
My back was to him, I couldn't see his face, but I swear I felt him smile.

When he hit me again, I barely moved. After the count of three, he said he wanted to see
how much longer I could go, but the answer was that I couldn't -- I started to flinch
strongly again. Of course, he kept hitting me, if only for that. But at least I hadn't broken
my promise. Hadn't failed him.

I've heard about a game in which the submissive partner stands next to a wall, and holds
two coins against the wall -- one in each hand. The dominant then does, you know, some
stuff. On the submissive's part, dropping the coins spells failure. This sounds pretty hot,
and it's one way to make a concrete predicament. But during the above encounter -- my
first time being flogged -- I assure you that it was plenty hot enough without any coins.
With only my promise and my awareness to keep me in line.

Sometimes I can't obey the order, no matter how hard I try. My partner may order me not
to move, for example, when I can't help moving. If I were in the above scenario, with the
coins, I'm not confident that I wouldn't drop them. It's scary -- especially if I love him,
because then all the emotions are multiplied. But even if I'm not in love -- as long as he's
got me in the right mental space, then if I fail, I will say I'm sorry” over and over. I'll be
terrified of his anger; I'll feel like I deserve punishment, and if he doesn't keep hurting me
I'll feel abandoned.

The more I fail, the more it hurts -- more than physical pain ever could. Slamming up
against my own limits makes me feel terribly inadequate. It's hot, but it's dangerous; it
can rip me apart. At times like that, I often need my partner to tell me after we're done: I
still like you and think you're a good person.”

And sometimes I need to hear that especially if I safeword out of the encounter, because
sometimes -- not always, but sometimes -- calling my safeword can feel like the worst
failure of all.

When I trace some of the weirdest and most random situations that get me hot, I see that
predicaments come up all the time. For example, I have a terrible tendency to try and
make out with a partner right before we're expected to be somewhere. I might be totally
cold 30 minutes before we have to leave, but 10 minutes before we have to leave, ding!
It's like a switch flips. We've got to leave, but I grab him and now he's turned on, oh no!

cine,” he said. “When you have too much it can be fatal.” Like Paul,
Snowden ardently opposed any form of gun control, as did Lindsay
Mills in her online postings.

Like other Libertarians, Snowden, a contractor for the government,
saw the government as an adversary. “The [American] government,”
he later said, “assumed upon itself, in secret, new executive powers
without any public awareness or any public consent and used them
against the citizenry of its own country to increase its own power,
to increase its own awareness.” Most relevant to his future activities
at the NSA, Snowden wholeheartedly agreed with Paul’s position
on the dangers inherent in government surveillance of U.S. citizens.
Paul described the CIA, the organization that had forced Snowden
out, as nothing short of a “secret government” and said that “in a
true Republic, there is no place for an organization like the CIA.” He
also railed against NSA surveillance.

As is clear from Snowden’s Internet postings, he, like Ron Paul,
had doubts about the competence of the intelligence agencies of the
U.S. government. Snowden’s own disillusionment about the govern-

© ment might have begun with his rejection and perceived mistreat- ©
ment by the Special Forces of the U.S. Army. It was almost certainly
reinforced by his ouster from the CIA. He later told The Guardian
that he was disillusioned as early as 2007 when he learned about the
CIA’s methods in compromising Swiss citizens. His critical view of
the U.S. government only hardened during the years he worked at
the NSA. He described his NSA superiors as “grossly incompetent,”
as he later explained to a journalist from Wired magazine in Mos-
cow. At the NSA, he said employees were kept in line by “fear and
a false image of patriotism.” He said that he saw his fellow workers
cowed into “obedience to authority” and his superiors induced to
break the law. He became particularly concerned with what he called
the “secret powers” of the NSA. He saw them as “tremendously
dangerous.” By this time, Snowden was fully aware that the NSA
conducted domestic surveillance because he had used his privileges
as a system administrator in 2012 to read the NSA inspector gen-
eral’s report on a 2009 surveillance program.

Nevertheless, Snowden continued to work at the NSA, where he
was, as he put it, “making a ton of money.” Mills joined him in his

after Epstein’s fiftieth birthday, she got a call out of the blue.

“He had a photo of us on the beach,” she says. “A friend

reactor near Baghdad, there was never any question that we would take any and all
possible measures to prevent Syria from getting a nuclear weapon. An immutable,
core assumption in Israel’s security strategy was the need to retain our ability to
deter, and if necessary defeat, our enemies. A nuclear Syria — or Iraq, or Iran —
would dramatically alter the balance of power in the region, at obvious risk to
Israel. Syria posed a particular threat, as part of an increasingly close alliance with
Iran, and with Hizbollah in Lebanon.

The question, however, was how and when to strike the reactor. Olmert wanted
to attack within days. He seemed to assume that, as a former chief of staff, ’'d nod
enthusiastically and go along with him. I did understand the reasons for his sense
of urgency. Not only did we have to make sure we attacked before the fuel was on
site. There was always the risk the Syrians would find out that we were aware of
their nuclear facility, putting them on even higher alert. But the operational
challenge was complex. We need a fail-safe plan to destroy the reactor. We had to
do it in such a way as to avoid a full-scale military confrontation with Syria if
possible. And we had to ensure we were ready for that, if it did happen. It took
very little time for me to realize that none of those prerequisites was yet in place.
Not unlike the recent Lebanon war, we were choosing between two off-the-shelf
plans from the kirya. One involved using a large military force, and would almost
certainly draw us into a major conflict with Syria. The other was a smaller,
targeted operation. But it remained untested, and there was no certainty it would
actually destroy the reactor.

Over the next few months, Olmert got more and more frustrated with the fact
we hadn’t yet attacked, and frustrated with me as well. We held dozens of
meetings, sometimes two or three a day, chaired by the Prime Minister, sometimes
by me as Defense Minister, or by the chief of staff or service commanders.
Invariably, I began my remarks by saying: “We have to destroy the reactor.” This
was not because I felt that any of us seriously doubted that. It was because Olmert
was beginning to suggest to the few ministers and senior officers aware of our
planning that I was against attacking the reactor. In fact, I was working with the
military and Mossad to ensure we had a plan that would succeed, with the
minimum possible risk of drawing us into a major clash with the Syrians after the
facility was destroyed. I was also working — with the help of the Americans — to
make sure we could get the forces and munitions in place in the north of Israel to

'Atlas Shrugged': From Fiction to Fact in 52 Years 
By STEPHEN MOORE 
Some years ago when I worked at the libertarian Cato Institute, we used to label any new hire who had not yet 
read Atlas Shrugged a virgin. Being conversant in Ayn Rand's classic novel about the economic carnage 
caused by big government run amok was practically a job requirement. If only Atlas were required reading for 
every member of Congress and political appointee in the Obama administration. I'm confident that we'd get out 
of the current financial mess a lot faster. 
The art for a 1999 postage stamp. 
Many of us who know Rand's work have noticed that with each passing week, and with each successive 
bailout plan and economic-stimulus scheme out of Washington, our current politicians are committing the very 
acts of economic lunacy that Atlas Shrugged parodied in 1957, when this 1,000-page novel was first 
published and became an instant hit. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030235 
Rand, who had come to America from Soviet Russia with striking insights into totalitarianism and the 
destructiveness of socialism, was already a celebrity. The left, naturally, hated her. But as recently as 1991, a 
survey by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club found that readers rated Atlas as the 
second-most influential book in their lives, behind only the Bible. 
For the uninitiated, the moral of the story is simply this: Politicians invariably respond to crises -- that in most 
cases they themselves created -- by spawning new government programs, laws and regulations. These, in 
turn, generate more havoc and poverty, which inspires the politicians to create more programs. .. and the 
downward spiral repeats itself until the productive sectors of the economy collapse under the collective weight 
of taxes and other burdens imposed in the name of fairness, equality and do-goodism. 
In the book, these relentless wealth redistributionists and their programs are disparaged as the looters and 
their laws. Every new act of government futility and stupidity carries with it a benevolent-sounding title. These 
include the Anti-Greed Act to redistribute income (sounds like Charlie Rangel's promises soak-the-rich tax 
bill) and the Equalization of Opportunity Act to prevent people from starting more than one business (to give 
other people a chance). My personal favorite, the Anti Dog-Eat-Dog Act, aims to restrict cut-throat 
competition between firms and thus slow the wave of business bankruptcies. Why didn't Hank Paulson think of 
that? 
These acts and edicts sound farcical, yes, but no more so than the actual events in Washington, circa 2008. 
We already have been served up the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and the Auto 
Industry Financing and Restructuring Act. Now that Barack Obama is in town, he will soon sign into law with 
great urgency the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan. This latest Hail Mary pass will increase the 
federal budget (which has already expanded by $1.5 trillion in eight years under George Bush) by an additional 
$1 trillion -- in roughly his first 100 days in office. 
The current economic strategy is right out of Atlas Shrugged: The more incompetent you are in business, the 
more handouts the politicians will bestow on you. That's the justification for the $2 trillion of subsidies doled out 
already to keep afloat distressed insurance companies, banks, Wall Street investment houses, and auto 
companies -- while standing next in line for their share of the booty are real-estate developers, the steel 
industry, chemical companies, airlines, ethanol producers, construction firms and even catfish farmers. With 
each successive bailout to calm the markets, another trillion of national wealth is subsequently lost. Yet, as 
Atlas grimly foretold, we now treat the incompetent who wreck their companies as victims, while those 
resourceful business owners who manage to make a profit are portrayed as recipients of illegitimate 
windfalls. 
When Rand was writing in the 1950s, one of the pillars of American industrial might was the railroads. In her 
novel the railroad owner, Dagny Taggart, an enterprising industrialist, has a FedEx-like vision for expansion 
and first-rate service by rail. But she is continuously badgered, cajoled, taxed, ruled and regulated -- always in 
the public interest -- into bankruptcy. Sound far-fetched? On the day I sat down to write this ode to Atlas, a 
Wall Street Journal headline blared: Rail Shippers Ask Congress to Regulate Freight Prices. 
In one chapter of the book, an entrepreneur invents a new miracle metal -- stronger but lighter than steel. The 
government immediately appropriates the invention in the public good. The politicians demand that the metal 
inventor come to Washington and sign over ownership of his invention or lose everything. 
The scene is eerily similar to an event late last year when six bank presidents were summoned by Treasury 
Secretary Hank Paulson to Washington, and then shuttled into a conference room and told, in effect, that they 
could not leave until they collectively signed a document handing over percentages of their future profits to the 
government. The Treasury folks insisted that this shakedown, too, was all in the public interest. 
Ultimately, Atlas Shrugged is a celebration of the entrepreneur, the risk taker and the cultivator of wealth 
through human intellect. Critics dismissed the novel as simple-minded, and even some of Rand's political 
admirers complained that she lacked compassion. Yet one pertinent warning resounds throughout the book: 
When profits and wealth and creativity are denigrated in society, they start to disappear -- leaving everyone the 
poorer. 
One memorable moment in Atlas occurs near the very end, when the economy has been rendered comatose 
by all the great economic minds in Washington. Finally, and out of desperation, the politicians come to the 
heroic businessman John Galt (who has resisted their assault on capitalism) and beg him to help them get the 
economy back on track. The discussion sounds much like what would happen today: 
Galt: You want me to be Economic Dictator? 
Mr. Thompson: Yes! 
And you'll obey any order I give? 
Implicitly! 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030236 
Then start by abolishing all income taxes. 
Oh no! screamed Mr. Thompson, leaping to his feet. We couldn't do that . . . How would we pay government 
employees? 
Fire your government employees. 
Oh, no! 
Abolishing the income tax. Now that really would be a genuine economic stimulus. But Mr. Obama and the 
Democrats in Washington want to do the opposite: to raise the income tax for purposes of fairness as Barack 
Obama puts it. 
David Kelley, the president of the Atlas Society, which is dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas, explains that 
the older the book gets, the more timely its message. He tells me that there are plans to make Atlas 
Shrugged into a major motion picture -- it is the only classic novel of recent decades that was never made into 
a movie. We don't need to make a movie out of the book, Mr. Kelley jokes. We are living it right now.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026525.txt,"Similarly, a strategy for player 2 dictates whether he will continue or exit as a function
of everything player 1 has done in the past. One relatively simple strategy for player 2
is to continue so long as player 1 has cooperated. If both players play according to this
pair of strategies, each time the temptation is low, player 1 cooperates and gets a, player
2 gets b, and the game continues with probability w until the first time the temptation
is high. Then, player 1 defects and gets c, and player 2 gets d. Some straightforward
calculations yield the players’ expected payoffs: player 1’s is [ap + c,(1 — p)] / [1 — pw]
and player 2’s is [bp + d(1 — p)| / [1 — pw]. Because a strategy specifies players’ moves in
every period and the game’s length is undetermined, infinitely many possible strategies
exist. We are primarily interested in the seven strategies represented in Figure 2, which
shows the expected payoff for each player for each strategy pair of interest.

Of particular interest is the strategy pair designated in the top left corner of figure 2),
in which player 2 discriminates between cooperators who look and those who do not
look, and player 1 cooperates without looking (CWOL). The following simple argument
demonstrates that this strategy pair is a Nash Equilibrium (which means no player has
an incentive to unilaterally deviate) whenever ~*~ > qp+cp(1—p). This condition has a
natural interpretation: player 1’s expected temptation from defection is less than the gains
from an ongoing cooperative interaction. Thus, player 1 would lose from deviating, for

example by looking, because this would end the lucrative ongoing relationship, reducing

a
Le

player 1’s payoff from an expected to 0. Player 2 would also lose from deviating, by
choosing to exit, because when player 1 is always cooperating, she expects oo from the
relationship, and exiting yields 0.

One potential concern with this equilibrium is that, since player 2 is not worse off by

not attending to looking, he might not do so. This turns out to not be the case. The

intuition is that if there is even a small probability player 1 looks, player 2 is better off

on August 20, 1975. “At the time, we thought this was humorous. I took a photo of Mary (their sister) and Mary took a

enforcement can learn of misconduct done mostly in secret, political or personal incentives for enforcement officials that
discourage zealous enforcement can exist for enforcement officials in the same jurisdiction - perhaps enmeshed in the same
political networks. In short, underenforcement in this realm follows more from favoritism toward offenders than the biases
against victim groups or types of offenses.

Corruption is a notoriously hard concept to define, '*° but that difficulty is actually somewhat useful for present purposes.
Some of what constitutes public corruption is relatively clearly [*892] defined in positive law. Easy cases involve
straightforward property theft or embezzlement, quid pro quo bribery, and extortion. '*! Statutes also make clear at least some
cases of illegal gratuities and breaches of regulations that govern activities such as campaign finance. '** More ambiguous or
marginal cases of alleged corruption, however, illustrate the federal government's ambitious commitment to enforcing broad
interpretations of federal anti-corruption laws to conduct of state and local officials. That enforcement track record
demonstrates the strong commitment to enforcement redundancy in this area.

States have their own regulatory strategies to address government corruption, although independent assessments do not judge
them to be particularly successful. '°? The federal government seems to share that view. The Justice Department created a

Public Integrity Section within the Criminal Division in 1976, !>4

and in the four decades since, federal prosecutors have
[*893] aggressively prosecuted conduct of state and local officials that it determines breaches federal anti-corruption statutes.
'S> For the past two decades, federal anti-corruption prosecutions of state and local officials typically average 350-400 per year.
156 Combatting public corruption is a top priority for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on par with combating threats of
terrorism, foreign espionage, and cyber-warfare. '*7 And many of these prosecutions targeted wrongdoing far removed from
property theft or quid pro quo bribery. !°8 They extend to conduct involving undue influence, breaches of fiduciary duty, or

failure to provide citizens with honest services 1°?

160

- wrongdoing for which the public harm is sometimes hard to identify.

[#894] By some accounts, including the U.S. Supreme Court's on occasion, 1°!

this enforcement agenda has been overly
aggressive. '°? But Congress has generally encouraged far-reaching federal enforcement, notably by expanding the scope of

federal anti-corruption law in response to narrow judicial interpretation. !®? And the key point here is that the federal executive

Heuristics Hypothesis, our model also predicts that decisions related to cooperation are
more likely to be intuitive than other decisions that are similarly usually worthwhile, and
that intuitive cooperators are trusted more than reflective cooperators. To our knowledge,
neither of these predictions has been tested yet.

People dislike considering trade-offs related to “sacred values” [29]. Sacred values
are values such as love, liberty, honor, justice, or life, that people treat “as possessing
transcendental significance that precludes comparisons, trade-offs, or indeed any mingling
with secular values” [29]. While there is variation in what societies consider sacred,
virtually all societies have a concept of sacredness [29]. Sacred values are so strongly
imbued in us that we do not find them puzzling prima fascia, yet their existence and
origin remains poorly understood. What makes us treat some values as sacred and what
differentiates these values from secular values like free time or money that we more readily
trade off?

Our model provides one possible explanation. People who calculate costs of trading
off against sacred values are less trustworthy when it comes to safeguarding these values
than people who consider them sacred and would never calculate the costs of trading
off against them. Responding with disgust to these “taboo trade-offs” may be one way
to prevent us from interacting with people who make such trade offs and hence are less
trustworthy, and may also be a way to signal to others that we ourselves would not
consider, and therefore make, such trade-offs. Consistent with CWOL, it is taboo to
consider the trade-off even if one ultimately makes the right choice, and the longer the
trade-off is considered for, the harsher the judgement by observers [29]. As with intuitive
cooperation, if people who refuse to consider taboo trade-offs are seen as more trustworthy,

this may lead people to evolve or learn to abide by these taboos. If CWOL indeed underlies

The Palm Beach finance crowd can paddleboard whenever they please.

Behind a semicircular brick drive and a lawn as manicured as a putting
green sits a 30,000-square-foot masterpiece of Italian Renaissance
architecture called Casa Nana.

John Porter, a real estate associate for Corcoran who oversees some of the
largest sales in Palm Beach County, Florida, points out the spiral staircase,
built by famed 1920s architect Addison Mizner for the founder of the
National Tea Company. “This home went for $30.2 million in 2003; today
that sum wouldn’t be in the top 25 highest prices” of houses for sale in this
area, Porter says. “Palm Beach real estate has gone from nothing going on to
nothing left to sell.”

Porter is giving me a tour of the so-called Billionaire’s Row, a stretch of
South Ocean Boulevard on the island of Palm Beach that is bordered by
some of the highest hedges I’ve ever seen. Through gaps in the greenery
appear stone fountains, elephant statues, pools the size of tennis complexes
(next to actual tennis complexes), and more clay roofs than one could count.
It’s amonumental display of wealth, and it is rapidly expanding, not just
here but in Delray Beach, Jupiter, Palm Beach Gardens and Boca Raton, as

Nikkei to 20,000: Inventory cycle upturn —> cyclicals;  
inflation —> banks, insurance  
Investment Strategy 
18 November 2016 
Key takeaways 
• Solid macro and weaker JPY positive for Japan equities, which also tend to outperform when 
US rate rises (esp. steepening) 
• The inventory cycle continues to recover on fiscal easing and capex, implying cyclical stocks 
will outperform 
• Inflation and higher yields positive for banks, insurance. Risk is diplomacy, protectionism, and 
US economic cycle 
FULL REPORT 
Bullish equities 2017; rotation into cyclicals, banks, insurance 
We are bullish Japan equities for 2017 and we estimate the Nikkei 225 index will recover to 20,000 by end-
2017 (see $/¥'s eventual surge: Buy Nikkei 06 September 2016). Our new Chief Japan Economist lzumi 
Devalier forecasts above-consensus Japan GDP growth and inflation in 2017, which is also supportive of our 
bullish equities scenario (see 4.eady for ignition 18 November 2016). We expect rotation into cyclicals, banks 
and insurance as explained below. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 014399 
1) Upturn in inventory cycle: Defensives—>Cyclicals 
We expect cyclicals to outperform defensives, premised on our end-2017 $114 estimate of ¥120, and this is 
supported by our above-consensus economic growth outlook. Our Japan economist sees a shift to fiscal 
easing, firms countering the tight labor market by increasing capex, and estimates industrial production to grow 
3.5% and 3.6% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. With the inventory cycle exiting a contraction phase and 
entering a recovery phase, conditions are likely to remain conducive to cyclicals outperforming defensives 
(Chart 1, Exhibit 3). 
2) Higher inflation, rates: Deflation stocks—>lnflation stocks 
Up to 1H16, the Japan equity market saw continued preference for deflationary stocks as domestic inflation 
remained subdued and the JGB curve underwent excessive bull flattening. Defensives outperformed cyclicals 
(Chart 1), growth outperformed value (Chart 2), and stocks that benefit from a low-yield environment (REITs) 
outperformed the converse (banks, insurance; Chart 3). However, we expect conditions to reverse into 2017. 
We see US Treasury yields rising and Japanese core CPI inflation recovering to +1.4% yoy by 2018 and core-
core to +1.1% yoy. Stronger inflation and higher foreign yields should steepen the JGB yield curve above10yr, 
while below 10yr should escape from downward pressure as BoJ rate cut expectations recede. Against this 
backdrop, we expect to see a rotation from deflation to inflation stocks, which in addition to cyclicals means 
banks and insurance should outperform REITs within the financial sector (Chart 3). This is also in line with the 
global rotation expected by Michael Hartnett (The Flow Show: The inflation Era Begins 10 Noverriper 2016). 
3) Nikkei winner of steeper UST and strong macro 
In a scenario of strong external demand and US rate hikes (particularly with curve steepening), Japan equities 
tend to be the winner on a local currency basis, led by cyclicals, banks and insurance stocks (Exhibit 4). 
Resurgence in the Japan macro trade of short yen / buy equities is also a possibility. 
Our Buy-rated stocks in bank, insurance and cyclical sectors are listed in Table 1.

Ready for ignition  
18 November 2016 
Key takeaways 
• We are upbeat on Japan's outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength of 
medium-term GDP and inflation. 
• While the consensus looks for just 0.8% growth next year, we expect growth of 1.4% in 
CY17 and 1.2% in CY18. 
• With inflation moving in the right direction, we expect BoJ to keep its rates targets 
unchanged for the foreseeable future. 
WATCH THE VIDEO  
FULL REPORT 
Consensus underestimating GDP and inflation 
We are upbeat on Japan's outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength of medium-term GDP 
and inflation. We expect growth of 1.4% in CY2017 and 1.2% in CY2018, well above consensus of just 0.8% 
growth next year. For the first time in four years both monetary and fiscal policy are supporting growth. The 
combination of modestly higher commodity prices, a weaker yen, and a tightening output gap should drive 
Japan-style core inflation to 1.0% in CY2017, and 1.4% in CY2018. We expect the BoJ to keep its rate targets 
unchanged for the foreseeable future as inflation moves in the right direction. 
Fiscal and monetary policy realigning 
For years Japan has oscillated between loose and tight fiscal policy. Japanese policymakers now seem to be 
on the same page and we see little risk of another policy error. If anything, we see upside risks from greater 
fiscal stimulus via a third supplementary budget or a relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget. Meanwhile, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 014401 
the BoJ's new interest-pegging regime ensures that financial conditions will become increasingly stimulatory 
as inflation rises. 
2017 - a year of recovering domestic demand 
We think the economy is heading towards a cyclical sweet spot and see a broad-based recovery in domestic 
demand. Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the saving rate peaks; 2) capex should 
accelerate in response to the improving demand outlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and low-for-
longer real rates; and 3) increased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up 
the velocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy. 
Biggest risk factor: US policy uncertainty 
External developments pose the greatest risk to our forecasts, chief among them US policy uncertainty. The 
downside scenario for Japan is a combination of rising US protectionism, sliding global trade, and a stronger 
yen, which could reduce 2017 growth to zero. The Trump presidency may increase pressure on Japan to 
achieve greater military self-reliance, boosting defense spending. There will also be greater incentives to 
deepen economic and trade linkages with key regional players, such as China and Russia.

e Dershowitz would have been defending Epstein at the time of the alleged sexual
encounter, having been hired to work on the case in 2005 when a number of underage
girls began coming forward and telling police they were paid to have sex.

e This makes the second woman to allege that she had sex with Dershowitz at the
behest of Epstein.

These allegations mean and would be understood to mean that:

e Mr Epstein directed] to have sex with our client;

e Our client had encouraged Mr Epstein to direct in this way;

e Ms Ransome alleged that our client had sex with her;

e Our client did in fact have sex wit

prostitution;

« Our client was in some way involved in Mr Epstein's soliciting of children for
prostitution;

« Our client's behaviour was improper and in breach of his professional obligations
and the law; and

e Our client is a sexual predator and/or a paedophile.
The facts

“A GOOD APPETITE; SEAFOOD, EASY AND GUILT-FREE” (New York Times).

It is perhaps unsurprising that a set of tools has emerged to assuage this guilt and, in the
case of seafood, reform the appetite.” These tools aim to divert demand from one type of seafood
toward another. Wallet cards, iPhone apps, and eco-labels tell consumers which fish ought to be
and ought not to be eaten. Shoppers in Europe have been given rulers, so that they can measure
fish and avoid buying juveniles.

Guilt abounds in many situations where conservation is an issue, not just in the response
to overfishing. Harried by guilt, one mother reuses her daughter’s bathwater for her own bath.
Los Angeles shoppers refuse to buy blueberries imported from Chile, because of the fuel
consumed in shipping them. Another woman feels guilty about the natural habitat lost to cocoa
cultivation and refuses to buy chocolate, prompting her husband to say that she took the joy out
of his Almond Joy.® Just as the devout purchased guilt-alleviating papal indulgences in the

and can be guided to something approaching sanctimony by books like The Virtuous Consumer,
The Rough Guide to Shopping with a Conscience, and The Eco Chick Guide to Life: How to Be

The problem is that environmental guilt, while it may well lead to conspicuous

103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *862

Under the criminal justice systems of all other major common law countries and nearly all European states, victims’ rights also
include authority to challenge prosecutors’ decisions not to prosecute, either by a limited right to initiate prosecutions as private
parties or by enabling victims to trigger judicial or [*863] administrative review of noncharging decisions. °* By contrast,
nearly every U.S. jurisdiction rejects these mechanisms. State and federal laws consistently avoid permitting victims any power
to challenge or encroach on public prosecutorial authority. Federal law, for example, explicitly dictates that nothing im this
[victims' rights] chapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under
his direction. ©? State statutes manifest the same policy in various ways, such as by prohibiting legal remedies for violations
of participation rights they create. °+ U.S. laws limit victims’ participation to non-dispositive forms, such as providing
information and personal statements to prosecutors, judges, and parole boards, which facilitates victims’ influence on public
officials' decisionmaking. ® But state and federal policy rejects enlisting victims as agents of accountability for public
prosecution. °°

In U.S. jurisdictions and elsewhere, the conceptual innovation of victims' rights laws was to recognize victims’ distinct private
[*864] interests in public criminal litigation. Most rights are specific entitlements to advance victims' broader, dignitary right
to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity. ©” These provisions conceive of victims as agents of
individual rights and independent from systemic interests, and their interests can either conflict or align with those of law
enforcement. ° At the same time, victim participation rights can also be understood to serve a broader public interest in
procedural outcomes, on the premise, for example, that prosecutors’ and judges’ decisions will improve with direct input from
victims. Public decisionmaking risks substantive deficiency, and criminal process would be procedurally deficient, without due
regard for victims’ interests. Jurisdictions that empower victims to challenge non-prosecution decisions enable private parties
themselves to address the problem of criminal law underenforcement. The remainder of this Section provides some detail on
contemporary forms of private prosecution authority, their capacity to advance public as well as private interests, and reasons
for its absence (or demise) in U.S. jurisdictions.

Fig. 16.2: Part 2 of a Piagetan conservation of volume experiment: a child observes two different-
shaped glasses, which (depending on the level of his cognition), he may be able to infer have
the same amount of milk in them, due to the events depicted in Figure 16.1.

16.6.1 Integrating Virtual Worlds with Robot Simulators

One glaring deficit in current virtual world platforms is the lack of flexibility in terms of tool use.
In most of these systems today, an avatar can pick up or utilize an object, or two objects can
interact, only in specific, pre-programmed ways. For instance, an avatar might be able to pick up
a virtual screwdriver only by the handle, rather than by pinching the blade betwen its fingers.
This places severe limits on creative use of tools, which is absolutely critical in a preschool
context. The solution to this problem is clear: adapt existing generalized physics engines to
mediate avatar-object and object-object interactions. This would require more computation
than current approaches, but not more than is feasible in a research context.

One way to achieve this goal would be to integrate a robot simulator with a virtual world
or game engine, for instance to modify the OpenSim (opensimulator.org) virtual world to
use the Gazebo (playerstage.sourceforge.net) robot simulator in place of its current
physics engine. While tractable, such a project would require considerable software engineering
effort.

16.6.2 BlocksNBeads World

Another glaring deficit in current virtual world platforms is their inability to model physical
phenomena besides rigid objects with any sophistication. In this section we propose a potential

points. It would amount to retaining control over around 20 percent of the West
Bank, but none of the major Arab towns or cities. Though deliberately stopping
well short of share of the West Bank Arafat could have secured through a
negotiated peace, it would remove Israeli troops and settlers from most of the
territory. It would give the Palestinians ample room to set up a state if they so
chose, and conceivably to expand its area if some future leader had more of the
“Ben-Gurion” in him than Arafat. Until then, it would allow both of our peoples to
get on with their lives and focus on their own political and social and economic
challenges.

There was a second, critically important part to what I was proposing: the
construction of a physical security fence along the new “disengagement line” with
the West Bank. It was the suggestion rejected under Rabin, accepted under Peres
amid the Hamas bombings in the 1996 election campaign, but never followed
through on. Even under the new arrangement I envisaged, Israeli troops would
retain the freedom of action to respond to, or pre-empt, terror attacks with targeted
operations inside the West Bank. But the physical barrier would hugely increase
our ability to halt the attackers before they could strike.

Yet even if I’d been able to bring those on the left of Labor behind the plan, this
election campaign was going to be a lot tougher than in 1999. Since Knesset
members weren’t running for their seats, the Labor machine lacked its usual
incentive put up posters, knock on doors, or get out the vote. Arik, however,
benefited from the enthusiasm of Likudniks and other right-wing activists who saw
an opportunity to retake control of Israel’s political agenda.

Long before election day, I realized my time as Prime Minister was up. Before
the campaign began, an old friend of mine, a leading Israeli journalist, tried to talk
me into withdrawing. “You’re going to lose, Ehud,” he said. “Why, after making
all this effort for peace, after doing your best, do you want the last act to be losing
to Arik?” I'd never seen the objective as just staying in office. If that had been the
case, I wouldn’t have put the chances of a peace deal with Syria to their final test. I
wouldn’t have gone to Camp David. I also would have accepted Arik’s serial
offers to join a unity coalition. But never in my life had I walked away from a
challenge. I certainly wasn’t going to retreat in the midst of Palestinian violence,
and when Israel still faced key decisions on how to move on from Arafat’s
unreadiness to negotiate an end to our decades-old conflict.

cebo effect.”

he headquarters of the Food and
Drug Administration, situated on
a campus called White Oak, on the far
edge of Silver Spring, Maryland, seems
as close to the rest of the federal medi-
cal establishment as it is to Pluto. There
is no Metro to White Oak, and it takes
half an hour to drive from the sprawling
campus to the National Institutes of
Health, in Bethesda. The F.D.A.’s
physical isolation belies its position as
the nation’s principal regulator of con-
sumer products. No drug is sold with-
out the agency’s approval. There will be
no prescriptions for any placebo, either,
unless clinical trials have demonstrated
its effectiveness to the satisfaction of
the F.D.A.
“One of the absolutely fundamental
problems that we have is the use of the

34 THE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 2011

term ‘placebo, which does nobody any
good,” Robert Temple told me, echoing
a complaint made by virtually every-
one who deals with the subject. Temple,
who has for many years run the F.D.A’s
drug-evaluation department, is an owlish
man with a short, thick mustache and cir-
cular glasses. His office is so filled with
towering stacks of files that, after you
enter, it takes a moment to find him. “Just
because something is called a ‘placebo
eroup, ” he said, “everyone assumes that
what happens in that group is a result of
the placebo effect. And that is absolutely
not true.”

Temple, who has worked at the
F.D.A. for four decades, rarely makes a
decision without angering somebody. He
has been regarded as a meddlesome reac-
tionary by H.1.V. activists and others
who insist that drugs be released more
rapidly. The more conservative medical
establishment frequently accuses the
agency of endorsing the wishful thinking
of drug manufacturers. And to the large
and growing community that supports
alternative approaches to medicine Tem-
ple is Dr. No.

Temple said that he understands why
placebos attract people who become frus-
trated when science fails to provide
definitive answers. “The persistence of
what people believe will save their lives as
opposed to the evidence is staggering,” he
said. “So people are talking about using

placebos as drugs. But I have no idea what
that means in practical terms. How would
it work?” Tantalizing hints and possible
effects are not data, and Temple says there
are no data that would suggest that place-
bos are drugs. There are several studies,
though, that illustrate the basis for his
skepticism.

A placebo effect is commonly ob-
served during trials of blood-pressure
medications. To qualify for such studies,
subjects are supposed to have blood pres-
sure that exceeds a hundred and forty
over ninety in at least one of the two
measurements. “As soon as somebody
enters those studies, his or her blood
pressure falls an average of five or six mil-
limetres of mercury,” Temple said. “That
is significant, but it is not a placebo re-
sponse, and it is not a response to being
in the study. It is often the result of doc-
tors’ inflating readings—of rounding up.”
Ifa person's blood pressure is a hundred
and thirty-eight over eighty-eight, for ex-
ample, investigators will often include
him. “When you use an automatic blood-
pressure cuff to establish a baseline for
these kinds of studies, the entire placebo
effect vanishes,” Temple said.

When a drug (or a placebo) is under
study, subjects are usually divided into two
groups. Neither group knows exactly what
it is getting (nor do the doctors), but one
group generally receives the drug and the
other a placebo. “There is a better way,”
Temple said. “If you want to see if there is
a placebo effect, use three arms in a drug
trial, not two. Tell them, ‘Some of you will
be getting a drug, some will get a tablet
that looks like a drug but is nothing but a
sugar pill, and some of you will get noth-
ing at all’

“It seems to me,” he went on, “that if
there is any substantial placebo effect,
there ought to be a difference between the
group that knows it’s getting nothing and
the group that doesn’t know it’s getting
nothing. If there is no difference, then
what are we talking about? Because it’s
not a placebo effect.”

It turns out that there have been many
trials of the type Temple mentioned. In
2001, the Danish epidemiologist As-
bjorn Hrébjartsson, of Copenhagen’s
Nordic Cochrane Center, along with his
colleague Peter Getzsche, published a
systematic review of a hundred and four-
teen clinical trials that compared patients
who received a placebo with subjects who

connection with at all. So I try not to see them unless I feel inoculated: I don't hang out
with them unless I'm sure I can distract myself with my feelings about another man.

A lot of polyamorists say that love is infinite,” that we can love lots of people, etc. I
agree with this in theory -- but there's also a polyamorous saying that While love may be
infinite, time is not. And hormones aren't infinite, either. I've learned my hormonal
reactions, I've seen myself get imprinted by people... I've seen myself develop feelings
and fantasies for one guy that made me 100% immune to another hot guy's charms.

Do I have perfect self-control? Absolutely not. That's why I'm trying to influence my own
choices so carefully. I know that choice plays a huge role when we build relationships.
Choosing to commit is arguably as big a relationship factor as instinctive chemistry.

... Arguably.

When I first got to college many moons ago, my roommate came from a family of
immigrants with a tradition of arranged marriages. She and I stayed up late one night,
perched on our dorm room mattresses, and I listened in fascination while she told me that
her father wanted her to marry a man of her father's choice, rather than her own.

I'm not sure whether I'll do it, she said. I watched her wave a hand airily. I was
mesmerized by her casual acceptance of a custom that struck me as barbaric. I mean,
she said, I'm cool with this guy that my dad's found for me. But I don't know if we're
that cool. On the other hand, I can't deny the advantages of arranged marriages.”

Advantages! I cried. I was so young... (Okay, I'm still young.) What do you mean,
advantages?!

Arranged marriages are more stable, she said. Much more stable. I'm not sure I'd ever
want to marry for love. That shit goes up in smoke.”

From what I understand, there have even been studies about this: that people in arranged
marriages report being quite happy, quite stable.

I've gotten the it's-not-passion-that-makes-a-successful-marriage message before, of
course -- often from super-white, super-American Americans. For example, there's that
infamous 2008 article Marry Him: The Case For Settling For Mr. Good Enough. The
article is sure to send any woman roughly my age into a panic. It's made enough of an
impression that I still have conversations about it with other women my age -- almost
four years after its debut.

I don't like the Settling writer's attitude. She's written with horror and anger about S&M
in other venues, for example; and the whole Settling article has a generally conservative
bent. But she's articulating some real feelings and important thoughts, and while I don't
agree with all of them, I do agree with some. At one point, analyzing television, she notes
that:

While Rachel and her supposed soul mate, Ross, finally get together (for the umpteenth
time) in the finale of Friends, do we feel confident that she'll be happier with Ross than

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013571.txt,"enormously rich and logically consistent intellectual framework from within which to
characterize macroscopic behavior composed of unknown molecular mechanisms.
Ideas about entropy grew out of William Thomson's (a.k.a Lord Kelvin)
thermodynamic laws about energy conservation and its allowable transformations.
Later Clausius decomposed the energy into that which was available for mechanical
work, called work-content, and that which was not, called transformation content.
He referred to the transformation content, a reflection of what changes in the
internal order properties of the system that occurred as a concomitant of changes in
energy and heat, as the entropy.

Rudolph Clausius added the word entropy as a thermodynamic property to
the conceptual armamentarium of theoretical physics in about 1865. This followed
the earlier work of the French engineer, Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot, who was
trying to develop a theoretical framework within which efficiencies in heat-

generating engines might be understood. It implicated positive, > 0, changes, d, in
entropy, S, with changes in time, ¢, .e. “ > 0, entropy is increasing in time, as a

concomitant of the inevitable mechanical inefficiencies in an energy driven system.
The resulting losses in the form of wasted energy show up as increases in
molecular motion, which could be estimated from the increases in heat. Wasted
energy dissipated as heat increases the amount of random motion and volume
occupied by the surrounding molecules in physical processes involving heat,
pressure, vaporization, condensation and work; all elements of that era’s dominant

physical metaphor, the steam engine.

The highly developed, multifaceted, often quite abstract formal
characteristics of the inferred property, entropy, prevent glib definitions and
generalizations. In the context of Kelvin-Clausius theory, the entropy of a closed
system will remain the same if it is isolated from any matter or energy exchanges
with the environment. If heating a system such that the change, d, in heat, Q, is
positive, i.e. dQ > 0, it experiences a rearrangement in its microstructural motions,
but the temperature is left unchanged. The (inferred) entropy, S, increases (i.e., dS

> Q) as the ratio of change in added heat, dQ, over the unchanging, absolute

Chapter 4: Beginning my life as an academic—and its changes over time

I moved to Cambridge with my wife and two sons during the late summer of 1964. We rented an
apartment, first in Brookline and a year later in Cambridge.

I began my teaching career at Harvard at the age of 25. Some of my students were older than I
was, and a lot more experienced. I was called the “Boy Professor.” It was intimidating and

scary.

Preparing for classes that I had never before taught was a full time job. When I began teaching in
1964, the two “best” teachers were reputed to be Clark Byse and Ben Kaplan. I wanted to learn
from the best, so I asked them if I could sit in on some of their classes to observe their teaching
techniques and styles. They both refused. Professor Kaplan asked me, rhetorically, whether I
“allowed people to watch while you make love with your wife?” I replied, “of course not.” He
smiled and said “well, I make love with my students and don’t want anyone watching.” I was
tempted to respond that if I had 160 wives and made love to them all at once, I wouldn’t even
notice if people watched, but I accepted his rebuke and had to figure out how to teach based on
trial and error. There were no classes at Yale Law School on how to teach law—and no
instruction books. For the first several years I did nothing but teach and write. It was a full time
job, and I had no time for cases or other outside activities. That was soon to change, but not until
after I learned how to be a professor.

My first assignment was to teach the required first year course in criminal law. On my first day of
teaching, I encountered 160 eager faces. The men were dressed in shirts and ties; the handful of
women wore skirts. The teaching style of the day was Socratic, with the teacher posing difficult
hypothetical questions based on cases the students were assigned from a case book. The
“Socratic Method” came naturally to me because of my Talmudic background and argumentative
nature. Right from the beginning I sensed that the traditional case books did not give the students
an appropriate balance between the theory of law and its real world practice. I decided to write
my own case book, along with my criminal law mentor at Yale, Joseph Goldstein. I also decided
to supplement my case book on a weekly basis with materials about contemporaneous
developments in the law. My goal was to keep the students current while also preparing them to
practice, teach, judge or legislate about criminal issues until the end of their careers a half century
hence. I also wanted to introduce my students to other disciplines—psychology, sociology,
economics, biology, literature—that would enrich their lives as lawyers. It was a daunting task,
but one that I approached with enthusiasm and eagerness. I rejected any sharp distinction
between “theoretical” and “practical” approaches to teaching, believing that theory must be tested
by practice, and that practice should be informed by theory. To this day, I bring my practice into
the classroom and my theory into the courtroom.

I immediately loved teaching, particularly the Socratic exchange with my students. But I noticed
that even though several of my students were older than me (William Bennett was among them),
many of them were intimidated by the fact that I was the Professor. The “Paper Chase”
professors were still the rule at Harvard and students were terrified of making a mistake. I
wanted very much to loosen up the students and so I decided on a ploy. About a month into the

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018280.txt,"we consider what not to do. The first approach proposes something known
appealingly enough as “Smart Power.”5” The concept was summarized most sharply
by President Obama in 2014, when he said American policy ought best be guided by
this tight precept: “Don’t do stupid stuff.5®” And while it is hard to disagree with this
sort of charming, solipsistic formulation — there’s not a long list of politicians
supporting a strategy of “Do stupid things”? - “Smart Power” is no more a foreign
policy vision than “Good Weather’ is a strategy for farming. It suggests in some way
there is no need for a strategy at all. Faced with a problem, just make a smart
decision. “I don't really even need George Kennan right now,” Obama remarked at
one point during his presidency, dismissing the need for a strategist of real stature -
and, by implication, the need for any strategy at all.5°

Such a stance reflects an instinct that the great strategic question of our day — the
future — has pretty well been worked out. In such a view of history, all we need to do
is not screw this up too much. The root of this idea is an absence of a long view of
history and a discomfort I think about the application of cold power. There’s a
misplaced confidence at work here, an assurance that American-style power, our
model of politics and economics, is the best, final and only answer to the question of
how the nations of the world might be best organized. Americans need, in this
telling of history, only patience. The world will catch on. And | suppose that if you
grew up in the United States after World War Two, such a vision of the world
certainly would be consistent with your own experience. The problem is that sucha
comfortable posture is at odds with nearly any book of history you might pick up,
from The Peloponnesian Wars to Churchill's The Hinge of Fate, all of which will
remind you in the most violent terms that liberty and freedom demand struggle and
defense; that epochal changes come whether we want them or not. Also that nations
that look invincible can find themselves nearly unwound in an historical instant.
Great Britain mastered the globe in 1937; three years later she was gasping for air;
three decades later she was an afterthought. “Freedom is the sure possession of
those alone who have the courage to defend it,” Pericles told his Athenian audience
nearly 2500 years ago in as they mourned a full year of war-dead sons and fathers -—
and no peace yet in sight. Or, Churchill, famously: “Never, never, never, never give
up.”6! We should be embarrassed to hold “Don’t do stupid things” against these
mottos.

Admiral Hyman Rickover’s famous advice as he surveyed the nuclear navy he’d built
in the last century has it about right at every level: “To find meaning in life one must

Gross output is gross realized output plus unrealized (or proprietary or self-

invested) output. This can show as

gross

Think of the subscript s as meaning saved or self-invested. As all output is either

realized or unrealized, we have
Y=Y+Y..

The terms saved, self-invested, unrealized and proprietary will be taken as

interchangeable.

“T don’t know him, but I know someone who does,” he answered. “Why are you interested
in seeing Kucherena?”

I told him that I wanted to speak to him about Snowden but that I had been unable to arrange
a meeting.

“That’s no problem,” he said, raising his cell phone (which never left his hand.) He hit a number
the speed dial, and spoke rapidly in Russian (which I do not understand.) He cupped his hand
over the phone and asked how long I would be in Moscow.

After I told him that I was leaving on Friday, he spoke again in to the person on the other end.
“You will have an appointment on Thursday,” he said.

Later that afternoon Valentina, Kucherena’s assistant, called to say that Kucherena would be
happy to see me at his office at 6 PM on Thursday. I didn’t ask Lugovoy who he had called or
how this had happened. Clearly, whoever Lugovoy called had the power to arrange the meeting.
Power evidently works in unseen ways in Putin’s Russia.

Kucherena’s office was only two subway stops from the National hotel, and I arrived ten
minutes early. A receptionist showed me into a well-lit square room with an elegant table in the
center. There was a sumptuous basket of exotic fruit on the table and large portraits of
racehorses on the walls. Another door opened, and a tall, graceful woman came into the room
and introduced herself as “Valentina.” She was wearing a well-fitting black dress, striking jade
necklace and high heels. When she asked whether I would like anything to drink, it seemed more
like the prelude to an elegant dinner party than an interview about Snowden.

As Kucherena did not speak English, I brought Zamir along to translate for the conversation,
but Valentina also spoke very good English. She apologized for the delay in responding to my
requests, explaining that she received “thousands of requests” for interviews and did not have
time to answer them. When I asked how many were answered, she shrugged and said “not
many.”

At that moment, Kucherena entered with a jaunty step, a cherubic face and an untamed white
hair. He was wearing grey slacks, a partially buttoned cashmere polo sweater and a fully engaging
smile.

As [had learned from his entry in Wikipedia, he was born in a small village in the Soviet
Socialist Republic of Moldavia in 1960, and he had obtained his law degree from the All-Union
Correspondence Law Institute in 1991. He opened his own law firm in Moscow in 1995.
Kucherena’s well-known friendship with Putin evidently had not hurt his law practice. His clients
had included such well-connected defendants as Viktor Yanukovych, the overthrown president of
Ukraine in 2014; Grigory Leps, a Russian singer blacklisted by the U.S. for allegedly acting as a
money courier for a Eurasian criminal organization; Valentin Kovalev, a former Russian Minister

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011653.txt,"Reluctant though I’d been to leave the 401 for the kirya, I had particularly
enjoyed the last year. I was promoted to Shai Tamari’s job, in charge of the
intelligence team for our military operations, when Shai left to command a tank
brigade. My office was no longer on the third floor, but in the underground
bunker, the bor. I was part of nearly all high-level planning meetings, often with
Motta, sometimes also including Peres. Almost everyone around the table was
older than me, and outranked me by some distance. Yet with my intelligence
brief, I was often the one with the most thorough command of the details.
Though still just a colonel, I’d risen through Sayeret Matkal. I knew the
planning process from the other side as well, having attended the same sort of
meetings, from the early 1960s, to present our operations. So I was often asked,
and always welcome, to weigh in on what would work, what wouldn’t, and
why.

My final year in the kirya also further cemented my relationship with Motta.
Though as chief of staff, he tended to keep a formal distance from all but his
fellow generals, he did seem to enjoy having me around. He even put me in
charge of a new department of my own. Not officially. The “department” was
strictly ad hoc, as was the name which Motta gave it: Mishugas. The Yiddish
word for craziness.

All army commanders, in all countries, receive their share of unsolicited
advice. But I can’t imagine any of them gets the number, or sheer range, of wild
suggestions which make their way to the Airya. Everything from levitation
machines, to ideas for making tanks fly. Motta didn’t have the time to read all
the letters, much less sit down with the self-styled inventors or sages who
showed up in person. Still, he couldn’t be sure that a jewel of an idea wasn’t
lurking inside one of them. As an insurance policy, he began sending all the
letters, and every supplicant, to me.

I never found the jewel. The most vivid memory I have is of a visit from a
former soldier in Shaked, Israel’s Negev reconnaissance and tracking unit. He
had taken up meditation, and the study of ancient civilizations. Fresh from a
period of contemplation in the desert, he arrived in my office with a pamphlet
he’d written. It was about special-forces strategy and training, as practiced eight
centuries earlier, in the time of Genghis Khan.

I listened for nearly an hour, enjoying his enthusiasm, the history lesson, and
the simple weirdness of it all. I did check his facts afterwards. If nothing else, he
proved an assiduous student of the Mongols. He explained to me that in their
largest battles, involving tens of thousands of troops, they would designate a

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020850.txt,"...Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials

e If entitlement programs are not reformed, USA Inc.’s balance sheet will go from bad to
worse
- Public debt has doubled over the last 30 years, to 62% of GDP. This ratio is expected to surpass the
90% threshold* — above which real GDP growth could slow considerably — in 10 years and could near
150% of GDP in 20 years if entitlement expenses continue to soar, per CBO.
- As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs
continue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).

e The turning point: Within 15 years (by 2025), entitlements plus net interest expenses
will absorb all — yes, all — of USA Inc.’s annual revenue, per CBO

- That would require USA Inc. to borrow funds for defense, education, infrastructure, and R&D spending,
which today account for 32% of USA Inc. spending (excluding one-time items), down dramatically from
69% forty years ago.

- It's notable that CBO’s projection from 10 years ago (in 1999) showed Federal revenue sufficient to
support entitlement spending + interest payments until ZOG0E — 35 years later than current projection.

Note: *Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the

relationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP.

Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. We note that while

Reinhart and Rogoff’s observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer to the European

KP countries’ definition of government gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10.
(@)E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | Introduction 17

How Might One Think About Turning Around USA Inc.?...

e Key focus areas would likely be reducing USA Inc.’s budget deficit and improving /
restructuring the ‘business model’...

— One would likely drill down on USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers, then develop a
basic analytical framework for ‘normal’ revenue / expenses, then compare options.

Looking at history...

— Annual growth in revenue of 3% has been roughly in line with GDP for 40 years* while
corporate income taxes grew at 2%. Social insurance taxes (for Social Security / Medicare)
grew 5% annually and now represent 37% of USA Inc. revenue, compared with 19% in 1965.

— Annual growth in expenses of 3% has been roughly in line with revenue, but entitlements are
up 5% per annum - and now absorb 51% of all USA Inc.’s expense - more than twice their
share in 1965; defense and other discretionary spending growth has been just 1-2%.

One might ask...

— Should expense and revenue levels be re-thought and re-set so USA Inc. operates near
break-even and expense growth (with needed puts and takes) matches GDP growth, thus
adopting a ‘don’t spend more than you earn’ approach to managing USA Inc.'s financials?

Note: *We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of revenue and expenses. We did not choose the most recent
40-year period (1969 to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent significant tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969, so

KP many metrics (like individual income and corporate profit) varied significantly from ‘normal’ levels.

evaluated regularly and evaluation is taught explicitly in business
school. Political scientists evaluate politicians and political systems.
Historians evaluate what makes governments, battles, cities, and a
range of other things successful. Architects and urban planners and
engineers worry about evaluation of what they propose and produce.
All of these people could combine to teach students how to evaluate.
This is very important part of functioning in any society.

First College Year Summary

It would be my contention that a freshman year made up of these
four processes, taught in four simultaneous courses that were designed
to relate to one another in various ways and at specific times, would be
a wonderful thing for teaching people how to think. The best of our
faculty could teach what they thought about to students, who now
would be ready to start to think rigorously. By the end of this first year,
students could begin to specialize, not in academic subjects just yet,
but in other processes that build on the conceptual processes.

SECOND YEAR IN COLLEGE
Let’s look at the analytic processes.
Analytic Processes

Diagnosis. Who does diagnosis? Doctors certainly. Lawyers cer-
tainly. All the people I mentioned above who are building models
need to figure out why their models may have gone wrong. Anyone
who manages people or large operations needs to figure out all the
time what has gone wrong. In fact, diagnosis is a critical part of nearly
every area of thinking and every area of work. Diagnosis needs to be
studied for its own sake. How do we do diagnosis in principle, no mat-
ter what the situation?

Diagnosis also needs to be examined in the various contexts in
which it can be applied. A course in diagnosis, taught by the entire fac-
ulty who do diagnosis regularly, showing real work and real situations
that they have had to handle, and coming after the first year, would
have two advantages. One, it could build on the basic conceptual

department affairs, never about computer science. We had nothing to
say to one another about that. The same is true in every department.
Academic departments are made up of faculty who have been thrown
together for historical reasons but really have no business being in the
same department.

What does a clinical psychologist have in common with someone
who studies animal behavior? Do they talk about crazy chimps? What
does an historical linguist have to say to a Chomskian linguist? What
does someone who works on the philosophy of mind have to say to
someone who studies religious philosophy?

Departments probably should have been organized around ideas
instead of around words. I tried to facilitate that when I helped create
cognitive science as a discipline by founding the Journal of Cognitive
Science and the Cognitive Science Society. That was over 30 years ago
and while some cognitive science departments have been created, in
the end the disciplines that study the mind continue to do so in their
own ways. Computer scientists who study the mind build comput-
er models, and psychologists who study the mind run experiments.
Anthropologists who study the mind do descriptions. That these are
three of the twelve cognitive processes is no accident. Departments are
organized to some extent around the processes that they use, but that
is by no means the central organizing principle. As that old adversary
to the creation of the Yale Computer Science Department said, the
central organizing principle was a machine and that is kind of silly.

Who suffers from this state of affairs? The students, of course.
When a department’s faculty meets to decide what courses students
must take in order to major in their field, it is not a sage conversation
among scholars about what it means to be a computer scientist or psy-
chologist. It is a political tug fest, where people from very diverse fields
within these departments push and shove for turf.

Why do they care? There are two big reasons. First, if no one signs
up for the courses you teach, you won't be teaching them for long.
Second, if many students sign up for the courses you teach, you can
justify hiring more faculty in your subdiscipline, which means more
friends to hang out with and more power in department meetings
where the votes can now go your way. You think this stuff doesn’t
matter? These issues are the lifeblood of every university department.

Let’s look at both of these and see why they might matter.

An Epstein sex case is settled;
Dershowitz denies latest
allegation

BY JULIE K. BROWN
DECEMBER 19, 2018 8:30 PM, UPDATED DECEMBER 27, 2018 7:55 AM

Accused sex traffickers Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell have settled a federal civil lawsuit
filed by a woman who says she was ordered under threat of violence to have sex with them and
other influential individuals when she was in her early 20s, sources confirmed Wednesday.

Sarah Ransome, who now lives in Barcelona, claimed that she was recruited and trafficked for
sex by the pair in 2006 and 2007 — at the same time that Epstein, a wealthy New York hedge
fund manager, was under federal investigation for molesting dozens of underage girls at his
Palm Beach mansion.

With regard to your point that the attraction of foreign investment has been among the priorities of economic
mobility in the UAE; it is an inaccurate assumption. Investment plans have no limits or boundaries. There are
foreign investments in the UAE, and the=2 OUAE in its turn has countless investments in many regions of the
world. Investments imply promising opportunities ina favorable environment. This is what attracted foreign
investment to the UAE, and the investment environment remains favorable in the UAE; the opportunities are
still promising, and the UAE 1s still the most important regional center for business and international trade.
Today, it is more promising than ever before, and the advent of smart investors to the UAE has not stopped.
By Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper

Security and profit are two very important concepts for the investor, and it is known
that the UAE has been a breeding ground for the development of capital in recent years.
This was reflected on the arrival of the most prominent businessmen, major companies
and famous brands to the country. The active UAE financial market contributed to the
success of many companies, which turned into public joint stock companies, with billions
of dirhams having been pumped into their capital. This means that thousands of
investors were involved in the ownership of shares. Recently, however, we have witnessed
legal and financial issues involving prominent names of UAE nationals. What does Your
Highness have to say with regard to the investment community in the UAE on the
capacity of governmental oversight of corporate governance and management of the
shareholders and their rights?

These legal issues are evidence of firm government20concern about good corporate governance and its
commitment to sound accounting principles, rules of governance and transparency. The government is
constantly working to develop bodies, procedures and safeguards. No one 1s above the law in the UAE, and
whoever crosses the line will be sought by judicial authorities and legally tried.

By Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper

In light of the talk about the scarcity of liquidity in the domestic market, Dubai US$20
billion in bonds. Central Bank is subscribing to $10 billion of those bonds. Officials of the
Emirate stated that there is no current need for the rest of the money. Does this mean that
the Government of Dubai has closed the doors for new subscription to a second tranche?
Will support be provided by the Government of Dubai for the companies as a grant?

The doors to subscription have not been shut down. The subscriptions so far meet our requirements. The
support given to companies is not a grant, because its origin is the bill, and companies possess productive assets
that enable them to meet all the requirements. The problem of these companies is part of the liquidity problem
that has afflicted the financial system and banking world.

By Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper

Looking at the entities that will avail from Dubai government’s financial support, can we
say that Dubai government affiliate companies have overestimated their financial
capabilities to cover development requirements, then subsequently their administrations
became responsible for the level of these companies’ transparency in handling their
projects?

But Yoni was killed.”

I sought out two other friends: Mookie and Ephraim Sneh, the Battalion 890
doctor, who had been with us at the Chinese Farm. Both were obviously torn
between a sense of accomplishment in having freed the hostages and the blow
of losing Yoni. I asked Ephraim to take me to the front of the plane’s huge belly
to see him. He was on a stretcher, covered with a blanket. I peeled it back.
Yon1’s face had lost all color. But when I touched his forehead, it seemed
slighty warm, almost as if there was still a spark of life inside him.

I couldn’t raise Kuti by radio, so I used the landline in the airport director’s
office to phone Motta.

“Yoni is dead,” I told him.
“Are you sure?” he asked. I said: “Yes. P’ve seen him.”

Before the transport planes began leaving for Israel, I made another call. It
was to Nava. She was asleep. I told her that the operation to free the hostages
had succeeded. “But Yoni has been killed.” I could hear her gasp. “Listen,” I
said, “you have to go downstairs. Tell Bruria. Before some army officer shows
up at her door. Or worse, because they’re not married, no one may come and
she’ Il hear it on the radio. Go. Tell her. Stay with her.” At first, she seemed not
so much unwilling as unable to do it. “What can I say?” I said I knew how hard
it would be, but that she needed to make sure Bruria heard the news from a
friend. Later, Nava told me she’d waited until daybreak, not wanting to make
things worse by waking her. Then, she went downstairs. She told Bruria what
had happened, stayed with her, talked with her, and held her, during those first
few awful hours.

I found Yoni’s death even more upsetting when I learned from Mookie and
others how it had happened. As the sayeret motorcade began making its way
from the Hercules to the terminal, with Mookie and Yoni in the Mercedes, two
Ugandan soldiers had seen them. One of the Ugandans raised his rifle. Rather
than relying on Mookie’s assurances the soldier wouldn’t actually fire, Yoni and
another soldier shot him with their silenced Berettas. But they’d only wounded
him. In case he managed to fire back, another soldier in the Jeep behind them
killed him, with his un-silenced machine gun.

Now that all surprise was gone, the commandos abandoned their vehicles
and began sprinting towards the old terminal. Only seconds later, still 80 yards

The shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In one take Michael
makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on the set is courteous but quick and tense.
There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit.

I watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers' canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff (Monsters Ball) and
Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first Wall Street.” They have asked me to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene
and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture
gowns. Give me the night before the Titanic goes down, were his exact words. Not a problem.

I pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his personal publicist
when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for Wall Street and we have remained great friends. Gekko is just as
challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones’
Broadway debut in a Little Night Music. Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts
received for their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th.

I tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him and the
production.

8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 65th Street and
Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia
Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial
titan husband David is unaware where she is this morning.

Vanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage Geoffrey Beene,
and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow fake flower on his lapel. Costume
Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited.

Oliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone’s “W”’). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, a ruthless Wall
Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their
huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still
famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the ‘60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and
replaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's
vision.

At 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, and her friend
Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production assistants fuss over them.
Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate
wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director’s mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy,
Hamish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops.

Oliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene, gives out lines
to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings are too small. Wardrobe
jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, Action. The kid plays the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for
money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours
later a PA yells, Lunch.

In costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet “The Harpies, including Liz Smith, Barbara
Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak.

Graydon Carter is at the next table. I tell htm Oliver Stone wants him in Wall Street 2 as an extra. (I make this up.) Graydon
jokes that he only works with lines. I say, Not a problem. (This will be news to Oliver.)

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012848.txt,"presented in the last section, Eberhardt was also interested in the possibility that if people carry this
association around in their head, they do so unconsciously, despite explicit avowals that they are not at all
racist. And if they carry this association around unconsciously, how does it impact upon their judgments
and actions?

In one experiment with both Caucasian and non-Caucasian subjects, Eberhardt used a technique
called subliminal priming. Subliminal priming involves rapidly presenting pictures, sounds or other
experiences under the radar of awareness and then presenting material that falls within our radar. If the
two experiences are similar, the unconscious version affects subjects’ perception of the conscious one.
For example, if you first prime people by flashing the picture of a woman’s face, subjects then respond
faster to faces of women than to faces of men. In other words, despite the fact that subjects are unaware of
the prime, it affects their judgments. Eberhardt first primed subjects with photographed faces of
Caucasian or Black people or an unrecognizable non-face. They then watched a short movie that started
off with an unrecognizable object that looked like it was covered by dense snow. As the movie
progressed, the snow lifted, making it easier to recognize the object as a line drawing of either a duck,
dolphin, alligator, squirrel or ape. Subjects stopped the movie as soon as they recognized the animal.

Compared with Caucasian faces and non-faces, priming with Black faces caused subjects to stop
the movie much sooner for apes, but not for any other animal. Compared with non-faces, priming with
Caucasian faces caused subjects to stop the movie much /ater for apes, but not for any other animal. This
suggests that Black faces made it easier to identify apes, whereas Caucasian faces made it harder to
identify apes, with no comparable effects for any other animals. Caucasian and non-Caucasian subjects
showed the same pattern of response, and so too did individuals with and without strong, explicit racial
attitudes. Although the similarity among Caucasian and non-Caucasian subjects is of interest, and
suggests that the association is held even among those who were perhaps less strongly associated with
this form of dehumanization, there were relatively few Black subjects in this non-Caucasian group. This
first set of experiments suggests, therefore, that among a racially heterogeneous group of educated
Stanford undergraduates, individuals carry an unconscious association between Black people and apes,
and thus, an unconsciously dehumanized representation of another human being. Given the animal form
of this dehumanization, the implication from Haslam’s work is that Caucasians associate Blacks with less
rationality, civility, and self-control, in essence, less uniquely human qualities.

These are remarkable and disturbing findings. They can’t be explained by some superficial
similarity between human faces and animals because Eberhardt found the same results when she
presented either line drawings or words of animals. Had Eberhardt used actual photographs of animals,
subjects could have used similarity in skin color or nose shape — for example, seeing a black human face

would prime seeing a black ape face because both have the color black in common. Line drawings and

crisis of the underpinnings of capitalism, and on top of that we’re now, I believe, at the

beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism.

“With all the baggage that those [right-wing]

Benjamin Harnwell, Human Dignity Institute: Thank you, Steve. That was a
fascinating, fascinating overview. I am particularly struck by your argument, then, that in
fact, capitalism would spread around the world based on the Judeo-Christian foundation
is, in fact, something that can create peace through peoples rather than antagonism,
which is often a point not sufficiently appreciated. Before I turn behind me to take a
question —

Bannon: One thing I want to make sure of, if you look at the leaders of capitalism at that
time, when capitalism was I believe at its highest flower and spreading its benefits to most
of mankind, almost all of those capitalists were strong believers in the Judeo-Christian
West. They were either active participants in the Jewish faith, they were active
participants in the Christians’ faith, and they took their beliefs, and the underpinnings of
their beliefs was manifested in the work they did. And I think that’s incredibly important
and something that would really become unmoored. I can see this on Wall Street today —
I can see this with the securitization of everything is that, everything is looked at as a
securitization opportunity. People are looked at as commodities. I don’t believe that our
forefathers had that same belief.

Harnwell: Over the course of this conference we’ve heard from various points of view
regarding alleviation of poverty. We’ve heard from the center-left perspective, we’ve

heard from the socialist perspective, we’ve heard from the Christian democrat, if you will,

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011121.txt,"then pictured a future instant’s worth of expected satisfaction. Its perceived value at
that future moment would give its perceived value now save for differences
explained by the time gap between. I adopted the old terms time preference or time
discount rate to account for whatever they might be. There was no assumption as to
whether the rate should prove positive or negative or zero, nor that the same rate
should apply to other future instants. My goal was to leave not even the farthest-
fetched of loopholes. If 1 have succeeded, the present value rule followed as
subjective certitude giving exact expectations, though not outcomes, for each future
instant and thus for all together. Note that my depreciation theory follows, but with
the caveat that the version I have shown adds the usual assumption that time
preference is positive. That part is not certitude, although neither are we likely to

doubt it.

It was not hard to derive the maximand rule as the next step. Once we define tastes
or more generally aims as whatever behavior reveals, the rest follows quickly.

(Remember that I have no problem with mutually circular definitions.)

There were probably a few heuristic novelties. The parable of the boss and her
secretary might itself be new. So might the slave paradox with its parable of Phil and
Bill. Many including Adam Smith have pointed out economic inefficiencies in slavery,
moral criticism aside. | can’t recall mention of this most obvious one. Bill’s
maintenance consumption was taste-satisfying cash flow to Bill, and capitalized in
his present value to himself. It is pure expense to Phil once Bill is enslaved. If all but
one of us were enslaved by the one left, national output would drop by substantially

all maintenance consumption on the books of the one slaveowner.

There may also be minor novelty in my analogy between accounting for the firm and
accounting for human capital in Chapter 6. One possible example is my use of the
term “decapitalization” to include depletion and liquidation in sale as well as
depreciation. It simplifies to depreciation in the case of human capital because that

factor cannot be alienated in reinvestment or gift or sale. One inference was that

a square, a stock exchange, a park. All organized, it appears, using completely
ethereal techniques: Text messages, video postings, chat rooms. Similar movements
appear around in the world. In Iran, in Italy, in Russia. “Occupy Wall Street”,
blossoms in New York City, a protest against wealth inequality and finance. It
becomes a self-franchising social movement, appearing in hundreds of cities:
Occupy Hollywood. Occupy Central in Hong Kong. Occupy - strangely — Vegas.

Then in Sidi Bouzid, a Tunisian town you've never heard of, far away from all these
unstable looking mobs, a spark lands. A local man has set himself on fire. Police
(worse, a police woman) had confiscated his scales and his fruit and then tossed him
around for no reason other than that he was poor and could do nothing about it. It is
November 2010. Within hours protests begin in Sidi Bouzid. They spread to Tunis.
81Then Tripoli. Then Damascus. You watch as the anger, moving on once-invisible
technological lines of video and text, demolishes the stability of all of North Africa.
Over the next two years leaders are pushed from power in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and
Yemen: their names, instead of being symbols of stability, instantly cast as sources
of injustice. Other countries - Syria, Algeria, Sudan, and Bahrain tumble for periods
into the black hole of civil violence. Some people mistake all this for a democratic
revolution. Over time, however, it’s clear this is hardly that. Something more
complex is emerging from the violent mist. New, nearly virtual terror groups
organized themselves in the vacuum, hyper-lethal versions of connected protest. A
new kind of political energy, a method of linking people and ideas and an easy
destructive power, is alive. It seems to be as active in cynical, murderous
fundamentalists as in the optimistic peace-hoping youth. Democratic revolution? No.
Revolution? Yes, clearly, that.

A few years later, after you've been replaced or are on the run, after your own
country has had upheaval and you've had your visit from a well-meaning American
diplomat urging you towards a quiet retirement house in Saudi Arabi, the Spanish
social philosopher Manuel Castells will name the disease that undid you. Castells is
perhaps an unlikely figure to diagnose the political illness that infected so much of
the world after 2008. An elfin, kinetic figure with a disorganized mop of grey hair, he
sports the wardrobe of an accountant and a rolling Spanish accent that flavors his
speech with a surprising taste of romance. It’s a mixture that seems somehow ideal
for a world often on his lips: “Reevolootion.” With the meticulous care an
anthropologist might bring to documenting a distant, undiscovered tribe, Castells
has spent decades finger-poking, classifying and explaining networks. In the late
1990s his books, lectures and research set the frame for the world we inhabit: fast-
changing, ripped through by communications and technology, linked in unusual
ways. “The network society,” he explained, “represents a qualitative change in the
human experience,” he explained. 8

CURATED BY WOLFE VON LENKIEWICZ & VICTORIA GOLEMBIOVSKAYA

PRESS CLIPPING (INTERNET)

The House of the Noble Man

15.10.2010

2 Cornwall Terrace, a magnificent 18th-century building off Regent’s Park and a stone’s throw from Frieze art fair,
will be the venue for this spectacular exhibition featuring Old Masters and famous names from contemporary art,
including Picasso, Manet, Cézanne, Damien Hirst, Banksy, Martin Kippenberger and Gerhard Richter. Work from
the Saatchi Gallery’s ‘New Sensations 2010 ‘ including jotta artist Joshua Bilton also on show.

The show imagines the house’s inhabitant as a hugely successful trader. Having used his mastery of technology
and the possibilities of the information age to amass vast wealth, he aspires to find a shaping narrative for the
etiolated form of his existence. Art is one of the avenues in his search.

He may live in a nobleman’s house, but he’s no blue blood. A tax exile, nomadic by habit, our collector spends his
days - and nights - bathed in the blue light of a computer screen, as he trades in dematerialized securities, or
prices options based on weather conditions on the other side of the globe: drowned cities viewed remotely via
CNN, or better, modelled via a computer simulation.

The roles of the nobleman and artist found a convergence in the figure of Don Quixote, a fool who aspired to the
chivalric codes he’d read about in antiquated texts. But this fantasy was a liberation; allowing him to contend with
base matter, infusing it with near-infinite possibilities, just as the empirical certainties of the Renaissance would
soon give way to the vertiginous perspectives of the new mathematics.

The exhibition updates the Don Quixote model to cast the collector/artist/nobleman as a man without qualities,
occupying the privileged space of the capitalist elite, looking down through a virtual window to plot the
constantly-changing vectors of matter, bodies and events as they hurtle by on the other side of the glass.

that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think
strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors,
and that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States, and
I think it’s what can see us forward.

You know, Putin’s been quite an interesting character. He’s also very, very, very intelligent.
I can see this in the United States where he’s playing very strongly to social conservatives
about his message about more traditional values, so I think it’s something that we have to
be very much on guard of. Because at the end of the day, I think that Putin and his cronies
are really a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to expand. However,
I really believe that in this current environment, where you're facing a potential new
caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation — I’m not saying we can put it on
a back burner — but I think we have to deal with first things first.

Questioner: One of my questions has to do with how the West should be responding to
radical Islam. How, specifically, should we as the West respond to Jihadism without losing
our own soul? Because we can win the war and lose ourselves at the same time. How
should the West respond to radical Islam and not lose itself in the process?

Bannon: From a perspective — this may be a little more militant than others. I think
definitely you’re going to need an aspect that is [unintelligible]. I believe you should take a
very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other
aspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive and that’s fine.

If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I
believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think
they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places... It
bequeathed to use the great institution that is the church of the West.

And I would ask everybody in the audience today, because you really are the movers and
drivers and shakers and thought leaders in the Catholic Church today, is to think, when
people 500 years from now are going to think about today, think about the actions you’ve
taken — and I believe everyone associated with the church and associated with the Judeo-
Christian West that believes in the underpinnings of that and believes in the precepts of
that and want to see that bequeathed to other generations down the road as it was

dysfunctional dopamine system, which might help explain the overconfidence in their beliefs, especially
beliefs in powerful religious icons. Winning boosts confidence, which increases the chances of winning
again. This is a highly adaptive cycle that can lead to overconfidence.

Dominic Johnson took advantage of the research on human and animal competition to explore the
link between overconfidence, testosterone, and war within the context of a simulated game. Each subject
played the role of a leader in a country at war with another over diamond resources. The goal of the game
was to accrue the highest level of resources or defeat the neighboring country. Though war games ona
computer can not capture the full reality of war, the fact is that military specialists throughout the world
use simulations to prepare combatants for some of the strategic and emotional problems they will
confront.

Most subjects judged that they would outcompete their opponents, and this was exacerbated in
males relative to females. Those who believed that they would whip their opponents actually had the
worst records, suggesting that they were not only uncalibrated but that their distortion of reality led to
costly outcomes. Those with the highest expectation of victory had the highest testosterone levels and
were most likely to launch unprovoked attacks on their opponents.

Whether in real life or in the simulated world of computer games, brimming overconfidence can
lead to a distorted sense of risk and the odds of victory in war — or any competitive arena. Though this is
a costly strategy, there are clear evolutionary benefits under conditions explained by Trivers and Johnson.
Self-deception is favored when opponents have imperfect information about their strengths and
weaknesses, and where the payoffs are high relative to the costs. Self-deception leads individuals to go
for it, convincing themselves and others that the risks are low, the gains are great, and the standard social
norms are no longer applicable. This is a dangerous form of denial, recruiting moral disengagement to
justify horrific means and ends. This is a piece of the psychology that can facilitate the process of
runaway desire. This is a piece of the psychology that enables individuals to cause great harms.

My goal in this book has been to find the universal core of evil, the elements or ingredients that
are shared across all cases of evil. My suggestion is that the mixture of desire and denial are both
necessary and sufficient ingredients in the recipe for evil. All other ingredients are flourishes, creative
additions that do not take away from the universal core. Within each of us is a recipe for causing
excessive harm and for expressing exceptional compassion. We have choices. But as evidence
accumulates from the sciences, it has become increasingly clear that some of us have fewer choices than
others. Some of us are equipped to resist the temptations of a culture of evil, while others fall prey. This is

the story of our species. This is our story.

take depreciation theory seriously.

Market-Valued Capital in Macroeconomics

Another reason why macro should be reconceived from scratch is that its defining
equations, written mostly over half a century ago, leave out capital. Change in capital
shows as net investment, but capital itself stays outside. Flows are considered

sufficient for description.

Piketty, a good economic historian, tells us that this did not have to be. It seems that
the largest economies had good records of market-valued capital since the late-
middle nineteenth century. Piketty does not speculate why macro and national

accounts ignored them when both took form in the 1920s and 1930s.

Physical capital and its changes can be measured at market or calculated by the
perpetual inventory method used in balance sheets. | showed in Chapter 2 why that
method is not the best. Depreciation accounting assumes norms in the loss of capital
value with time, and gets the news of actual outcomes long after. National accounts
reported positive real net investment, meaning growth in capital value, in 1929,

1930, 1937 and 2008. They give little clue to reality in years of surprise.

The neglect of market-valued capital in macro and the national accounts until 1990
or so may have to do with the influence of Keynes. The General Theory includes
some hilarious broadsides on the fickleness of market speculators. He put more
trust in the sober disciplines of accounting. Piketty trusts the market more, and so

do I.

Then why does Piketty track new investment, or change in capital, by the accounting
methods used in national accounts? That seems inconsistent. My charts and tables

track it at market. It seems to me that national accounts should track it both ways,

Repatriation impact

We estimated cumulative overseas profits for the S&P 500 excluding Financials and
Real Estate via three sources: 1) Bloomberg data on cash held overseas (if
disclosed/available}, 2) BofAML analyst estimates on cumulative overseas profits or
cash, and 3) our own estimate if neither (1) or (2) are available, based on (Total cash x
[% of foreign sales +10%J]) for companies with at least 5% foreign sales.

We apply the effective tax rates proposed by Trump (10%) and the Blueprint (8.75%) to
our estimated $1.2tn in overseas cash to determine taxes due for the S&P 500 ex.
Financials & Real Estate. We estimate that 100% is brought back given that the tax is
mandatory. To compute the one-time tax impact to GAAP EPS, we divide the cumulative
tax impact by the S&P 500 divisor, after first excluding the impact from several large
multinationals (e.g. AAPL) which already provision a portion of their overseas profits for
US taxes and have effective US tax rates well above 35%.

Note that for companies for which our analysts provided estimates, we asked them to
provide cumulative overseas profits if possible, but in most cases this number reflects
overseas cash. Thus, taxes paid could be slightly higher than we estimate given that
both the Blueprint and Trump’s plans suggest a mandatory tax on all accumulated
overseas profits, some of which may be permanently reinvested; here, the Blueprint
suggests a lower 3.5% tax for retained earnings not held in cash/equivalents, suggesting
that any additional taxes payable that we are not capturing are likely to be small.

To calculate the % EPS impact from buybacks, we subtract the amount of taxes payable
from total cash brought back for the S&P 500 ex. Financials & Real Estate (and for each
sector) and divide this by the market cap for the S&P 500 (and for each sector.) We
multiply this % impact for the overall index by our 2018E EPS of $137 to determine the
potential EPS impact, applying various buyback scenarios (10-100%). We use 50% as a
base case scenario, which is lower than the 80% brought back during the 2004 tax
holiday, to be conservative.

Border adjustments impact on EPS

We estimate the costs of goods imported and exported for each company using the
latest company filings, conversations with analysts, industry research, management
commentary and the Input-Output accounts data published by the U.S. Department of
Commerce. For more information about the Input-Output accounts data, please refer to
the Bureau of Economic Analysis website at http://www.bea.gov/industry/io_annual.htm.

When using the estimates based on Input-Output accounts, we adjust them to account
for the varying foreign exposures of different S&P 500 industries. For companies that
source products through importers (e.g. retailers), we only included the costs of goods
estimated to be directly imported by each company, as taxes pertaining to those
imported goods should be paid by the importers themselves.

We estimate the earnings impact of border adjustments based on the additional taxes
that companies would pay on the costs of imported goods sold in the US (non-
deductible) and any reduction in taxes related to the production costs for exported
goods (deductible). To calculate this, we multiple the net value of imported COGS by the
assumed tax rate. Note that the net impact can be either positive or negative depending
on whether the company is a net importer or exporter. We assume a 50% haircut to the
impact to account for from alternate sourcing, currency rates and pricing power.

Lower corporate tax rate impact on EPS

We estimate the normalized effective domestic tax rate of a company based on
conversations with the analysts or the median 5-year domestic income tax rate. If a
company had a negative tax rate for a particular year, we exclude the tax rate of that

Two officials and a third person confirmed the consideration of the value-added tax, while one official and the third

person confirmed the consideration of the carbon tax.

The search for new options reflects a recognition of the political challenges facing a proposal known as a border-
adjustment tax that the White House and some Republicans had begun to rally around. The proposal, effectively a tax
on imports, would not only raise needed revenue but also serve to fulfill Trump’s pledge to protect American

companies from unfair export competition.

The tax would create incentives for companies to manufacture and produce goods domestically. But the proposal is
unpopular with many other Republicans, who have said it would raise costs for consumers on things such as

automobiles, electronics and clothing.

A value-added tax and a carbon tax have long been favored tools among economists, including some on the right, to
raise revenue in a way that supports economic growth. But the prospect of any new taxes has long drawn skepticism

from Republicans.

In their Rule 21 Motion, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 do not claim that they were omitted
from this proceeding due to any “inadvertence” or “mistake” by Petitioners; rather, they seek to
join this proceeding as parties that could have been permissively joined in the original petition
under Rule 20 (“Permissive Joinder of Parties”). As courts generally use the standards of Rule
15 to evaluate such circumstances, the Court will consider the joinder issue as presented in the
Rule 15 Motion.’ The Court will consider the arguments presented in the Rule 21 Motion as if
they are set forth in the Rule 15 Motion as well. Because the arguments are presented in the Rule
15 Motion (and because the Court is denying the Rule 15 Motion on its merits, as discussed
below), the Rule 21 Motion will be denied.

The Court also concludes that portions of the Rule 21 Motion and related
filings should be stricken from the record. Pending for this Court’s consideration is a Motion
for Limited Intervention filed by Alan M. Dershowitz, who seeks to intervene to “strike the
outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and [to] request[] a show cause order to
the attorneys that have made them.” (DE 282 at 1). The Court has considered Mr. Dershowitz’s
arguments, but it finds that his intervention is unnecessary as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(f) empowers the Court “on its own” to “strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any
redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).

Petitioners’ Rule 21 Motion consists of relatively little argumentation regarding why the

Court should permit them to join in this action: they argue that (1) they were sexually abused by

governs the addition of parties under Rule 21 and Rule 15. See Goston v. Potter, No. 08-cv-478

Alas, though, the main strategy of Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas
will be to drag Israel into the Arab story — as a way of deflecting
attention away from how these anti-democratic regimes are repressing
their own people and to further delegitimize Israel, by making sure it
remains a permanent occupier of Palestinians in the West Bank.

Have no illusions: The main goal of the rejectionists today is to lock
Israel into the West Bank — so the world would denounce it as some
kind of Jewish apartheid state, with a Jewish minority permanently
ruling a Palestinian majority, when you combine Israel’s Arabs and
the West Bank Arabs. With a more democratic Arab world, where
everyone can vote, that would be a disaster for Israel. It may be
unavoidable, but it would be insane for Israel to make it so by failing
to aggressively pursue a secure withdrawal option.

The second group that will have to pay retail for stability is the Arab
monarchies — Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Morocco.
These governments have for decades bought stability with reform
wholesale — by offering faux reforms, like reshuffling cabinets, that
never amounted to real power sharing — and by distracting their
people with shiny objects. But these monarchies totally underestimate
the depth of what has erupted in their region: a profound quest for
personal dignity, justice and freedom that is not going away. They
will have to share more power.

The third group I hope will have to pay retail is Egypt’s Muslim
Brotherhood. Under Mubarak, in an odd way, the Brotherhood had it
easy. Mubarak made sure that no authentic, legitimate, progressive,
modern Egyptian party could emerge between himself and the
Muslim Brotherhood. That way, Mubarak could come to Washington
once a year and tell the president: “Look, it’s either me or the Muslim
Brotherhood. We have no independent, secular moderates.”
Therefore, to get its votes, all the Muslim Brotherhood had to say was
that “Mubarak is a Zionist” and “Islam is the answer.” It didn’t have

the Tagammu, as well as by a large collection of NGOs and other
representatives of civil society.

To some extent, these general orientations shaped the stances,
whether for or against, in the referendum on the constitutional
amendments, which drew the first clear lines in the post-25 January
political map. In that referendum, the first camp obtained 77.2 per
cent of the vote versus 22.8 per cent for the second. However, it is
important to bear in mind that, in this referendum, a critical mass of
voters sided with the first camp because they felt that the amendments
bill offered the clearest path to the transition from revolutionary
legitimacy to the legitimacy of the established state, which is to say to
the return to normalcy that Egyptians desperately yearned for at the
time. But this sentiment will no longer be a major factor now that this
wish has come true and elections are at hand in September.
Therefore, it remains open which way this key group of voters will
swing in those elections, the results of which will be crucial to the
subsequent selection of the constitutional committee and then to the
choice of president.

Several factors will be instrumental in determining the impact of the
critical mass of Egyptian voters. Foremost among them will be their
turnout at the polls. Only 41 per cent of the 45 million eligible voters
took part in the referendum. This relatively low figure could be
increased by increasing the number of polling stations, of which there
are only 44,000 at present, a factor that has long deterred all but the
most committed from braving long voting queues. Secondly,
although judicial supervision will now guarantee the integrity of the
polls and ensure that people's votes really do count, the proportional
electoral list system will yield very different kinds of results than
those produced by the individual candidate system. A third critical
factor will be campaign financing. Election campaigns and buying
television air-time in particular have become extraordinarily

start. The United States will have to work
from smaller troop footprints and be
prepared to start fighting even as follow-
on-forces are on the way. Ideally, these
forces would flow from multiple staging
positions to reduce vulnerability to
nuclear attack. The politics of the region,
however, will work against securing a
multitude of staging areas from which to
deploy.

The region under the purview of
Centcom has always been riddled with
political violence that has posed
formidable challenges to military
operations. But in plotting a course over
the horizon, the political and military
obstacles for American military surges
into the region are poised to grow even
larger. As a result, theater contingency
planners will have fewer good options for
projecting American military power into
the region -- and they'll have to do more
with the bad and the ugly.

work preserved. And that actions taken by the Grand Jury would remain
in effect.

This, however, would probably not be true if the Attorney General
refused the next Special Counsel's budget request—due on July 1. That
would shut down the whole operation—the Special Counsel staff and
grand juries. There might, however, according to research the team has
prepared, be enough time between the order and the shuttering for the
Special Counsel to share the grand jury evidence with other federal
prosecutors, who might act on their own authority to pursue the
President.

The President's constitutional pardon powers appear to be some
of the most troubling and threatening issues for the Special Counsel. The
Counsel's office believes the President will use his pardon power as an
instrument to undermine the investigation.

According to present and former White House advisors, the
President's recent spate of pardons are in part his way of taunting the
Special Counsel. The White House, according to these sources, is aware
that the Special Counsel has concluded the President's pardon power is
near absolute: the President can certainly pardon himself, and others
involved in the investigation.

Early in June, the Special Counsel, believing that a pardon for
Michael Flynn was imminent, rushed to build a case that might form an
exception to the President's pardon authority. The argument, perhaps a
slim-thread one, tries to undermine what both the White House and
many outside legal authorities, and much of the Special Counsel's own
research, believes to be one of the few unchallengeable powers granted
the President. In effect, the Special Counsel continues the theme of it’s
case: there is a level of obstruction of justice that all reasonable men
might know when they see it. If you pardon someone to get yourself off
the hook, that’s a corrupt action. The constitution is not a statute that
you might violate, but a larger covenant which you might offend (or,
equally, that might protect you). Since the President is in charge of
upholding the constitution and much of the constitution is about
preventing corrupt acts or abuses of power, the pardon, in the case of
Michael Flynn, is, the Mueller team is set to argue, unconstitutional.
What's more, since there is an impeachment process in place—or there
are impeachment resolutions before congress—and impeachment is the
province of Congress, a pardon of a potential witness in this

have now provided documents to the Washington Post repeating the false charges, but have
failed to provide the Post with the emails that fatally undermine them. These selective
disclosures, and this use of the court’s protective and sealing orders “as a sword,” are manifestly
improper.

Professor Dershowitz intends to pursue all available remedies for violations of the
district court’s orders, including sanctions. That said, to remedy the gross imbalance in available
information created by counsel’s improper disclosures, we ask that the parties’ counsel
immediately agree to a stipulation, to be so-ordered by Judge Sweet, unsealing and removing the
confidentiality designations from Ms. HEEB emails. This will allow for full public
disclosure of these matters—where their falsity, exposed to the “sunlight” of public review, will
be manifest—and it will permit Professor Dershowitz to respond fully to the accusations
plaintift’s counsel leaked to the Washington Post. Only with such full disclosure can the public
decide who is telling the truth.

Please let us know your response to this request by noon on February 9, 2018.

Very truly yours,

pursuits. Every university has underground lists, written by students,
about courses that are easy or professors who readily give good grades.
The real agenda of the majority of students is to take school just seri-
ously enough to graduate. If you offered them a diploma after 1 year,
most of them would take the deal.

This all brings me back to our aerospace friend. Why does he want
high schools to teach more math? Because he doesn’t want to teach it.
Teaching undergraduates becomes pleasurable at precisely the point
where you can teach the very courses this man teaches. He is teach-
ing highly technical courses, and, it is safe to assume, the students
who are taking those courses are there with serious intentions. They
want to become engineers and they want to know what he knows. So
he may well enjoy teaching them. But he certainly would not enjoy
teaching them calculus. There is a big difference in the experience of
teaching when you are teaching people who plan on working in your
field some day and when you are teaching a required course that stu-
dents wish they weren’t being made to take.

But why does it matter what this man enjoys teaching?

In the ideal university, the one professors at top-tier universities
would have if it were possible, professors, who consider themselves
primarily to be researchers in very specialized subfields, would teach
only work that directly related to their actual research or was impor-
tant for preparing future researchers in their field.

Professors at Yale get to be professors at Yale because they are either
potentially or actually the best in the world at something. While this
might not actually be true, it is certainly supposed to be true. When
a professor is proposed to be promoted (or hired for the first time) as
a full professor at Yale, the chair of his department must address a
meeting of all the other chairs and high officials and explain why the
professor in question is indeed the best in the world at what he does.
To do this, the chairs often have to define what he does extremely
narrowly to have it be at all credible. Isn’t there someone at Stanford
or Princeton who is just as good or, perish the thought, even better
than the candidate you propose? There better not be or this candidate
won't get voted in. So, somewhere in every professor’s mind is the idea
that he or she is the best at something or for assistant professors, soon
will become the best at something.

Under this kind of pressure, and this kind of egotism, a professor’s
first and foremost concern is attaining and maintaining that exalted

Baylor Nation on college game day.

As | mentioned in a previous chapter, “Field of Dreams” brought into popular culture an abiding idea — if
you build it, they will come. Unlike a Midwestern corn field turned into a ghostly baseball diamond
summoning forth spirits from bygone days, McLaneean Stadium — which at Coach Briles’ insistence was
renamed (prior to opening) to carry the McLean family name rather than the institutionalized, plain-
vanilla “Baylor Stadium” — brought tens of thousands of fans and friends to the banks of the Brazos.
Season ticket sales skyrocketed. Games were now sold out. At the aging Floyd Casey Stadium, albeit
home to great memories over a half century, we worked hard to fill the seats. The occasional sell-out
would occur when, say, the Longhorns came to Waco and eagerly bought up the thousands of unwanted
tickets. That was then. Now, ESPN regularly brought “Game Day” to campus, and the prevailing colors
were the beautiful gold of the Baylor Line, with shades of Baylor green sprinkled in. The optics were
even better than at green-and-gold dominated Lambeau Field in Green Bay.

And so Sam Ukwuachu came. He had traveled way north from Houston, where he had done well
enough academically in high school but whose strength and speed attracted the attention of gridiron
programs across the country. He chose national powerhouse Boise State, but he was soon unhappy and
homesick. His head football coach looked after him, thought he should be closer to home, called Coach
Briles, and soon Sam was a Baylor Bear, although he never played football at Baylor. When Sam was
charged with the unspeakably horrible act of rape, he protested his innocence and defended himself
vigorously. Devastating testimony by a former girlfriend from Boise State — who contradicted Sam’s
testimony of non-violence — likely sealed his fate. The McLennan County jury found him guilty, but then
fashioned an oddly lenient sentence — probation. As! write, Sam continues to protest his innocence, and
to seek redress in the courts. But the jury verdict stands, and Sam is thus a convicted felon.

Explosion II

Even in the best of programs horrible deeds are done. We are a fallen race. Even young men from
“good families” succumb to temptation and allow themselves to enter the darkest of dark domains. The
nationally-debated case of the Stanford swimmer, convicted of rape but given a lenient sentence, once
again brought into sharp focus the problem of interpersonal violence on and around college campuses,
and in particular, sexual assault. National statistics were frequently reported to the effect that 1 in 5
young women are sexually assaulted (or are otherwise victims of interpersonal violence) during their
college years. Sam’s case provided the jumping off point for Texas Monthly’s provocative thesis that
with all of its vaunted success, Coach Briles’ program was infected by a culture of violence against
women.

investigation refutes the allegations.”

Office of the Assistant Attomey General Washington, D.C. 20530
November 9, 2007

The Honorable John Conyers, Jr.
Chairman

Committee on the Judiciary

U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

This letter presents the views of the Department of Justice (the Department or DOJ) on
H.R. 3887, the “William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of
2007,” as introduced by Congressman Lantos on October 18, 2007, The Department has
significant concerns, which are detailed below in a section-by-section analysis. The proposed
legislation, as drafted, would eliminate the Department’s role in several important steps in the
victim identification process, and thereby negatively impact our ability to ensure the safety of
victims and their families, rescue additional victims, and apprehend and prosecute human
traffickers; it would broaden the criminal statutes regarding prosecution in a manner that detracts
from effective enforcement efforts and raises serious federalism implications; and it would
unconstitutionally intrude into Executive authority.

1. Sevtion 102

The provision in subsection (e)(2)(B) authorizing the Director of the Office to Monitor
and Combat Trafficking in Persons (G/TIP) at the Department of State to interview victims
should clarify that the Director is authorized to do so only with the consent of the Attorney
General in any case where an ongoing investigation or prosecution may exist. Otherwise,
serious issues could arise that would complicate or even scutile prosecution. For example, any
statements made to the Director would presumptively have to be turned over to the defense and
any statements that contradict statements made to law enforcement or prosecutors would be
required to be turned over to the defense.

2. Section 103

DOJ finds section 103 unnecessary and duplicative of existing efforts and, therefore,
opposes its inclusion in the bill. DOJ and other Federal agencies are already offering the types
of assistance that are described in the section. Furthermore, the new subsection (a)()(3) would
require the United States Government to provide “technical assistance to provide legal
frameworks and other programs to foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations to

toward nuclear disarmament. It will be many moons and unerringly
effective inspections before leaders in Washington and Moscow
contemplate such a course. Surely ElBaradei knows this.
Nonetheless, “The Age of Deception” provides the grist for serious
debate even as it helpfully chronicles the International Atomic
Energy Agency’s journey and tribulations as it evolved from a
relatively obscure group of technicians into an organization with
growing international clout. But if those following in ElBaradei’s
path think they can combat proliferation without the major powers —
particularly the United States — assuming a central role, they are
wrong. Checking proliferation will require more innovative and
tighter cooperation between the agency ElBaradei loves and the
United States, of which he no longer seems especially fond.

Relations, a former senior official in the State and Defense
Departments, and a former New York Times columnist.

How will levered companies react?

Companies will likely grow comfortable with a smaller amount of debt, retain more
earnings, use less cash for dividends and share buybacks, and potentially draw down
cash if they have it. If a tax holiday is also granted, that might offset the loss of benefit.
Companies that regularly issue long-term debt may choose to reduce that burden to
offset the tax change, and find those funds elsewhere. We find it unlikely that the
change would result in a surge in equity issuance, unless the change applies to existing
debt, which is unlikely in our view. While this change should be taken as a line item ina
wholistic bill, there are victims and beneficiaries here. Corporations that have high
leverage ratios, low retained earnings, high interest expense to earnings ratios, no cash
overseas offset from repatriation, and those that have recurring long-term debt needs
may be most at risk.

Other implications

While some argue that companies will try to raise outsized amounts of investment grade
capital ahead of the deadline to lock in funding with the tax benefit before the loophole
is closed, there is a reasonable chance that a provision is included in the legislation that
would treat such debt as new debt. In our Investment Grade Strategist Hans Mikkelsen’s
view, demand for IG credit could be materially reduced over time. The tax change could
also dampen Leverage Buyout (LBOQ) activity, according to our High Yield strategist
Michael Contopoulos, where these funds are already struggling to generate high returns
—note that LBO funds are currently sitting on close to $1tn in cash looking for a home,
according to Preqin’s third quarter update.

Who could be hurt: See Table 21 for a screen of stocks with high net interest
expense as a percentage of net income which could potentially be hurt most by an
end to the deductibility of interest expense.

30 November 2016 Corrected
Key takeaways
• Market response to Trump is logical but moves have been frontloaded. We now see
USD & rates only modestly higher next year.
• We see higher growth and inflation, notably in Japan. We go long NKY, stay long EM
AXJ & selective yield in equity/ credit.
• Risk is an overshoot so we stay long USD/ short rates, adding a CNH put and short
10Y real rates. CNH a hedge vs trade risk.

Trump extends some trends, starts others
In the three weeks since Donald Trump’s election victory global markets have seen some
dramatic moves. Som1e of those moves are extending trends that had already started –
higher yields, higher USD, rotation from long to short duration. Others are new – JPY
lower, NKY higher, EM lower. The key question is how much more they can go?
Growth/inflation higher in 17/18 - modest fiscal boost
Our economists think the fiscal impact of Trump will be modest at 0.5% on growth in
H2 next year. Fiscal stimulus elsewhere also to be modest but it is taking the pressure
off monetary policy. Growth was already improving so any fiscal stimulus helps. Our
economists have both growth and inflation higher into 2017 and 2018.
Inflection point in markets but much discounted already
Market moves at turning points are often violent. The task of investors is to work out
how much is already discounted. Our fixed income strategists have 10Y US yields at
2.65bp and bunds at 65bp at end 2017, also EUR/USD at 1.02 so moves look
frontloaded to us. That suggests their implications for other markets should fade.
Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com
Evolution not revolution – long NKY, short 10Y real rates
If that is the case then we do not want to make wholesale changes to our strategy. We
make two key changes today, adding long NKY (Japan strategist targets 20k) and short
10Y real rates trades. The former is part of our strategy to be pro-growth and we think
it complements our long EM Asia trade being affected differently by USD strength.
The hunt for yield is dead, long live the hunt for yield
If yields only rise modestly next year then the hunt for yield will live on. We keep a yield
basket in European equities, AT1s and spread in Euro/US credit. We go outright long
European Healthcare by lifting our Food & Beverage short, which has dropped sharply.
Overshoot in rates, USD and trade key risks – add CNH put
The world would look very different if the US 10Y blew through 3% and the USD went
on a tear, so we stay long USD and short rates. We add a CNH put vs USD as a hedge
against an escalation of trade tensions under the new Trump administration.

Themes
Long Cyclicality
• Long Asia EM – recovering growth, earnings revisions and cheap valuation.
• Long Nikkei – growth picking up, JPY soft, 20k target.
Long Yield
• Long European dividend yield stocks – 5% yield, big pick up over IG credit.
• Long Dec 18 SX5E dividend future – implies 4% drop from 2016, we see 4% rise.
• Long basket of AT1s – high yield, equity cushion to rise.
• Long XOver short Main – investors’ reach for yield to push them towards Crossover.
• Long basket of 30Y US industrial IG spreads – further spread compression.
Hedge the Fed/Trump
• 2-5-10 fly – 5Y part of the curve looks most vulnerable to Fed hiking.
• Short 10Y real yields – inflation breakevens have adjusted real rates have not.
• Long USD – long via USD/GBP and USD/AUD, we think policy divergence will drive
USD stronger if the Fed tightens as our economists expect.
• Long USD/CNH 7.6 6 month call – hedge against trade tensions
Hedge the Rest
• We are long SX5E, NKY and RTY vs SPX variance. Carry positive, convex in a sell-off.
• Long Dec 17/18 SX5E put spread. Long 3000-2850 Dec 16 put spread.
Alpha Trades
• Long European Pharma. Sector discounting no pipeline, valuation back to cheapest
since 2011. Solid yield too.
• Paying 5y UK real rates at -254bp. Implied inflation/rates inconsistent.
• Long RUB/ZAR (positive on oil, cautious on S African politics).
• Short EUR/SEK, strong Swedish growth, limiting room for Riksbank easing.
2 Global Cross Asset Strategy – Year Ahead | 30 November 2016
The Trump inflection
Changes today: Add NKY long, 10Y real rate short and CNH put, close forward
Kospi vol and Food & Beverage short. We are not making mass changes today. While
some of our trades have worked better than others post-election we are broadly happy
with the balance. We still want exposure to growth and to own yield where we can but
also want to protect ourselves from a further surge in the USD and rates.
We diversify our equity long in EM and European yield with a long Nikkei position.
It is not the best entry point but we suspect it has further to run on a one year horizon.
A stronger USD is good for Japanese equities where it is not for EM, so they
complement one another. We add a short US 10Y real rate trade too to protect
against rising US yields, as breakevens have already moved significantly. We close our
Kospi vol trade (changed view from strategists) and drop the short Food leg of our
Pharma/Food trade, reflecting the sharp sell-off in the long duration sectors of late.
Summary: Still be long growth and yield but hedge with USD and Rates
Year aheads are notoriously tricky to write and almost always wrong. Anyone who
wanted to correctly predict the outcomes and how markets would react to them in 2016
did not need so much as crystal ball as a time machine. As investors and strategists we
have to make calculations as to the most likely outcomes, where is the best upside to
play them and how best to hedge the risks around them.
Donald Trump’s election is in our view an inflection point for global markets,
starting new trends in some asset classes and extending trends in others. It does
not completely change the world though, as the disinflationary and weak growth
pressures that have plagued the world since the GFC are structural rather than cyclical.
But the shift to fiscal and populism is likely to boost growth and inflation, so it does
change the picture to a significant degree. If we are to call it an earthquake it is perhaps
a five rather than a nine on the Richter scale.
We have to adjust our way of thinking though. The rise in rates and higher USD that
we had hedged against now look like they are going to go further. That is going to
hurt longer duration assets. So we continue to run our long USD positions and add to
our short rate positions (via 10Y real rates). There is risk around trade and geopolitics,
which has to make us more nervous of our EM positions. So we diversify our risks by
pairing our long EM position with a long Japan position and add a CNH put.
But the world is not completely changing. Even in the new order we only forecast 10Y
Treasuries at 2.65% and Bund yields at 65bp end 2017. So the hunt for yield will not
disappear completely. We still want to own yield, but as we have said of late it cannot
be yield for yield’s sake. Yield in equity markets has been safest in the shortest duration
buckets, such as Banks and Cyclicals since the summer. We changed our yield basket last
month is this direction so we keep it. We stay long AT1’s and in credit we keep our
spread trades both in Europe and the US.
AND we remind investors of something we said at the start of 2016, be prepared
to trade the ranges in markets. If there was one lesson of the last year it was that.
When assets get very loved and overbought, sell them, when it is the opposite you have
to buy them. Think of buying EM and commodities in February. Think of selling
defensive equities and bonds and buying banks post-Brexit. None of us will get that
right all of the time, but the Warren Buffet maxim “be greedy when others are fearful
and fearful when others are greedy” is particularly useful in current markets.
Finally, as cross asset investors think about what can go wrong with your positions
and find asymmetric hedges for them if you can. That should be the edge you have at
looking across the range of asset classes compared to single asset class investors.
We would like to thank our BofAML colleagues who have supported our product this
year by providing many such ideas and trust they will continue to do so through 2017.
Global Cross Asset Strategy – Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 3
X Asset Strategy: Long growth, short bonds, long USD but
the hunt for yield lives on
Clearly markets are different and will continue to be so under President elect Trump
BUT not everything will change. The disinflationary forces triggered by the GFC have
not gone away but the decision to focus on fiscal stimulus, not just in the US but also
Japan and to a lesser extent the UK, is a welcome shift taking some of the burden away
from monetary policy. It means rates should be higher for any given amount of growth.
But higher does not mean a return to pre GFC levels of rates, which we need to bear in
mind when setting our strategy. Indeed, our strategists 10Y forecasts are US 2.65%,
Euro 0.65% and Japan 0% for end 2017.
Similarly on trade, for all the rhetoric of the President-elect again we do not think he
wants to trigger trade wars that would damage US growth. That means we should not
necessarily drop our pro-EM bias.
So we think of it as an evolution rather than a revolution in the way our strategy is
structured. We wanted to be exposed to growth, we tweak that by adding a NKY long to
replace our US energy long. We continue to have yield in the portfolio where we can find
it, which is through a mixture of equities and credit (AT1’s, European yield basket, Xover
v Main and US long date industrial spreads).
Even more than before we want to be protected against a stronger USD and higher
rates, hence the addition of the 10Y real yield trade, and trade tensions which we have
tried to cover through our CNH put.
Nov 8 th accelerates some trends, starts other
Before the US election we said that the tectonic plates were starting to shift, with bond
yields having troughed and starting to head higher. We thought there were signs too
that global growth might be shifting up a gear. So we wanted to have defensive
positions in bond markets, be long the USD and be long growth where we could. The
election of Donald Trump has arguably turned this gradual shifting of plates into a full
blown earthquake for global financial markets.
The key questions for investors as we look ahead to 2017 are how big an earthquake
and how much the moves that have happened since November 8 th are likely to be
extended into next year vs how much we have frontloaded them already in 2016.

The moves since Nov 8 th have certainly been violent in certain asset classes. USD/JPY
stands out, but the sell-off in US treasuries has been very marked, the hit to EM fixed
income equally big, while in equity markets the outperformance of the Russell, the surge
in the US banks and the sell-off in long duration equities has been remarkable.
Some of these moves, such as stronger USD, higher yields, banks vs staples were
extensions of moves that had already begun. Others, such as Russell vs S&P, JPY, Nikkei,
were the start of new moves where 8 Nov marked a key turning point.
The moves that had already started are now getting quite stretched with US 10Y yields
up 5 standard deviations from the July low, with US Banks up by a similar amount vs
Staples. The USD/JPY move though is more like a 2 SD move, with the NKY similar (if
we exclude the 7% drop on US election day).
Peak liquidity, deflation, inequality and globalisation – watch for Peak Trump
So what does a Trump presidency mean for the world? Michael Hartnett, our Chief
Investment Strategist sums it up nicely with four of his seven peaks. Peak liquidity –
the era of excess liquidity is over; Peak inequality – with fiscal stimulus to address
inequality; Peak globalisation- free movement of trade, labour and capital ending, FX
wars starting; and Peak deflation – the secular low point in bond yields now behind us.
We would add a peak to that which investors need to bear in mind – Peak Trump. What
we mean by that is at what point do the policy changes of the Trump presidency get
fully discounted in markets. We have moved pretty quickly to do that but we suspect
there is more to go, even if the quick returns have probably already been made.
If we think about these peak questions, the two that stand out to use as obvious and not
really open to challenge are Peak liquidity and Peak deflation. The Fed left its peak
liquidity position behind ages ago, the BOJ has moved to yield rather than liquidity
targeting, the BOE may extend its current programme of QE one more time but then is
probably done and even the ECB is talking about tapering, even if they are unlikely to do
it in December. The Peak deflation theme follows on from this with the secular low in
bond yields surely behind us if the central banks are stepping away from flooding the
world with ever more liquidity.
Peak liquidity/deflation means higher yields – inflation expectations adjusting
The question then is how much yields will likely rise from here. Much of course depends
on how quickly inflation picks up. Markets have already moved to price in a significant
pick-up in expected inflation as the two charts below show. To our mind breakeven
inflation rates had been too low for too long, which is one reason we wanted to be
defensive in bond markets. It would seem to us that inflation expectations are now up
with events. US headline CPI at 2.5% is consistent with the Fed modestly overshooting
Global Cross Asset Strategy – Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 5
its 2% core PCE target. Our economists think that the Fed may well aim a little high in
the short term on inflation to ensure they have sufficient room to ease in the event of a
downturn. However, it is unlikely that the Fed would tolerate a sustained overshoot of
their inflation objective. That is particularly the case if the Fed under President Trump is
made more hawkish as our economists think it probably will be (see Liquid Insight:
Trump’s stamp on the FOMC).

Equally, our economists in Europe are sceptical on the ECB’s ability to get inflation to
rise significantly from current levels. Optically there is scope for European breakevens
to head higher if the ECB were to be successful but investors are likely to want to see
some evidence of rising inflation first before they price that in. We will return to this
below. For now we agree with our fixed income strategists that the rise in inflation
expectations is probably sufficient and that any rise in yields from here has to be one of
higher real yields.
They think such a rise as a tightening of monetary conditions which may be self-limiting
in the short term, particularly as the fiscal boost in the US is likely to be back loaded in
terms of 2017. If rates move too quickly and the USD follows before the fiscal stimulus
kicks in they could actually dampen growth. Indeed, our US economists have shaved
their near term growth forecasts already to reflect the current moves. They do not
expect the fiscal stimulus to start to boost growth before the 3 rd quarter.
Fiscal + hawkish Trump Fed means we stay short 5Y US via 2-5-10 butterfly
Our fixed income team estimated how much fair values of the different parts of the
curve would have to move were the market to move into line with the dot plot. Updating
those estimates for the move since their publication we find 2Y rates can move another
11bp, 5Y 39bp and 10Y 33bp. They argue that given we are past the inflection point for
rates, with fiscal policy being eased and now with a more hawkish Fed under Trump
likely, the dot plot should form the floor not the ceiling for rate expectations. All of this
translates into a view that 10Y yields can push to 2.65% by the second half of 2017.
Given their views on the curve we continue to run the 2-5-10 butterfly. It has moved
from around -10bp to +10bp since the election, and our fixed income strategists have
moved their target to +20bp.

Peak globalization/inequality means higher real rates – short 10Y US real rates
Our fixed income team make the point that globalization has been a driving force behind
lower real rates as it has been good for EM growth and reserves. Those reserves then
found their way back into the US holding real rates lower. They argue that as the global
savings glut unwinds real rates have room to re-price. Peak inequality also means an
unwind of globalization as politicians seek to protect workers from the depressing
effect on wages coming from overseas. Donald Trump has already said he intends to
charge China with being a currency manipulator. Whether he does or not and what
action he takes to accompany it remains to be seen, but artificially low currencies
generating high current account surpluses are unlikely to go down well with the new
administration. That lends weight to the fixed income team’s arguments.
Peak inequality may also mean less migration across the world – think Trump’s
arguments on illegal immigration from Mexico and Theresa May’s desire to limit
migration into the UK post Brexit. Less migration likely means more upward pressure on
wages, which is the inflation expectations side of the argument. But Michael Hartnett
also thinks it means more action on fiscal policy. The UK government have implemented
a £24bn infrastructure fund in the Autumn statement. Donald Trump wants to trigger up
to $1tn of infrastructure spending in the US in addition to the tax cuts.
The fiscal boost should push real rates higher (at least in the short term). Some Fed
members have acknowledged this suggesting that equilibrium interest rate might be
moved higher by fiscal stimulus. The rates team also rightly says while they want to be
bearish rates given the speed of the move so far it is also right not to be foolish. Given
how much inflation expectations have moved they think there is better risk reward in
real rates. They argue the 10Y real rate is the most vulnerable to further moves higher in
rates. Although they have already risen from around zero in the summer to ~50bp now
they think 10Y real rates can reach 1%. So we add that trade to our 2-5-10s position.
Implications for other asset classes: Stronger USD, weaker EM?
The forces impacting on markets from the Trump victory have not been confined to
rates markets, although it is probably fair to say that most (although certainly not all) of
the impact stems from the move in rates. Higher US rates have meant a stronger USD,
an outperformance of short duration over long duration equities, a hit to EM debt and all
forms of carry trades.

The USD is a case in point, with the higher US rates creating a significant gap to
equivalent Euro and JPY rates. With the ECB likely to extend QE by the full current
amount (despite the debate over timing) and the BOJ committed to capping JGB yields
at zero, a surge higher in the USD was the logical outcome. Given that the biggest gap
in intentions was relative to Japan it is perhaps not surprising that the JPY has been the
biggest victim, with the JPY falling some 10% against the USD since the election. The
DXY has broken out of the top end of the trading range it has been in since early 2014.
The stronger USD is not just reliant on higher yields, but also other factors such as the
likely repatriation of money into the US under a new proposal for US corporates to
return funds at a concessionary tax rate, generally referred to as HIA2.
We had positioned long USD as well as short rates, not so much as an explicit play on a
Trump victory but more against a more hawkish Fed in 2017. We were also of the view
though that a Trump win would likely be positive for the USD and higher yields. Going
back to our fixed income strategists’ point that the dot plot should now perhaps be the
base case for the markets that does imply higher yields which should continue to be
dollar supportive. Like their bond yield forecasts though our strategists call for a
modest further appreciation of the USD rather than a huge surge. They have the USD
peaking at 1.02 vs the EUR, 120 against the JPY and 1.43 vs the CAD.
So the big violent move has likely happened even if we still see the USD strengthening
further next year. Certainly our FX strategists are not calling for a surge in the USD
similar to the one that happened in 2014/15.
The reaction of the US economy to “Trumponomics” is key
These two things are important for other asset classes. If we really thought 10Y
Treasuries were heading to 3%, the Fed likely to tighten above the dot plot and the USD
to surge another 10% in quick order, the impact on other asset classes would likely be
more severe. That would undoubtedly exacerbate the trends we have seen out of EM
and long duration equities. We also suspect it would make it much harder for
commodities to perform. We see holding USD and short rates positions as necessary to
hedge against such an outcome with limited downside risk if it does not happen.

Nevertheless it is not our central scenario in part because there is a risk that much of a
Trump surge could be bad for growth. As we noted above the fiscal stimulus is likely to
be back loaded as far as 2017 is concerned. In the meantime the FX and Rates teams
predict an 8-10% appreciation of the USD from pre-election levels and 10Y rates about
80bp higher. Our economists note that a 10% appreciation of the USD is estimated to
slice around 0.5% off of US GDP growth over two years. Higher mortgage rates from
higher bond yields would also likely dampen growth. As a result, they have actually
lowered their forecast for US growth in the first half of next year to around 1.5% before
seeing it rebound to around 2.3% in H2 and then 2.5% in 2018 as the fiscal stimulus
feeds through.
Various Fed members, notably Bill Dudley of the NY Fed, have said this year that a
stronger USD would have an impact on monetary policy. So to some extent we see USD
strength as self-limiting as it would start to lower the profile of likely Fed tightening.
Our economists are also cautious as to the extent of the impact of the Trump fiscal
plans. Assuming that there is a compromise between the Trump administration and
Congress our economists think the likely scale of tax cuts is $2-3tn over 10 years, with
$200-300bn of this in 2017. Given the low estimated multiplier from any proposed tax
cuts and a Congress likely to limit the amount of an increase in government spending,
they look for a modest 0.5% boost to growth.
Upside risk to growth and rates if Trump does more on fiscal, less on trade
If Congress passes more of the Trump stimulus plan, particularly on the infrastructure
side, and there are no significant changes to trade or immigration policies then our US
economists think growth could potentially hit 3% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018. That would
likely be accompanied by a faster pace of Fed hikes than they currently assume (which is
two hikes between now and end 2017 followed by 3 in 2018).
Trade policy and its impact vital
The other key factor of the new administration is going to be the direction on trade.
President elect Trump has already said he will pull out of the TPP, TTIP looks likely to
get the same treatment, while NAFTA is set to be renegotiated. Meantime Trump said
he will label China a currency manipulator. This is the other side of the Peak
Globalisation/Peak Inequality coin and none of it looks good for global trade. Combined
with the stronger USD and higher rates, it is easy to understand the knee jerk reaction
of investors to sell EM asset, particularly given the gains of earlier this year.

The question for investors is whether Trump the candidate or Trump the deal making
businessman will eventually be the driver behind trade policy. It is not impossible to
imagine the President-elect gaining some concessions from his hard line stance and
then claiming victory. After all, since one of his aims is to get the US economy growing
at 4% a year, a prosperous global economy to export into is probably preferable to one
that is taking a hit from an aggressive US trade policy. That is the inclination of our EM
strategists and economists, so they are expecting the reality to be softer than the
rhetoric.
At this stage we have to acknowledge that it is little more than an educated guess. It
makes us less certain of our long EM equity position than we were. Nevertheless, we
had already switched it out of an MSCI position into an Asia ex Japan in part because of
US election risks and our strategists are particularly upbeat about Asian markets. They
think they are cheap, they are positive on China and they think growth and hence
earnings will surprise on the upside.
What about the rest of the world? Growth has been improving
Growth indicators have been improving around the world of late. Data since the US
election would seem to support that with the PMIs in the Euro Area improving again and
their equivalent in the US sustaining the gains seen last month. Our EM indicators
remain robust and our China ACT indicator continues to indicate steady growth there
too.
Our economists forecast 3.5% global GDP growth with EM growth around 4.7%. Our
Euro Area growth numbers have been nudged back up towards 1 ½% with Brexit not
proving to be as much of a drag as feared. We still expect the UK economy to see
something of a slowdown in 2017 as the lagged effect of the fall in the pound hits
consumer incomes. Perhaps our most optimistic view of the world, relative to
consensus, comes from Japan where with fiscal policy turning more supportive (we put
the package at 1.5% of GDP) we see growth at 1.4% in 2017.

It is a decent global growth picture and it is not impossible to imagine it being still
better should the US surprise on the upside and the impact on trade from a Trump
presidency prove to be modest.
It certainly fits with the Peak Deflation theme since this stronger growth is expected to
be accompanied by a pick-up in inflation. We have core PCE in the US reaching 1.9%
next year in our core scenario. Our headline inflation numbers are higher because of the
expected increase in the oil price from our commodity strategists. Indeed with oil
expected to reach $60pb (OPEC permitting) headline CPI inflation in the US could push
3%. In the Euro Area we see headline inflation rising to 1.2%, albeit with core inflation
only nudging modestly higher. UK inflation is expected to move markedly higher care of
the lower pound, again with headline inflation pushing towards 3%. In Japan driven by
our more optimistic view of the economy we project core CPI at 1%.

Politics – does populism strike again, this time in Europe?
Few would have predicted both Brexit and a Trump win in 2016. Both had something to
do with the Peak Inequality and Peak Globalisation themes. Politicians on both sides of
the Atlantic tapped into a deep disquiet, particularly amongst white male blue collar
voters that they were not benefitting from this new globalised world. If opinion polls are
to be believed (something which we have all learnt to question) then Italy may well end
the year with another vote against the governing party - although that one is perhaps a
little more complicated to dissect. We recently added a put spread on the eurostoxx to
hedge against such a bad outcome here, which would be the case if it is perceived to be
Global Cross Asset Strategy – Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 11
supportive of the 5 star movement or threatened the recapitalisation of the Italian
banks (see Strategy Insights: Italy risks elevated).
In 2017 the focus turns to core Europe, especially France and Germany. Because of the
winner takes all system in France we find investors are more concerned with the
situation there. Marine Le Pen and the Front National look likely to make it to the
second round of voting (again according to polls) and until the vote comes in we suspect
investors will be cautious about European markets. A Le Pen victory could likely bring
the future of the EU and the Euro into question as she has talked about France
withdrawing from both. That in turn has arguably the potential to be even more of an
earthquake for the world’s financial markets. Our central case is that centre right
President is elected in France (with Francois Fillon now the official Republican
candidate) and Merkel is returned at the head of a coalition government in Germany.

Were this to be the case then we think there may well be room for a significant relief
rally in European assets. Until then we think it likely investors will demand a higher risk
premium.
Brexit was the big political topic for Europe going into 2016. Going forward we see it as
an ongoing issue but mostly for the UK. The political uncertainty is likely to be extended,
even after Article 50 is triggered as any significant negotiations probably need to await
the outcome of the French and German elections. We expect the UK economy to
struggle as the lagged effect of the fall in the currency hurts consumers and while there
may be contrarian trades available in the GBP during 2017, our strategists think it goes
lower first on the triggering of Article 50.

X Asset Trade Ideas
Rates – short 5Y US nominal and 10Y real rates, short 5Y UK
real rates
As discussed above on the rates side we keep our 2-5-10’s butterfly but add a 10Y short
real rates trade, to reflect the view of our fixed strategists that if yields are to go higher
then real rates will need to move. So we will not repeat the analysis here.

The other fixed income trade we continue to like is short 5Y UK real rates. The market
continues to discount the Bank of England consistently overshooting its inflation target
without a response on monetary policy. Yet Governor Carney and other members of the
BOE’s MPC have said that while they are willing to look through a short term inflation
shock they would not tolerate a sustained overshoot.
The market therefore is pricing something which suggests that the BOE will sacrifice its
credibility on the inflation side to (presumably) support growth. We would rather take
the side of the Bank in this situation. It is worth bearing in mind too that those on the
right of the Conservative party who have been critical of Governor Carney and the BOE
have tended to want higher not lower short rates. When the PM and Chancellor have to
replace the Governor at the end of 2018 it is unlikely that they are going to choose
someone more dovish.
FX – long USD, short GBP, AUD, CNH
We have been long USD since August believing the risk reward to be skewed in favour
of a stronger currency because we saw more room for the Fed to tighten than other
central banks. Given the fiscal stimulus expected from the new administration the risks
on that tightening profile have been skewed to the upside. We think the FX and Fixed
Income strategists are right to think of the dot plot as a floor now for markets. With
yields still needing to move higher to get there that should put further upward pressure
on the USD. The scope for gains though depends on the currency. The Euro is already
just 3.5% from the target for next year whereas both the GBP and the JPY have about 7-
8% to fall to our FX team’s targets. The team also continue to like short AUD positions
as they think this also captures risk off in the event of concerns over China.
Whilst the short GBP has only worked modestly since the US election, we continue to
think Brexit uncertainties will weigh on the currency into 2017 and our FX strategists
target 1.15 in the aftermath of the article 50 decision.

Today we add a CNH put (expressed as a USD/CNH call at 7.6 strike) partly because it
fits with our positive USD call but also because it is a potential hedge against the trade
rhetoric of the new administration descending into something more meaningful. Given
the stated intent to declare the Chinese as currency manipulators and the concern that
our currency strategists already have about the amount of reserves the Chinese hold, it
is not impossible to imagine a much weaker CNY/CNH should the Chinese authorities
allow a free float. We see this as a sensible hedge against our long EM equity position.

We have two other standalone currency trades, short EUR/SEK and long RUB/ZAR. The
former has dropped as the EUR has weakened against the USD. We continue to think
that the Swedish economy is more robust than the Eurozone and that the Riksbank will
sooner or later have to adjust monetary policy accordingly. We see a lot more room for
this pair to move in 2017, particularly if there are political concerns ahead of the French
presidential elections as these will likely weigh on the EUR.
RUB/ZAR has been quite erratic since we re-established the trade, reflecting both
volatility in the oil price and developments in South African politics. The latest no
confidence vote against President Zuma underlines how tricky South African politics are
at the moment. Concerns will remain on the economic progress of the country until the
political situation becomes clearer. In the meantime we expect a higher risk premium to
be associated with the currency.
14 Global Cross Asset Strategy – Year Ahead | 30 November 2016
Equities: Add long Nikkei to EM Asia
Global equity markets have gone in very different directions post the US election. EM
have fared worst, Europe little changed, S&P at new all-time highs, the Russell and
Nikkei on a tear higher. This is not how we were positioned so we need to ask the
question of whether and what we need to change.

If we stand back from the noise and just look at the valuations, the US is the most
expensive, MSCI Asia ex the cheapest in absolute terms. Our strategists see decent
earnings growth likely to come through in EM Asia, and while there is upside to US
earnings estimates from potential corporate tax cuts at least part of it is priced in.
Savita Subrahamian has a target for the US of 2300 in her year ahead Euphoria or fiscal
fizzle?, an upside of a less than 5%. Our European strategists have an upside of around
6%. So that leaves EM Asia and Japan (given our 20k target) as the stand outs according
to our equity strategists. Indeed, the PE of Japan is towards the bottom end of the
range since 2000.
Sticking with EM Asia
One of our concerns on EM was a more hawkish Fed and therefore a stronger USD. So
we regarded our positions in those asset classes as something of a hedge to our EM
positions. As we explained above we are keeping that stance as on our central scenario
there is more to go and on a risk scenario where bond markets overshoot the USD is
likely to follow.
In the equity world, if our fixed income and FX forecasts are right, then we do not see
them as being an impediment to our EM Asia position working again. Our EM strategists
remain upbeat and Ajay Kapur actually upgraded his call to buy from a tactical pause
post the election (A Call to Action: Time to BUY Asia/EMs). They think the right focus is
one on growth rather than the USD and we continue to be upbeat on the prospects for
EM growth, particularly in Asia. Ajay in particular makes the point that Chinese nominal
GDP growth has been accelerating and that tends to be very good for Asian equity
markets. Nigel Tupper’s global wave has continued to improve and he argues that
remains consistent with strong performance from Asia ex Japan equities.

The question then is whether the strong USD or trade tensions from the new Trump
administration can outweigh the more positive macro backdrop. We are inclined to back
the view of our strategists and think that it will, so we are sticking with our long EM
Asia position. We are doing so with hedges via a long USD and a CNH put.
Long Nikkei: target 20,000
We had previously paired our long EM position with a long US oil equity position, but
with our US strategists downgrading the sector ahead of OPEC we removed it earlier
this week. We were therefore looking for another pro-growth trade to run alongside our
EM position. Long Japanese equities seemed the logical place to look. While we
acknowledge we have missed the lows and that today’s entry point may not be ideal, we
suspect investors are not particularly long Japan yet since it was still showing as
modestly underweight in the last Fund Manager Survey.

Our Japanese equity and FX strategist Shusuke Yamada has been arguing for a while
that we would see both a weaker JPY and a rebound in Japanese equities. While arguably
the JPY had turned beforehand, the Trump victory turbo charged the move. As the chart
shows below Japanese equities do well historically during a period of bear steepening of
the US yield curve. Our economists are also more upbeat on Japan thinking the weaker
USD, the new policy stance of the BOJ and the fiscal stimulus will push growth and
inflation higher next year.
16 Global Cross Asset Strategy – Year Ahead | 30 November 2016
The combination of these factors suggest Japanese equities have further to run. We also
see the position as being complementary to our EM position since whereas a stronger
USD is a drag on EM performance, it is beneficial for the NKY position.

Long Europe equities via yield stocks & index dividends
We continue to run two yield related trades in European equities. First, we remain long a
broad selection of high yielding European equities. The dividend yield on offer in
European equities is one of the asset class’s key attractions. Europe offers a higher
dividend yield than the other regions, with a 1.1% yield pick-up versus the DM average
and 0.9% against EM equities. Those also look attractive relative to history: Europe’s
yield spread to DM ranks at the 87 th percentile of the 20-year range. Europe’s DY also
looks attractive relative to sovereign and corporate bonds despite the recent sell off in
fixed income markets: the yield pick-up relative to investment grade corporates is still
289bp. Given the concerns over European politics we prefer yield based strategies in
Europe to those looking for capital appreciation at least in the short term.

European Yield Screen
The rising rates backdrop has left yield not quite as scarce as it has been, but we
continue to think investors should own yield where they can get it at decent value, such
as in European equities. Last month we recommended investors rotate out of lower risk
Global Cross Asset Strategy – Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 17
defensive dividend stocks to take advantage of the improving cyclical backdrop and
rising bond yields. That meant our November screen included a high proportion of
Financials. This somewhat remains the case but we note the addition of several
industrial companies in our latest screen. As a reminder, to qualify the stock must be
SXXP listed stocks with at least €2bn market cap, 4% DY, 1.2x DPS cover, 0% DPS 2YR
CAGR and qualifying stocks must be on a Buy rating from our fundamental analysts. The
yield on the basket is 5% with an average DPS CAGR of 7% and 1.8x covered.

Long SX5E 2018 Index dividend futures
With our second dividend related trade, we remain long SX5E 2018 index dividend
futures (DEDZ8), a trade where we continue to see value even with the future price
trading close to the high for the year. The 2018 contract implies a 4% decline in
dividends paid from the 2016 level. In the absence of a recession, we think that is too
pessimistic – 2013 was the last year to see a material 2-year decline in dividends (in the
wake of the sovereign crisis and recession). The 2018 contract also still trades at a
discount to the level implied by our stock analysts’ DPS forecasts. Our derivative
strategists using BofAML forecasts for 2018 estimate 8% upside from current prices.
Although the upside is now more limited the risk around this trade is also much lower
now. The pull to par effect will become the dominant driver over the coming months and
the full year results should provide clarity on where the 2018 contract will settle.

European equities: switch to outright long Healthcare
We switch our European sector pair trade preferring Healthcare over Food & Beverage
into an outright long in Healthcare. Both sectors have suffered versus the market from
the rotation out of defensives and bond proxies. That has reduced the valuation of the
Food & Beverage sector to less extreme levels. Meanwhile Healthcare looks very
attractively valued and we see compelling risk reward in the sector on an outright basis
at current levels.
The fundamental bull case for Health rests on the strong pipeline of new products for
the big cap pharma universe. Our sector analysts forecast EU Pharma to deliver a 2018-
21E EPS CAGR of 11%, up from mid-single digit levels in recent years. Historically that
would justify a PE re-rating and a multiple for the pharma sub-sector nearer 17-18x
than the current 13x 2018 PE.

We believe the Republican clean sweep in the US elections represents a positive
catalyst as it significantly decreases the potential for legislative initiatives to
aggressively control drug pricing in the US. The catalyst for the sector to re-rate will
come progressively from newsflow around new products. The next 12 months should
see progress on this front with several of the European large caps expected to announce
key data on important drugs in 2017.
Global Cross Asset Strategy – Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 19
Healthcare’s forward PE is now down to just a 7% premium relative to the market and
nearing the valuation lows recorded in 2010-12 when the patent cliff was at its worst
and pipelines were very weak. Today pipelines are twice the size they were in 2011 and
innovation is the key to growth in the sector - pricing power remains strong in drug
categories with differentiated products.
Credit: Long Spreads in Europe and US
Europe: Long Xover short Main
Rate cuts are off the table it seems, as central banks are starting to recognise the side
effects of NIRP. This reinforces our view that a continuation of CSPP, entails that the
reach for yield will extend to those assets that have not seen it yet; long Crossover vs
iTraxx Main.
The beta outperformance has already started in the cash market. We look at synthetics
and we see that Crossover has not mirrored that performance. Even though XO has
outperformed recently, it still has further to go to close the gap vs cash market’s
performance.
Ioannis Angelakis thinks that rising political risks in the following twelve months are
more likely to weigh on iTraxx Main performance than Crossover, as Main has higher
concentration vs XO on names domiciled in countries with elections.
Buy 30y US IG Industrial spreads
US high-grade is the market our colleagues in Credit Strategy are most bullish into
2017. Hans Mikkelsen thinks IG corporate spread maturity curves super-flatten as global
credit investors do the twist - i.e. sell shorter maturities and buy the long end. Foreign
inflows are now concentrated in the back-end, as credit spreads have rallied while the
cost of currency hedging increased. That means that only the back end of the steep US
corporate spread curve offers enough spread to overcome the high cost of currency
hedging. The flip side is that the front end of the US credit spread curve is very
unattractive and we expect domestic and foreign investors to accelerate their selling of
shorter maturity US corporate bonds. Overall, Hans expects the 30yr corporate bond
part of the market to generate 8%-9% total returns next year.

Long AT1s basket
Contingent capital continues to offer a compelling premium to European HY and lower
volatility than bank equity. The asset class also received a boost last week when the
European Commission submitted a proposal for AT1 coupons to be prioritized over
common dividends and bonuses if the bank breaches its combined buffer. This placates
one of the main concerns investors have, i.e. that banks could decide to skip a coupon
payment but maintain their dividend. The confirmation of the role of AT1s in Pillar 2
capital is another example of regulators providing clarity on how contingent capital fits
within the overall capital structure. The main short term risk for the trade is the fate of
the Italian banks recap, so we will be watching closely to see how that develops.

Volatility: Sticking with Relative trades
While 2016 started off with a bang volatility wise it has ended with a whimper. Neither
Brexit nor the US presidential election proved to be anything more than a blip. Realised
vol in the S&P 500 over the last 100 days is just 9.5%. That compares to 13.6% for the
Eurostoxx 15.1% for the Russell and 21.8% for the NKY.

That is why we prefer relative variance trades. They tend to carry flat to positive but
have convexity to the downside. We are happy to continue to run these trades into 2017
and then use shorter term instruments to hedge specific events.
We did this around Brexit and have recently bought a 3000-2850 Eurostoxx put spread
to hedge our European exposure around the Italian referendum. While a No vote is
expected we are not sure what the aftermath will look like and there is considerable
uncertainty over the bank recapitalization of the banks afterwards.
We also have a calendar put spread in eurostoxx which tends to pay off best around the
2500-2600 levels so that remains something that we will look to keep for now given
downside risks in Europe over the first half of next year.
One trade we are taking off today is our Kospi forward vol position. We had held that as
a hedge against a China hard landing. Our derivative strategists no longer like it and we
have no opted for a currency hedge for our China risk, as discussed above.

Risks to trades
Equity trades
• The risks to long divi basket & Pharma trades are a steepening of rates curves and
better than expected growth outside of Europe causing investors to rotate out of
bond proxies. Plus our analysts’ expectations of improved earnings from the
healthcare pipeline not coming through.
• The risks to trade dividend future trade is lower than expected profits for major
European sectors, e.g. Banks, Oils, causing a correction in dividend expectations.
• The risk to EM Asia ex-Japan is from a stronger USD and faster than expected US
rates hiking cycle. Trade tensions with the new US administration an additional risk
now.
• Risk to long Nikkei trade is a reversal of JPY weakness or a change in policy by the
BOJ.
Fixed income trades
• The risks to the US rates trades are a dovish Fed responding to a tightening of
monetary conditions before the fiscal boost kicks in. Disappointment on the fiscal
stimulus also a risk. The risk to the UK inflation trade is that the BoE doesn’t
respond to expected rising inflation by raising rates faster.
• The risks to the Industrial spreads trade is a deterioration of US industrial growth
and step away from credit purchasing by ECB/ BoE.
• The risks the AT1 trade are the ECB pulling out of the credit markets causing a
correction in the riskier portion of the market and bank profitability deteriorating
raising concerns about default.
• The risks to our XOVER trade are Eurozone growth disappointing and a risk-off
event in markets causing a flight to quality amongst credit investors.
Volatility trades
• Our equity vol trades are hedges, the risks are that they expire worthless due to the
lack of a financial event in China and persistent low vol spread in equity markets
supported by higher growth.
FX trades
• The main risk to our FX trades is of a more dovish than expected Fed, a more
hawkish than expected BOE, improved politics in South Africa/weaker oil price and
a more dovish Riksbank.

Appendix 1: Methodology
This publication is aimed at multi-asset institutional investors who tend to have a longer
term time horizon for their investments. As such, we will be looking to come up with
ideas that will have a minimum six month horizon and ideally longer than a year. The
individual trade ideas will be sourced from our strategists across BofA Merrill Lynch
Global Research.
This publication is not meant to be an agglomeration of all the trade ideas published by
BofAML Global Research strategists, but instead represents those that fit with our
longer term themes (as opposed to shorter term tactical trades). In addition, there may
be several different trade ideas published by BofAML Global Research strategists across
different asset classes that seek to leverage off of the same theme. In most cases we
will seek merely to take the trades that have the best risk adjusted return. By risk
adjusted we mean the risk undertaken in a trade vs the likely return on that trade. In
considering that we will look at the underlying volatility in the individual asset class. This
will be combined with our own view of what the likely downside is in an adverse
scenario vs the payoff in the expected scenario and our own assessment of the
likelihoods of such scenarios.
Once selected it is assumed that the trade would likely be retained for a minimum of six
months (as per the selection rationale). Should any analyst change their view on the trade
and cease to recommend it, then it will be immediately removed from our list 1 . Equally
should our target be met for a trade and the relevant strategist feels it has run its course
then it will also be removed (see footnote). Otherwise we will review our trades on a
monthly basis in this publication. If we feel a new trade idea has a better risk adjusted
return than an existing one in the same asset class then we would replace it.
The objective of the trades is that they would be suitable for a typical objective of the
multi-asset fund managers, which is typically framed in terms of a Libor+ benchmark
(this can be anything from Libor +300bp to Libor +700bp). That return is also coupled
with a target volatility, for example half MSCI ACWI volatility. The volatility target will,
of course, be a function of the expected return, but there is a general focus on
producing lower volatility returns. Our set of trades should not be regarded as a
portfolio but a collection of ideas to implement in a multi-asset portfolio.

Options Risk Statement
Potential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk
Unlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by
definition governed by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with
general options trading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment
risk... all of which can occur in a short period.
Investor suitability
The use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are
considered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are
encouraged to become familiar with the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized
Options (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult
with a FINRA Registered Options Principal.

Disclosures
Important Disclosures
FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).
Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*
Buy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%
Neutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%
Underperform N/A ≥ 20%
* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.
INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays
no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s
coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.

"
IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031252.txt,"° In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates.

° In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner.

° Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without
mentioning you by name. “There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me
upset for weeks afterward,” she wrote.

° She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you,
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and
she did.

° University investigators interviewed both you and the student.

° On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university’s associate vice president for student
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told:
“This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university’s sexual harassment
policy.”

° The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she
remained at Case.

° The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics
department before setting foot on the campus again.

° The letter also stated, “Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with
students.”

° By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the
month before.

° “The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,”
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008.

Incident 3:

° A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her.

Incident 4:

° You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic.

° During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student
and volunteers for Dawkins’ foundation.

° Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink.

° You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go.
° You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, lowa, in April 2011.

° You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the
table.

° She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She

crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away.

that’s one of the fuels of this populist revolt that we’re seeing as the tea party. So I think
there are many, many measures, particularly about getting the banks on better footing,
making them address all the liquid assets they have. I think you need a real clean-up of
the banks balance sheets.

In addition, I think you really need to go back and make banks do what they do:
Commercial banks lend money, and investment banks invest in entrepreneurs and to get
away from this trading — you know, the hedge fund securitization, which they’ve all
become basically trading operations and securitizations and not put capital back and
really grow businesses and to grow the economy. So I think it’s a whole area that just —
and I will tell you, the underpinning of this populist revolt is the financial crisis of 2008.
That revolt, the way that it was dealt with, the way that the people who ran the banks and
ran the hedge funds have never really been held accountable for what they did, has fueled
much of the anger in the tea party movement in the United States.

Questioner: Thank you.

Bannon: Great question.

Questioner: Hello, Mr. Bannon. I’m Mario Fantini, a Vermonter living in Vienna,
Austria. You began describing some of the trends you're seeing worldwide, very
dangerous trends, worry trends. Another movement that I’ve been seeing grow and
spread in Europe, unfortunately, is what can only be described as tribalist or neo-nativist
movement — they call themselves Identitarians. These are mostly young, working-class,
populist groups, and they’re teaching self-defense classes, but also they are arguing
against — and quite effectively, I might add — against capitalism and global financial
institutions, etc. How do we counteract this stuff? Because they're appealing to a lot of
young people at a very visceral level, especially with the ethnic and racial stuff.

Bannon: I didn’t hear the whole question, about the tribalist?

“One of the committees in Congress said to the Justice Department, 35 [bank] executives,
I believe, that they should have criminal indictments against — not one of those has ever
been followed up on.”

the fact that good people are capable of horrific things: the banality of evil. Hiding behind every average
Joe is a person equipped with an engine of malice. Banality is the veil of evil. Thus, the American
psychologist Stanley Milgram showed that normal people were capable of shocking innocent others when
an authority figure told them to do so; of course, there were no shocks, but the subjects believed they
were real. Similarly, the American psychologists Solomon Asch and Philip Zimbardo showed that
normal people followed group attitudes and instructions, bleating like mindless sheep, no reflection, no
critical thinking, no concern about the consequences of their actions. In Zimbardo’s study — the famous
Stanford prison experiments — run of the mill undergraduates playing the role of prison guards turned
into little dictators, mentally and physically abusing their run of the mill undergraduates playing the role
of prisoners. Together, these studies seemed to support a blank slate view of the mind, a tablet waiting for
inscription by the local culture, with no constraints on the written matter.

A closer look at many of these studies reveals far more variation in how individuals responded,
suggesting that differences in their genetic make-up and personal experience either facilitated their
willingness to follow authority and ideology or prevented it. Many subjects in both the Milgram and
Zimbardo studies refused to follow the orders or rules of the game. Those who refused tended to identify
more with the victim and less with the authority figure or ideology. This suggests important differences in
the capacity to experience empathy and compassion for another. Studies by the cognitive neuroscientist
Esse Viding show that by the pre-school years, some children have a diminished capacity for empathy,
expressing a deeply callous and unemotional character. These children exhibit severe conduct problems,
especially violence. These children lack remorse and an awareness of others’ distress. They are cold,
heartless kids. If they have a twin, they are more likely to share this callous-unemotional personality than
two unrelated children, revealing the trademark of a powerful genetic engine. More boys than girls fall on
the high end of this callous-unemotional scale — where high translates to colder and more callous. Those
who score highest on the scale engage in more direct physical bullying than those who score lower. High
scorers lack the skills to modulate their behavior following direct or anticipated punishment. These
individuals also show reduced activity in the amygdala, a part of the brain that is critically involved in
regulating emotion, especially the assignment of a positive or negative value on our actions and
experiences. These individual differences persist into adulthood. These are the kind of individual
differences that can explain why some followed Milgram and Zimbardo’s instructions to perfection, while

others resisted, exerting self-control.

by Vicky Ward <http://www.vanityfair. com/contributors/vicky-  ward> 
March 8, 2011, 2:30 PM 
I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You will 
never think the same way about anything again. 
So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at 
the moment as the alleged procurer of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of 
another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations 
that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have 
zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his 
old pal. 
I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called The Talented Mr. Epstein. It was largely a business piece that focused 
on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the 
chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is 
currently serving a 2o-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with 
whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that 
remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on 
the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And 
their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about 
Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored 
of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight 
—that I have decided to write about this myself. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030584 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running 
into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with 
him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. Do they speak? I remember asking him once, nodding 
at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. Not like you,Vicky, was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't 
studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home 
via messenger. It was a book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was 
certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments 
in his company and you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that Andy 
—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. 
Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking about far 
more than Andy does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours talking 
to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has 
spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish 
there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs'. She is 
very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close 
friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, 
(known fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes 
down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. 
And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement 
for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but 
then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive black hole he'd 
fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people 
in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved 
countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't tend to get to the top 
by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't quite manage a normal life 
—whatever that is. He had a second wife for many years whose existence he has been open about. 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty 
to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at Waksal 
and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of
