Jeffrey Epstein: July 2009

effrey Epstein walks out of the Stockade on July 21, 2009,

having served less than thirteen months of his eighteen-month

: sentence. One of the concessions his lawyers have gotten

while working out his plea-deal guarantees is that the media not

_ be alerted to the time and day of his departure.

_ But from now on, Epstein, who is fifty-six, will carry the
mark of a level 3 sex offender—level 1 being the lowest, and

 level 3 indicating the highest possible risk of a future criminal

“act of a sexual nature. Wherever he goes, he will be forced to reg-

“ister as such.

_ Every ninety days, Epstein will have to check in with the

authorities. Every year, the New York City Police Department

Will take his mug shot. And for a full year, Epstein will be under

House arrest in Palm Beach.
| This last prohibition doesn’t stop him from flying, with court
