MR. SIMPSON: The flash drive is the same
as the document production.
MR. SCAROLA: So the answer is no, they're
not there; is that correct?
MR. SIMPSON: Correct.
MR. SCAROLA: Okay. And what's the
explanation for that?
MR. SIMPSON: I'm not going to debate this
on the record with you, Mr. Scarola.
MR. SCAROLA: All right. Thank you.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Which conversation with Rebecca did you
tape record?

A. I tape recorded a conversation with her
permission where she told me that she was pressured,
she didn't -- where Rebecca told me that Virginia
was pressured and that she didn't want to name me
but she was pressured to name me, that she had never
previously named me.

By the way, | told this to Virginia

Roberts! lawyer.

MS. McCAWLEY: Objection. To the extent
you're going to reveal anything that was said
during settlement discussions, I’m moving for
sanctions, period. We're not doing this today.

A. Iknow what you know because I'm a logical
person and I know that Virginia -- I know that
Virginia Roberts repeatedly called this -- this
woman and her husband, repeatedly text her, and
knows her name. And you and Virginia Roberts'
lawyers are operating in privity here. You're
whispering to each other, you're passing notes. You
are part of a joint legal team.

And if you want to know her name, all you
have to do is ask Sigrid McCawiley and she'll tell
you her name. I'm sure you know her name. And if
you don't know her name, it's because you haven't
asked.

. Okay. Well, I'm asking you ~
. I'm not going to tell you --
. and I'm telling you I don't know her

. Okay.

. Okay? As an officer of the court, 1am
telling you I don't know her name. And you are
under oath and obliged to answer material and
relevant questions, and I want to know what her name
is.

MR. SCOTT: I will provide you the name
off the record, but I'm not -- if he feels it's

226

Please instruct the witness.
MR. SCOTT: Avoid that. We discussed that
yesterday.
THE WITNESS: That's fine.
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. What was the date of the phone
conversation that you tape recorded?

A. I don't recall. But it's on the
transcript.

Q. And does it also reflect that the
recording is being made with her permission?

A. Uh-huh.

Q. That's a yes?

A. Yes. Yes, that's a yes.

Q. What is Rebecca's last name?

A. You know Rebecca's last name and she has
asked me not to reveal it to the press. And so }
would like to comply with that -- with that request.
For purposes of discovery, you know her name, you
know her husband's name, you know her phone number,
and she has been called. But there's no reason for
me to reveal it so that it appears in the press that
she would be called by newspapers and by the media.

Q. Mr. Dershowitz, how do you know what I
know if you haven't told me?

inappropriate because of what -- he's not going

to answer the question. I will provide you the

name.
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Okay. She has still insisted that her
name not be revealed; is that correct?

A. Her husband asked me to do whatever |
could not to put her name in front of the press, in
front of the media.

Q. There's no -- there's no one from the
press here today.

MR. SCOTT: Yeah, but they're going to
order the transcript and they're going to sce,
so that's the same thing. And I've already
told --

A. You will have her name in five --

MR. SCOTT: I will give you her name --
A, -- minutes. All you have to do is --

MR. SCOTT: And, Jack, if you want to take
a break now --

THE REPORTER: Holdon. Hold on,
gentlemen. You can't talk at the same time.

MR. SCOTT: Let me do the talking at this
point.

THE WITNESS: Please.
