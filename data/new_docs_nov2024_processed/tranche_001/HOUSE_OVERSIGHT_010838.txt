o22017 1 Jeffrey Epstein where -- where this seemed to be going
22019 2 onand was very close to Epstein, staying at the mansion
022022 3 frequently.

022023 4 And so she would, obviously, be -- I guess if
022023 § you have Epstein at the -- the top of the -- you know,
o22027 § the kingpin of the operation, Maxwell would be, you
022030 7 know, a close second or certainly at, you know, the
022032 § higher echelon.

22033 9 So, obviously, someone who would have, you
22035 10 know, very significant information about, you know, the
022033 14 sex trafficking, who were the other people that the --
022041 12 the girls were being trafficked to, what kind of abuse
02:20:43 13 was going on, you know, what kinds of sex toys were
022046 14 being used to abuse them, because I think it was in her
022048 15 room or -- or adjacent to her room that many of these --
o22082 16 these devices were located, and so she would have had
022055 17 very significant information to provide.

02.2057 18 And so in connection with the civil cases

022100 19 that some of the girls had filed against Mr. Epstein,
022102 20 her deposition was set, in fact, by my co-counsel,

o22105 21 Mr. Edwards, and then there was some haggling over a
o22i10 22 confidentiality agreement, you know, what are we

o2212 23 gonna -- and that had all been worked out, and then she
o22i14 24 was set for a deposition and finally agreed, you know,
o22116 25 to a deposition.

zai 1 And just shortly, you know, I think a couple
eza1e 2 of days before that deposition, she canceled. And well,
022123 3 she didn't cancel. Her -- her attorney called to cancel
022123 4 the deposition and represented that Miss Maxwell was
o2z2120 5 outside the United States of America and had no plans to
o22133 § return back to the United States.

o22i35 | 7 And $0, at that point, the deposition was --
o22140 8 was not able to go forward. But it turned out that she
o22143 9 had not left the United States for an extended period of
o22146 10 time. She was spotted later at a wedding of a prominent
o22140 11 person in New York.

ozaiso 12 And so that was Maxwell fitting into this

02:21:52 13 pattern of, you know, Epstein was being told -- you

02:21:56 14 know, the Palm Beach Police Department being told by
022157 15 Dershowitz that Epstein will answer your questions, and
o22200 16 then, you know, not -- not getting information, Maxwell
022203 17 evading the deposition.

022206 18 Jean Luc Brunel was another person who seemed
o22200 19 to be very much involved in -- in trafficking the girls,
o2z2210 20 and it was the same situation. A deposition was set to
022213 21 ‘try to get answers, you know, who is involved, which
022216 22 girls are involved, what are their names, what's -~

022217 23 what's going on?

o2:22:18 24 And so Brunel's deposition is set and then
022223 25 he -~ he finagles out of it too. I don't recall exactly

what his excuse was, but, you know, evaded the
deposition and, in fact, later information came to light
he was hiding out in, you know, in the mansion of
Epstein while he's claiming he's unavailable for -- for
deposition.

So -- so this pattern of Mr. Dershowitz, you
know, where there were three attempts to obtain
information from him, if that's all I had, I guess that

would have been one thing. But what I had was a pattern

of people who were implicated in this sex trafficking

ring evading questions, you know, quite in violation of

court orders and depositions and things -- I shouldn't

say court order -- in violation of the deposition

notices that were being sent and agreements being made,

you know, through counsel.
And then in addition to that, I had this, so

why -- why would you think that, you know, there's this

sex trafficking, you know, ring going on? It sounds
kind of farfetched.
Well -- well, one of the things that I had

available to me on December 30th was a photograph that

was widely available on the Internet, and that

photograph depicted three people.

It depicted Glenn Maxwell, Prince Andrew, and
Virginia Roberts, and the -- at the time that it looked

like Virginia Roberts was an underage girl. She was not
dressed in formal attire. And Prince Andrew had his arm
around her, I think if memory serves, and right next --
smiling in the background is Miss Maxwell, and it
appeared that that was a private residence, presumably
in London, close to Buckingham Palace where ~~ where
Prince Andrew lived.

And so here was Prince Andrew with this
underage girl with Glenn Maxwell, the -- the right-hand
girl, if that's the right expression -- I probably
should say -- strike that -- right-hand woman of --
of -- of Mr. Epstein -- that were there and somebody had
taken the photograph.

Given the surrounding circumstances, I
thought perhaps Mr. Epstein had taken the photograph.
So that would have shown Virginia Roberts's sexual abuse
was not confined just to Florida, not confined to the
New York mansion; it would have -- it would have
presumably continued into London where one of, you know,
the highest, most powerful persons in the governmental
structure that -- that exists in England was now
involved in -- in sexual abuse.

And so that created grave concern about, how
far did this sex trafficking ring reach; what were their
connections; what were their abilities to influence, you
