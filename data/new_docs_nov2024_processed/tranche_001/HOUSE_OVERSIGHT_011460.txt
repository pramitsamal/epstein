clients that are saying that exact same thing right now, your
Honor.

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, could we do the 13th, the
Thursday of that week?

THE COURT: Yes. I don't see any reason not to.
Okay.

MS. McCAWLEY: That's all I had, your Honor. Thank
you. And thank you for your patience, everyone, today.

THE COURT: Have we completed the briefing and

everything everybody wants to submit

on the black book issue?

MS. McCAWLEY: Well, yes, your Honor. So now, as of
last night, it was fully briefed. So there are three briefs on
it, essentially. We had a motion in limine to allow it in,

they had a motion in limine to exclude it,

and it came up

previously -- I forget, we argued it a couple weeks ago in the
context of another motion -- oh, I'm sorry, because, your
Honor, you requested that with respect to Diane Flores. So we
didn't reargue it today, it is fully briefed for you.

THE COURT: Okay. In other words, I've got everything
on that.

MS. McCAWLEY: You do, your Honor, yes.

THE COURT: Okay. Anything else?

MS. McCAWLEY: Not that I'm aware of.

MR. PAGLIUCA: I think we're concluded today, your
Honor. Thank you.
