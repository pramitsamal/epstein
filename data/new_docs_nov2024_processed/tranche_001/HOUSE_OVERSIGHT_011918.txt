32, Plaintiff Brunel continues to own and operate Plaintiff MC2 to this day, their names
never having been cleared from the massive and totally negative media coverage involving
Epstein and his illegal activities. Plaintiffs have been, and continue to be, irreparably harmed by
these false internet-based links to Epstein. (Exhibits R & S attached).

33. Second, Plaintiff Brunel was also told by Epstein to leave the Palm Beach area in
anticipation of a deposition of Plaintiff Brunel in a criminal case against Epstein. On the direct
advice of Epstein, Plaintiff Brunel went to Europe and Asia for a period of time. This was done
for the sole purpose of delaying Plaintiff Brunel’s deposition.

34. Asa direct result of Plaintiff Brunel’s travels, his deposition was delayed twice. When it
was finally scheduled for November 2009, Plaintiff Brunel was in fact available (Exhibit L
attached). However, a medical emergency in the family of his attorney further delayed this
deposition (Exhibit M attached). It was never rescheduled and he was never deposed.

35. This was a blatant example of obstruction of justice in the criminal case. Epstein was
solely responsible for telling Plaintiff Brunel to leave the area. Plaintiff Brunel lost a huge
opportunity to clear his name, and that of his agency, Plaintiff MC2.

36. Third, as a result of all of the facts stated above, Plaintiff Brunel was under tremendous
psychological pressure throughout this period of time.

37. This psychological pressure resulted in Plaintiff Brunel avoiding business contacts as set
forth above. This pressure also directly caused Plaintiff Brunel to avoid certain social contacts
during this period of time.

38. Plaintiff Brune] became extremely withdrawn and anxious at this time.

39. — Epstein’s conduct was the direct cause of Plaintiff Brunel’s psychological state. The
press was reporting extensively on the lurid details of Epstein’s illegal activities with the under-

aged girls.
