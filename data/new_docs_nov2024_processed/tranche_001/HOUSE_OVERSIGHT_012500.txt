questions. Thank you.

MR. LEOPOLD: Before we go off the record,
it's my understanding -- Mr. Goldberger can
correct the record, but we have stipulated that
color copies of the documents that were identified
for identification certainly will be attached to
the deposition and counsel! will be taking the
photographs across street so that they can be
laser color copied so that we have a copy, and I'm
assuming he'!l1 get a copy to the court reporter,
too, to attach, actually a certified copy to the

deposition.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Done.

MR. LEOPOLD: That's if you agree to that.
If not, then | want to pull each one out and put
exhibit labels on them, which we should do before
we leave.

MR. GOLDBERGER: We're not going to do
either. I'll have copies sent to the court
reporter and she can attach them to the
deposition.

MR. LEOPOLD: So you're not going to agree
to what we talked about during the break then.

MR. GOLDBERGER: I'm not quite sure what
your asking me to do. Let me finish.

MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. Sure. That's fine.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. If you want me to
go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office and make copies
and then I'll give those to the court reporter,
