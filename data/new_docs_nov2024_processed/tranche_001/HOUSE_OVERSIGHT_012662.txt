pursuant to the Justice for All Act of 2004 and other federal legislation, including:

(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.

(2) The sight to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding
involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused.

(3) The right not to be excluded from any public court proceeding, unless the court
determines that your testimony may be materially altered if you are present for other
portions of a proceeding.

(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court
involving release, plea, or sentencing.

(5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the United States in the case.
