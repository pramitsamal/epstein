1.4 The Secret Sauce 3

1.3 CogPrime

The AGI design presented here has not previously been granted a name independently of its
particular software implementations, but for the purposes of this book it needs one, so we’ve
christened it CogPrime . This fits with the name “OpenCogPrime” that has already been
used to describe the software implementation of CogPrime within the open-source OpenCog
AGI software framework. The OpenCogPrime software, right now, implements only a small
fraction of the CogPrime design as described here. However, OpenCog was designed specifically
to enable efficient, scalable implementation of the full CogPrime design (as well as to serve as a
more general framework for AGI R&D); and work currently proceeds in this direction, though
there is a lot of work still to be done and many challenges remain. 1

The CogPrime design is more comprehensive and thorough than anything that has been
presented in the literature previously, including the work of others reviewed in Chapter 4. It
covers all the key aspects of human intelligence, and explains how they interoperate and how
they can be implemented in digital computer software. Part 1 of this work outlines CogPrime at
a high level, and makes a number of more general points about artificial general intelligence and
the path thereto; then Part 2 digs deeply into the technical particulars of CogPrime. Even Part
2, however, doesn’t explain all the details of CogPrime that have been worked out so far, and
it definitely doesn’t explain all the implementation details that have gone into designing and
building OpenCogPrime. Creating a thinking machine is a large task, and even the intermediate
level of detail takes up a lot of pages.

1.4 The Secret Sauce

There is no consensus on why all the related technological and scientific progress mentioned
above has not yet yielded AI software systems with human-like general intelligence (or even
greater levels of brilliance!). However, we hypothesize that the core reason boils down to the
following three points:

e Intelligence depends on the emergence of certain high-level structures and dynamics across
a system’s whole knowledge base;

e We have not discovered any one algorithm or approach capable of yielding the emergence
of these structures;

e Achieving the emergence of these structures within a system formed by integrating a number
of different ATI algorithms and structures requires careful attention to the manner in which

| This brings up a terminological note: At several places in this Volume and the next we will refer to the current
CogPrime or OpenCog implementation; in all cases this refers to OpenCog as of late 2013. We realize the risk
of mentioning the state of our software system at time of writing: for future readers this may give the wrong
impression, because if our project goes well, more and more of CogPrime will get implemented and tested as
time goes on (e.g. within the OpenCog framework, under active development at time of writing). However, not
mentioning the current implementation at all seems an even worse course to us, since we feel readers will be
interested to know which of our ideas — at time of writing — have been honed via practice and which have not.
Online resources such as http: //opencog.org may be consulted by readers curious about the current state
of the main OpenCog implementation; though in future forks of the code may be created, or other systems may
be built using some or all of the ideas in this book, ete.
