102 5 A Generic Architecture of Human-Like Cognition

touch and smell (the latter being better modeled as something like an asymmetric Hopfield net,
prone to frequent chaotic dynamics [LLW~05]) — these may also cross-connect with each other
and with the more hierarchical perceptual subnetworks. Of course the suggested architecture
could inclide any number of sensory modalities; the diagram is restricted to four just for
simplicity.

The self-organized patterns in the upper layers of perceptual hierarchies may become quite
complex and may develop advanced cognitive capabilities like episodic memory, reasoning, lan-
guage learning, etc. A pure deep learning approach to intelligence argues that all the aspects
of intelligence emerge from this kind of dynamics (among perceptual, action and reinforcement
hierarchies). Our own view is that the heterogeneity of human brain architecture argues against
this perspective, and that deep learning systems are probably better as models of perception
and action than of general cognition. However, the integrative diagram is not committed to
our perspective on this — a deep-learning theorist could accept the integrative diagram, but
argue that all the other portions besides the perceptual, action and reinforcement hierarchies
should be viewed as descriptions of phenomena that emerge in these hierarchies due to their
interaction.

Figure 5.6 shows an action subsystem and a reinforcement subsystem, parallel to the per-
ception subsystem. Two action hierarchies, one for an arm and one for a leg, are shown for
