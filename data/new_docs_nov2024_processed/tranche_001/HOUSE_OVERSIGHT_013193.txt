14.4 Implications of Patternist Philosophy for Derived Hypergraphs of Intelligent Systems 277

CogPrime’s cognitive algorithms based on the explicitly existent Nodes and Links related to
the Frag Node.

This halo of Atoms related to the Frag node is called the Irag map. In general, some maps
will center around a particular Atom, like this rag map, others may not have any particular
identifiable center. CogPrime’s cognitive processes act directly on the level of Nodes and Links,
but they must be analyzed in terms of their impact on maps as well. In SMEPH terms, Cog-
Prime maps may be said to correspond to SMEPH ConceptNodes, and for instance bundles of
Links between the Nodes belonging to a map may correspond to a SMEPH Link between two
ConceptNodes.
