politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances” —
categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into. The flight logs showed Clinton
traveling on Epstein’s plane on numerous occasions between 2002 and 2005. See Flight logs
attached hereto as Exhibit “MM.” Clinton traveled on many of those flights with Ghislaine
Maxwell, Sarah Kellen, and Adriana Mucinska, - all employees and/or co-conspirators of
Epstein’s that were closely connected to Epstein’s child exploitation and sexual abuse. The
documents clearly show that Clinton frequently flew with Epstein aboard his plane, then
suddenly stopped - raising the suspicion that the friendship abruptly ended, perhaps because of
events related to Epstein’s sexual abuse of children. Epstein’s personal phone directory from his
computer contains e-mail addresses for Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him, including
those for his assistant (Doug Band), his schedulers, and what appear to be Clinton’s personal
numbers. This information certainly leads one to believe that Clinton might well be a source of
relevant information and efforts to obtain discovery from him were reasonably calculated to lead
to admissible evidence. See Exhibits “B”, “F” “AA”, “DD”, and “MM” and Edwards Affidavit,
Exhibit “N” at Q15.

: 71. Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., provided notice that he intended to take the deposition
of Donald Trump. Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so: (a) The message pads
eaifisnated from Epstein’s home indicated that Trump called Epstein’s West Palm Beach
mansion on several occasions during the time period most relevant to my Edwards’s clients’
complaints; (b) Trump was quoted in a Vanity Fair article about Epstein as saying I've known
Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy, He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes

beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it --
