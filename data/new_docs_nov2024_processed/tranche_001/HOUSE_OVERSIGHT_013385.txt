A second reason exists for making discovery of Epstein’s acts of abuse of other minor
girls admissible. Juries considering punitive damages issues are plainly entitled to consider “the
existence and frequency of similar past conduct.” TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources
Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 462 0.28 (1993). This is because the Supreme Court recognizes “that a
recidivist may be punished more severely than a first offender . . . [because] repeated misconduct
is more reprehensible than an individual instance of malfeasance.” BMW of North America, Inc.
Vv. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 577 (1996) (supporting citations omitted). In addition, juries can consider
other similar acts evidence as part of the deterrence calculation in awarding punitive damages,
because “evidence that a defendant has repeatedly engaged in prohibited conduct while knowing
. that it was unlawful would provide relevant support for an argument that strong medicine is
reaitined to cure the defendant’s disrespect for the law.” Jd. at 576-77. In the cases Edwards
filed against Epstein, his clients were entitled to attempt to prove that Epstein “repeatedly
engaged in prohibited conduct” — i.e., because he was a predatory pedophile, he sexually
assaulted deems and dozens of minor girls. The discovery of Epstein’s friends who might have
had direct or circumstantial evidence of other acts of sexual assault was accordingly entirely
proper. Edwards is therefore entitled summary judgment to the extent his claim is based on
efforts by Edwards to obtain discovery of Epstein’s friends.

m1. EPSTEIN’S LAWSUIT MUST BE DISMISSED BECAUSE OF HIS REFUSAL TO
: PARTICIPATE IN REASONABLE DISCOVERY.

As is readily apparent from the facts of this case, Epstein has filed a lawsuit but then
refused to allow any real discovery about the merits of his case. Instead, when asked hard

questions about whether he has any legitimate claim at all, Epstein has hidden behind the Fifth
