ATTORNEY FOR EPSTEIN VICTIMS: 'T HAVE NEVER SEEN A STRANGER CASE' Palm Beach Daily News
September 20, 2009 Sunday

‘Out of the ordinary'
West Palm Beach criminal defense attorney Gregg Lerman said several aspects of the Epstein case are unusual.

I don't understand why it would be a federal case in this circumstance, and why was there anything in writing at all
and why did they seal the agreement? Lerman said. Why did it go to the grand jury instead of through the state filing
lewd assault charges? That's unusual. And it's very unusual that they structure a plea to get county time rather than
prison time. That's definitely out of the ordinary. Nobody goes to county jail as a state criminal punishment.
