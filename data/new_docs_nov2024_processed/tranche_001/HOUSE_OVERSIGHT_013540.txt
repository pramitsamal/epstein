while calmly and quickly surveying the routes of several potential receivers. The
pattern found in his handwriting features, however, resembled those Johnnie
Unitas, the Hall of Fame quarterback of the Baltimore (then) Colts who, in spite of
his small size, famously played with great courage and physical toughness. In
chronic and severe back pain, he played regularly until retirement in his early 40’s.
Fouts drafted in the third round with a small five-figure bonus, proved to be a great
bargain for the Charger franchise.

Given the theoretically infinite number of ways that a personality can be, it is
remarkable that the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American
Psychiatric Association, DMS-IV, describes only eight types, which form three
subsets of exaggerated expressions of stable personality styles called personality
disorders. All eight personality disorders can be grouped into: (1) Cluster A - Odd
and eccentric types, whose anxiety is related to the felt threat of disintegration and
annihilation of the self and whose style is dominated by mistrustful paranoia, a
schizoid, detached and emotionally flat pattern or the isolated strange eccentricism
of schizotypal characters, (2) Cluster B - Unstable and impulsive types whose
anxiety is related to loss of the stable self and whose style is dominated by
irresponsible antisocial behavior, chronic instability with high amplitude fluctuations
in behavior called borderline, or patterns of excessive emotionality and dramatic
display associated with histrionic characters; and (3) Cluster C - Fearful types
whose anxiety is related to hypersensitivity to criticism, guilt and feelings of
inadequacy or loss of control, and whose style is dominated by interpersonal
avoidance, clinging dependency, or rigid lock up into obsessive-compulsive efforts
to do the right thing and avoid disapproval. This remarkably small array of
stylistically consistent global behaviors selected from a practically infinite number of
imaginable possibilities establishes a small set of invariants of some, perhaps
abstract, property. These characteristic patterns inspire our search for the implied

brain and behavioral conservation laws that may underlie them.
