and the secret to vigor and longevity. “...to achieve fullness of life one had to abide
in empty nothingness, xuwu.” In Lao-Tsu’s Tao-Te-Ching, “...the Way is gained by
daily loss, loss upon loss until...by letting go, it all gets done...”

William James, in The Principles of Psychology, tried to capture the subjective
dynamics of the brain as an on-going preconscious stream of statistical wave
processes. He envisioned autonomously increasing and decreasing coherence
emerging spontaneously and from sensorial evoked thoughts via the confluence

tt

and disaggregation of statistical wave processes, “...wave crests and hollows...”
that achieved temporary statistical stability by “...feelings of relation, consubstantial
with our feelings or thoughts of the terms between which they (only temporarily)
obtain.” In the more receptive, higher entropy brain systems, fleeting forms change
without continuity, Jumping from one to another with “magical rapidity,” but being not
already engaged, are available for use for self-organized structure evoked by new
information. Without ordered, low entropy, preconceived ideational defects in the
resting random brain field, the full attentional statistical machine is available to
sensitively respond in self-organized, quasi-stable states of cognitive, conative and
affective integration. They then disappear; this brain relaxes quickly, ready for new
experience. This contrasts with those brains that are dominated by islands of order
composed of personality fixations and rigid belief systems, low entropy defects,

which interfere with sensorially responsive sel/f-organization.
