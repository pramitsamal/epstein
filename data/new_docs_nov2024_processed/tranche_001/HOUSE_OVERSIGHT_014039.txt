60 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104

ability to participate meaningfully in the criminal process when federal
prosecutors narrowly interpreted their responsibilities under the Act.
Second, the Article reviews the purpose, text, structure, and history of the
CVRA, concluding that they all support the conclusion that crime victims
have rights during criminal investigations. Third, our Article critiques the
Department’s memorandum, demonstrating that the Department’s analysis
is unpersuasive. Fourth and finally, the Article provides a_ specific
approach for determining when rights should attach—specifically when
federal law enforcement agencies have identified a crime with sufficient
precision to send a “target” letter to a criminal defendant. We also
observe that federal and state prosecutors have already accorded rights to
victims before formally filing charges, which further undermines the
Department’s overly narrow construction of the Act.
