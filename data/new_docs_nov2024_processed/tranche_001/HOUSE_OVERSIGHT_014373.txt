= CCAR a product of regulatory attitude: The panelists agreed that CCAR in its
current form is not a result of legislation as post-recession bank stress tests (SCAP)
existed prior to Dodd-Frank. Furthermore, the panelists noted Dodd-Frank’s
definition of a stress test is very basic, which has been made more stringent and
complex as a result of regulators. Mr Cohen also noted that a lack of transparency
of the test was the least defensible part of CCAR.

= Biggest obstacle for bank M&A and activist influence is regulation. Despite
headlines of increased shareholder activism within the banking industry, the
majority of investors polled (61%) believe activist investors have only a moderate
impact on corporate strategy (see chart). Specifically, Mr. Cohen explained that two
of the three reasons why an activist will typically get involved with a corporate are
difficult to achieve on a bank’s board given the level of regulatory oversight on the
industry. While selling the bank is the one area where activists have had success,
this typically occurs at the community bank level. That said, he believes a change in
attitude of regulators could free up M&A activity.
