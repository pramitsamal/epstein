Japan Investment Strategy

Nikkei to 20,000: Inventory cycle upturn — cyclicals;
inflation — banks, insurance

Investment Strategy

18 November 2016

Key takeaways

° Solid macro and weaker JPY positive for Japan equities, which also tend to outperform when
US rate rises (esp. steepening)

° The inventory cycle continues to recover on fiscal easing and capex, implying cyclical stocks
will outperform

° Inflation and higher yields positive for banks, insurance. Risk is diplomacy, protectionism, and
US economic cycle

FULL REPORT

Bullish equities 2017; rotation into cyclicals, banks, insurance

We are bullish Japan equities for 2017 and we estimate the Nikkei 225 index will recover to 20,000 by end-
2017 (see $/¥'s eventual surge: Buy Nikkei 06 September 2016). Our new Chief Japan Economist Izumi
Devalier forecasts above-consensus Japan GDP growth and inflation in 2017, which is also supportive of our
bullish equities scenario (see Ready for ignition 18 November 2016). We expect rotation into cyclicals, banks
and insurance as explained below.
