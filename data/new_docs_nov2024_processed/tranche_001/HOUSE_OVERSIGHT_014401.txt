Key takeaways

° We are upbeat on Japan's outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength of
medium-term GDP and inflation.

° While the consensus looks for just 0.8% growth next year, we expect growth of 1.4% in
CY17 and 1.2% in CY 18.

° With inflation moving in the right direction, we expect BoJ to keep its rates targets
unchanged for the foreseeable future.
