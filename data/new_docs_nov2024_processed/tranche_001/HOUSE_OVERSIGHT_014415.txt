2. Capex revival
We also see a fundamental case for higher capital spending. Borrowing rates are very
low and will fall further in real terms as inflation rises. Stronger growth and improved
confidence should also encourage higher capex. And deepening supply-side constraints
offer a strong incentive for Japan Inc. to accelerate productivity-enhancing capex,
ensuring that this expansion is durable.
For these reasons, we think that the impulse of capital expenditures will likely be higher
in the non-manufacturing sector, where capacity utilization rates are higher, and labor
shortages (and hence wage pressures) are more acute (Chart 15 and Chart 16).

Chart 17 shows the ratio of personnel costs to sales, using MoF corporate survey data.
The ratio is particularly high for lodging & accommodations (23%), eating & drinking
services (27%), medical, healthcare & welfare (37%) and education & learning support
(37%). Somewhat surprisingly, personnel expenses are fairly restrained in retail. But this
is partly due to the relatively heavy reliance on lower-cost part-time workers. Given the
rapid growth in part-timers’ wages, such cost savings is likely to become increasingly
difficult to maintain.
