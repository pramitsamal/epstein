3 risks — reality vs hope, higher yields, politics

The biggest risk to our view is that actual US fiscal easing turns out to be minimal. But
we believe the USD/JPY’s move will be quicker than whatever reality emerges in coming
months. China’s unexpected RMB devaluation or any explicit rhetoric to guide USD
weakness by the new US administration could eventually trigger significant JPY strength.
The other risk is a rapid increase in US long-term yields triggers risk-off trade,
supporting Japanese yen. However, we believe a potential correction in US equity is
unlikely to reverse the medium-term direction of USD/JPY (though it could cause a
short-term pullback as our technical analysis suggests) because higher yields and
USD/JPY are backed by fundamentals for now —prospect for fiscal easing. Finally, politics
is a significant concern. The President-elect has previously criticized the Japan-US
security alliance. A shift away from the Japan-US security alliance could lead to higher
geopolitical risk for Japan. It could also lead to more defense spending and expansion of
Japanese military capability and could lift prospect for fiscal expansion. A combination
of higher geopolitical risk and defense spending is probably less bearish USD/JPY than
Japanese equities.
