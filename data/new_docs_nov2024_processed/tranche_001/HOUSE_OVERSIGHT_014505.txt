Pediatric Dentist

Or. Flavia Tingling

Or. Tingling was born on
the beawti-ful sunny island
of Jamaica, bet shortly
thereafter relocated to the
cold winters of Michigan!
The move was prompted by
her father's educational pursuit to become an Orthodontist
at The University of Michigan- Ann Ar-bor. Her mother
became a dental hy-gienist when Dr. Tingling was in high
school, After her completion of an undergraduate degree
from the “Big House, Dr. Tingling surprised every-one and
followed the path of her DNA, by becoming a dentist!

She then traded the cold winters of Ann Arbor for the
bright lights of New York City! She was a fellow of General
Dentistry at the Columbia University School of Dental
and Oral Surgery, for 2 years. It was her exposure there
thal led her to pursue a specialty degree in Pediatrics.
She completed her Pediatric Dentistry Resi-dency at
St. Barnabas Hospital- New York Presbyterian Weil Cor-nell,
Bronx, New York. Her ganuine.bove of children is evidenced
by the arduous tasks she completed, to enable her to
treal them ex-clusively. She fikes practicing dentistry, but
LOVES rendering care to children?
