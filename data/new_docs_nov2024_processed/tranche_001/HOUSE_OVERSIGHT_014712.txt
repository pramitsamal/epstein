Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

e Stretch: when the engineers realize what is going on they launch a task to shut down the RL task,
but the RL scheduler doesn't assign this task to any machine. The only way to recover the compute
power of the company is to manually shut down each server, some of which are in remote
locations.

DISCUSSION

How might the possibility of such inadvertent scenarios with the use of resources be addressed ina
proactive manner, as part of design and implementation of Al systems? What methods, including
high-level monitoring and control, might employed? How might such approaches apply to related
concerns with long-term futures of Al?
