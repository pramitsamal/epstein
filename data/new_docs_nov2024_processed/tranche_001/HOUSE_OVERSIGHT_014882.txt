Price objective basis & risk

Hess Corp. (HES)

Our price objective of $80 / share is based on a 5-year outlook which assumes a 5.5x
DACF multiple and a commodity deck of $67.50 WTI and $70 Brent to which we add
$10/ sh for Liza in offshore Guyana. The multiple is based on a finite timeline to
delivery which is supported by core NAV.

The risks to our price objective are: 1) the oil and gas price environment, (2) slowdowns
in development drilling that leave production below expectations, and (3) news flow
around HES' exploratory and appraisal drilling activities that could impact the stock.
