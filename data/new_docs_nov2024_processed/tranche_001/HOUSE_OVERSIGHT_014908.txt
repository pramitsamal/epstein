Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q

Underlying MAU and DAU trends are still the key metrics for the stock, in our view. We
assume MAUs grow 16% y/y to 1.91bn and DAUs 16% to 1.26bn, keeping DAU/MAU at
a steady 66%. It’s possible (but hard to predict) that management offers an update on
Instagram users (600mn MAU, 400mn DAU in 4Q}, and more specifically, Instagram
Stories (150mn DAU in January). On the messaging front, there could be a Messenger
user update (1bn as of 7/16), while a WhatsApp update is less likely (1.2bn as of 4Q16).
We expect ad impressions to grow 46% y/y (49% in 4Q) and ad prices to increase 2%
y/y (3% in 4Q).

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:

¢ Expense trajectory or lack of an expense guidance change could disappoint:
While we continue to anticipate favorable revisions to management’s 2017 expense
forecast in 2H, near-term adjustments may be less likely given the velocity of new
product launches and potential video content investments.

* 1Q ad revenue deceleration possible: We note that 4Q was particularly strong
and it’s possible 1Q normalization could result in revenue growth deceleration.

¢ Lack of commentary on monetization strategy: While Messenger/WhatsApp
monetization is likely still a 2018 story, lack of constructive commentary on timing
could disappoint.

- User deceleration always a risk: MAU and DAU growth has surprised to the upside
at mid-to-high teens y/y growth, and any meaningful slowdown could raise
competitive concerns.

Top 1Q data point: Instagram reaches 1mn advertisers

Mid-quarter data points were somewhat limited in 1Q, though management did give an
update on the Instagram monetization efforts. In a March 2017 update, management
indicated that Instagram grew to 1mn advertisers, double the number since 9/16, with
business profile pages up to 8mn from 5mn in 4Q. Facebook’s comparable metrics are
4mn advertisers (as of 9/16) and 65mn business pages (4Q16).

For early advertiser checks, general feedback suggested positive trends, but more
‘steady as it goes’ than absolute blow out. The stronger 4Q was highlighted as a tough
