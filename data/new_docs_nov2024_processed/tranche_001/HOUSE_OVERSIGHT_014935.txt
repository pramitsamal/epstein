Zillow has effectively captured the online U.S. real estate market, allowing them to
accelerate monetization and access to a large TAM with $87bn in total real estate
commissions paid in 2016 and Zillow powering just 5% of the commissions through its
Premier Agent platform. Although there is potential for the mortgage business to
create a headwind if the CFPB issued a negative ruling against Zillow, we still like the
stock into the quarter, as we prefer business with minimal competition, and believe that
the high ROI of the real estate premium platform to real estate agents will ensure
agents buy placements on Zillow regardless of mortgage broker involvement. We
maintain our $42 PO based on a 6x our 2018E EV/Sales and supported by our DCF
valuation. Our multiple is roughly in-line for online real estate lead generation sites in
other countries operating in developed countries.
