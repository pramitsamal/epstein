Sheriff Chapman,
Loudoun Count, VA

Did you ever consider that Loudoun was a target? That your community was induced to walk it’s own
children down the plank as compensation for what Loudoun had done to the young Dima Yakovlev?
Because now child exploitation is deeply embedded within your community with your own people
(your own police, your own prosecutors, your own public defenders and private attorneys) protecting
this very system that will be used to take the futures of your Loudoun children (see more of the details
below). Is it possible that that's how this happened, and you saw it not unfolding before your eyes? Or
was it simply money and just another good enough justification?

Russian born 21 month-old Dima Yakovlev (renamed Chase Harrison by his Purcellville, VA adoptive

Bud Horton (characterized by Loudoun County as a victim of the recent False statement to Law
Enforcement Officer (LEO) of him sexually exploiting the 15 year-old Anjulee Gunther), Henry Bud
Horton named Bob Rachel as one of the DEA guys he used to work with. This takes on unusual
significance in light of the below, no?

(How lovely, by the way, this following information and the ways in which it helps us understand many
of the hidden influences: Halliburton is also involved with the Russian mob. They're got sort of two

things going on. One is oil and the other is drug trafficking. Halliburton is a story all by itself. (says

Mr. Satz,

I'm forwarding the below information as it pertains to Mrs. Lesley Simms and more importantly the

As you may know, she was once close with an individual named Matthew Horton with whom she
attended George Mason University, and through Matthew, Ms. Simms became well-acquainted with
