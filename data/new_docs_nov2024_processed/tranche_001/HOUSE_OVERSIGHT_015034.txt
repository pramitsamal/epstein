“He has lived on the edge so long, he gets his mailed delivered there.”
--San Francisco Chronicle

“Krassner lives in a world where Truth and Satire are swingers,
changing partners so often you never know who belongs with whom.”

--Playboy

“Perhaps the satire magazine that most closely resembles Charlie
Hebdo in terms of inflammatory imagery was The Realist, created by Paul
Krassner...”

--Time

“Paul taught me that extreme stylistic accuracy could make even the
most bizarre comedic concept credible. He is a unique character on the
American landscape. A self-described “investigative satirist,’ he straddles the
lines between politics, culture, pornography and drugs -- in other words, the
land where all of us, were we really honest with ourselves, would choose to
dwell.”

--Harry Shearer

“T have been a fan of his since I was a snot-nosed kid, and his words
have been a driving force and influence on my life. If you have read his work
before, you know the joys that you are in for. If you haven’t, start reading,
and consider this your lucky day. For Paul Krassner is an activist, a
philosopher, a lunatic and a saint, but most of all he is funny.”

--Lewis Black
