I' m_ seventy-five. Hell, | drink at least eight glasses of water a day
now—just like I’ m supposed to, for my health—but then | have to pee at
least eight times a day. Ironically, the TV commercials warn that if you have
to pee eight times in 24 hours, it’ s a symptom of an overactive bladder.

Indeed, irony has permeated this long-running scandal, beginning
to end. It was ironic that my sexual appetite helped put me in office—the
Gennifer Flowers allegation originally placed me in the media
spotlight—and it was my sexual appetite that almost tossed me out of that
same office. And it’ s ironic that, although Kathleen Willey enjoyed our
brief encounter, to prove it we would have had to resort to obtaining
testimony from her confidant, the wonderful Linda Tripp.

Now, there are things that I’ ve done as president of which I’ m
truly ashamed. Even before my inauguration, | made it a point to stop in
Arkansas to oversee the execution of a mentally retarded prisoner. At his
last meal, he said he’ d wait to have his dessert, a slice of pecan pie, until
after the execution—that’ s how much he understood what was going on.
I' m ashamed of under-protecting the rights of gays and over-protecting
children from the Internet. I' m ashamed of being aga/nst medical
marijuana and for requiring a urine test as a prerequisite to obtaining a

driver’ s license. I' m ashamed of bombing Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan.
