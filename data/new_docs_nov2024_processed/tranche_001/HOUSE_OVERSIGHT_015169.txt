dropping bombs on Pakistan. Or an air strike on Iran. Even if Israel did
that, it would be with U.S. aid and approval. Also, there’ s a scenario
floating around that Joe Biden will drop out of the race in deference to
Hillary as Obama’ s vice-presidential running mate replacing Biden. That
would really ruin our chances of winning.

PALIN: So tell me what the second option is.

McCAIN: That you drop out of the race. It’ s the honorable thing to
do.

PALIN: What are you gonna do, kick me off the island? Let’ s face it,
John, if | dropped out, you’ d lose the election for sure, and you know it.
You need to show me off during this campaign. |’ m your biggest asset. |
wanted to go on my own Palin Talk Express tour, but no, your neocon
friends--they discovered me a year before you and | met--and now
they’ reso afraid | can’ t function without their guidance. They’ re like a
mad beehive, spouting campaign buzz words at me. But | will mever drop
out of this race. | would sooner give to the media my tape of our one-
night stand in my hotel room at the governors’ conference last February.

McCAIN: If you were to do that, | would release my tape of this
whole conversation. So we’ re just canceling each other out with such

tactics. But that’ s what | like about you. You’ re such a feisty lady.
