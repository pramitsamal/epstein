assured him that he had ‘nowhere to run, nowhere to hide from
Reagan’ s powers.’ “

So who /s this Aquino guy? According to Cathy, “In the early 1980s,
my base programming was instilled at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, by U.S.
Army Lt. Colonel Michael Aquino. He holds a Top Secret clearance in the
Defense Intelligence Agency’ s Psychological Warfare Division (PSYOP).
He is a professed neo-Nazi, the founder of the Himmler-inspired satanic
Temple of Set and has been charged with child ritual and sexual abuse at
the Presidio Day Care in San Francisco. But like my father, Aquino remains

‘above the law’ while he continues to traumatize and program CIA-

destined young minds in a quest to reportedly create the ‘superior race’
of Project Monarch mind-controlled slaves.”

| contacted Aquino, who retired in 1994, and he responded:

“Not only was | never stationed at Fort Campbell at anytime
throughout my entire Army career, but I’ ve never even visited that
particular post, on- or off-duty. | have never had any contact at anytime,
anyplace, anywhere with Cathy O’ Brien. | have never programmed sex
slaves for the government or anyone else. | have never participated in any
form of child abuse whatever.”

What does he think her motivation is?
