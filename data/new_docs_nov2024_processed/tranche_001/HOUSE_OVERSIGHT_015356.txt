Whether necrophilia is a victimless crime may still be open to
debate. Nevertheless, claiming that the act was consensual will not be
considered as a legal defense. It should be noted that the necrophilia
community ranges from those who are monogamous and stick with one
partner for a lifetime, to those who are promiscuous and hop from casket
to casket.

According to his own journal entry, Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of
the most revered figures in American literary history, was so devastated by
the death of his young wife, Ellen, that, shortly after her burial, he went out
to the cemetery one night and dug up her corpse, though he didn’ t
mention exactly what he did with it.

One of the most popular episodes of the police TV show, Homicide,
Life On the Streets, was about the investigation of an old lonely widower, a
mortician, who used to party with the corpses, setting them around a table
as if they were alive. They investigated him because he shot a neighbor
who knew about this practice, and then sat in the garden and waited for
the cops. But again, the mortician’ s relationship with those corpses may
have been purely platonic.

Let us now eavesdrop on the dialogue of a few participants in an

Internet support group, Necrophiliacs Anonymous:
