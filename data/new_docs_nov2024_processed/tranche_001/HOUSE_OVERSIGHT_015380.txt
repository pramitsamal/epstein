Carlin had long been vocal in support of the right to smoke and
ingest various drugs, and he posed this rhetorical question: “Why are
there no recreational drugs in suppository form?” | was pleased to
inform him that teenage girls have been experimenting with tampons
soaked in vodka, inserting them vaginally or rectally as a way of getting
intoxicated without their parents detecting booze on their breath.

No matter what else Richard Nixon accomplished in his lifetime, his
obituaries always mentioned him as the first American president to resign,
and no matter what else George Carlin accomplished in Aj/s lifetime, his
obits always connected him with the Supreme Court ruling on “The Seven
Words You Can’ t Say on Television.”

When asked in the Green Room at the Warner-Grand Theater by
producer Dan Pasley why he didn’ t include the word “nigger” in that
list, Carlin replied, “There’ s nothing funny about it -- that really /s a dirty
word -- but repressed words about sexual functions and bodily parts were
truly funny. | had only been thinking about the ‘dirty’ words in terms of
sex and bodily functions, and how uptight these religious freaks have
made us. 7hat’ sfun, that’ s some funny shit.”

At a private memorial for family and friends, Carlin's daughter Kelly

read from his burial instructions, written on May 1, 1990:
