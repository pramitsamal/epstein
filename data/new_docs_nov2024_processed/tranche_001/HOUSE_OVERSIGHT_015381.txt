Upon my death, | wish to be cremated. The disposition of my ashes
(dispersal at sea, on land or in the air) shall be determined by my surviving
family (wife and daughter) in accordance with their knowledge of my
prejudices and philosophies regarding geography and spirituality. Under
no circumstances are my ashes to be retained by anyone or buried in a
particular location. The eventual dispersal can be delayed for any
reasonable length of time required to reach a decision, but not to exceed
one month following my death.

| wish no public service of any kind. | wish no religious service of any kind.
| prefer a private gathering at my home, attended by friends and family
members who shall be determined by my surviving family (wife and
daughter). It should be extremely informal, they should play rhythm and
blues music, and they should laugh a lot. Vague references to spirituality
(secular) will be permitted.

Kelly added, “There will be no mention of God allowed” and “No one
will be allowed to say that ‘George is now smiling down at us from
Heaven above.’ “

Carlin once told an audience of children how to be a class clown as a
way of attracting attention. “I didn’ t start out with fake heart attacks in
the aisle,” he explained. Ah, if only that’ s what he was doing this time.

But a reporter did once ask him how he wanted to die.

“I’ d like to explode spontaneously in someone’ s living room,”

he replied. “That, to me, is the way to go out.”

And, through his CDs, DVDs, books, and online, George Carlin does
indeed continue to explode spontaneously in living rooms across the
country and around the world. Roasting With Robin
