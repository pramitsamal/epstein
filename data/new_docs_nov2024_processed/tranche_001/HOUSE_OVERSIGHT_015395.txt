‘How long you been knowin’ him?’ and | told him, ‘All through the

For the New Year, Flynt flew Gregory and me to the Bahamas.
Gregory was in the kitchen, diligently preparing a health drink for Flynt —
this must have been the birth of his Bahamian Diet powder -— and he was
also feeding unfiltered conspiracy theories to his eager student.

At midnight, we all went out on the dock and stood in a misty
drizzle as Gregory uttered truly eloquent prayers for each of us. When he
finished, Flynt’ s wife Althea whined, like Lucy in the Peanuts strip, “My
hair's getting all wet.” It was her way of saying “Amen.”

On New Year's Day, we were sitting in the sand, just relaxing. Flynt
had bought a paperback novel by Gore Vidal in the hotel store, but first he
was reading the Sunday New York Times and worrying about the
implications of juries with only six members. A moment later he was
rubbing suntan lotion on my back.

“I'll bet Hugh Hefner never did this for you,” he said.

visiting, so | had the unique pleasure of introducing them. Larry, Althea,
