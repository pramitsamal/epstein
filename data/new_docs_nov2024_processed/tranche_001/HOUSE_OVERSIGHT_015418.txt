how | fee/about this,’ but they’ re also saying, ‘My feelings should be
everyone’ s primary concern.’ Now the men are making this mistake,
they’ re saying, ‘Your feelings don’ t matter, your feelings are wrong
and your feelings are stupid.’ If you’ ve ever lived with a woman, you
can’ t step in shit worse than that, than to tell a woman that her feelings
don’ t matter. So, to the men! say, ‘Listen to what the women are saying
about this.’ To the women | say, “Now that we heard you, shut the fuck
up for a minute, and let’ s all get back together and kill the Jews.’
That’ s all | have to say about it.”

The audience laughed and applauded, as they did fifty years ago
when Lenny Bruce ended a riff on prejudice: “Randy, it won’ t matter any
more even if you are colored and I’ m Jewish, and even if Fritz is Japanese,
and Wong is Greek, because then we’ re all gonna stick together—and
beat up the Polacks.”

My notion of a rape-in of legislators’ wives in order to impregnate
them was no more meant to be taken literally than Louis C.K.’ s killing the
Jews or Lenny’ s beating up the Polacks. Rape-in was a misunderstood
metaphor; a pro-choice parable that unfortunately has become timely
again, but now my target has been clarified, though it's still those

increasingly incredible sexist legislators.
