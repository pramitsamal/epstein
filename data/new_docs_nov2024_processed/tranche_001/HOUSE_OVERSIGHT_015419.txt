Words and Phrases That I’ ve Coined

| really don’ t like to boast, but in my lifetime, on half a dozen
occasions, | have actually added words and phrases to the language. It’ s
something | always wanted to do. What a thrill it must have been for Dr.
Harold Cerumen, who decided that cleaning out earwax should be known
as “cerumen disimpaction.” And veterinarian Alice Neuticle who coined
the word “neuticles” —cosmetic testicles for a dog that’ s been
neutered.

So I’ m not asking for credit. Or cash. Since money had been called
“dough” and then morphed into “bread,” | figured that “toast”
would be the next logical step in that particular linguistic evolution, but my
campaign itself became toast, in the sense that “toast” now means

history.

Also, | was intrigued by the process of having a body part named
after oneself. How proud Casper Bartholin’ s parents must have been to
have a son who christened the source of female lubrication that takes the
friction out of intercourse as “Bartholin’ s glands.” But my idea of
calling those two vertical lines between your nose and your mouth

“Krassner’ s crease” just never became popular.
