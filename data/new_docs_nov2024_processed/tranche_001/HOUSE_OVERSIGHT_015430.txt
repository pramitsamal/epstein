It took the team only six months to design and build the satellite,
which was launched in December 1958 by an Atlas rocket that weighed
9,000 pounds. “The satellite payload became famous for the tape-
recorded message from President Dwight Eisenhower, who insisted that
this project remain top secret,” George tells me. “He said the launch
would be aborted if any word leaked out, because he didn’ t want a
chance of failure to tarnish our image. As it turned out, one of the two
tape recorders did fail, but his Christmas message to the world was the
very first transmitted message from space.”

Eisenhower stated: “This is the president of the United States
speaking. Through the marvels of scientific advance, my voice is coming to
you via a Satellite circling in outer space. My message is a simple one.
Through this unique means, | convey to you and all mankind America’ s
wish for peace on earth and good will toward men everywhere.”
