As set forth in Dershowitz’s Motion for Clarification of Confidentiality Order or Relief
from that Order, filed Jan. 29, 2016, it appears that Roberts made false statements in a publicly
filed affidavit about being present at a private island in the US Virgin Islands when former

the request “strongly establishes that former President Clinton was not present on Little St.
