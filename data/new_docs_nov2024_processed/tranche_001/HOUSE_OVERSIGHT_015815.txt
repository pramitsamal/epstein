The Brain 125

Tubulin

where the light comes from since tubulin is housed deep within the
neurons inside our brains and shielded from light by our skull. It turns
out that the mitochondria which powers our bodies emit photons of UV
light as a waste product of their metabolism. The speculation is tubulin
harvests this waste energy.

Before we argue for this mechanism any further we still need to
establish that a non-computational mechanism is needed to allow human
thought. In the next chapters, we will look at the nature of knowledge
and, in particular, mathematical creativity and the Wiles Paradox.
