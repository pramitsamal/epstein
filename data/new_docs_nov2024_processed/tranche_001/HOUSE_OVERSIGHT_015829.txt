Knowledge 139

The foibles of spell checkers have long been a personal pain to me
because of my dyslexia. Although I can see the red underlining Microsoft
Word kindly inserts so liberally into my text, I can’t easily see the occasions
when I use ahomonym. A fine poem illustrating the problem was kindly
written by Jerrold H. Zar and published in The Journal of Irreproducible
Results. It hangs on the wall behind my computer to remind me to check
for these errors.

Candidate for a Pullet Surprise
By Jerrold H. Zar

I have a spelling checker,

It came with my PC.

It plane lee marks four my revue
Miss steaks aye can knot sea.

Eye ran this poem threw it,
Your sure reel glad two no.
Its vary polished in it’s weigh.
My checker tolled me sew.

A checker is a bless sing,

It freeze yew lodes of thyme.

It helps me right awl stiles two reed,
And aides me when eye rime.

Each frays come posed up on my screen
Eye trussed too bee a joule.

The checker pours or every word

Too cheque sum spelling rule.

Bee fore a veiling checker’s

Hour spelling mite decline,

And if we’re lacks oar have a laps,
We wood bee maid too wine.

Butt now bee cause my spelling

Is checked with such grate flare,
Their are know fault’s with in my cite,
Of nun eye am a wear.
