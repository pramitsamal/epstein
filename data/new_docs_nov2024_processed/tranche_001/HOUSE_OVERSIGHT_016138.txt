Population growth Decreasing Direct impact through lower number of expatriates and national birth rate
Public sector wage growth Flat to contracting Freeze in government wage bill

Private sector wage growth
Saudi private sector male employment

Flat to minor increase
Mixed

Some sectors to contract (construction), others resilient (retail, staples)
Saudization helps, but economic slowdown and supply-side factors impact negatively

Saudi private sector female employment Increasing NTP aims to increase it through several measures
Consumer leverage Decreasing Banking sector liquidity and lending standards are tightening
Real estate finance Increasing NTP measures are supportive in this area

Specialized Credit Institutions (SCls) Flat SCls can continue to support the economy

Saudization Increasing Negative impact short-term, positive impact medium-term
Subsidies Decreasing Timing and breadth unclear as of yet

Banks and contractors will require supportive policies to realize NTP benefits

The banking sector is targeted to benefit from the NTP initiatives through greater

disintermediation (SMEs, real estate financing, non-oil export financing) and greater

household savings. However, domestic liquidity is likely to remain structurally tight, in

our view. The NTP targeted increase in non-oil fiscal revenue is likely to tighten

domestic liquidity, all else being equal, as it would have the effect of extracting

resources from the non-hydrocarbon private sector (as opposed to government

domestic spending that injects liquidity).

Linked to liquidity trends and banking sector asset quality, the issue of government
arrears to contractors is likely to take centre stage, in our view. Resolving this is likely to
be required if the capex projects under the NTP are to be executed on a timely fashion,
in our view. We think the government’s proposal to issue | Owe You' notes (IOUs) could
be a step in this direction.

Government looks to issue |OUs

According to the press, the Saudi government has paid contractors some cash on its
arrears, and is considering to issue | Owe You' notes (IOUs) to them. Contractors would
receive these notes to cover their outstanding dues, which they could hold until maturity
or sell on to banks. The government has been highlighting it wanted to settle the
contractor sector dues, and recently a high-profile domestic contractor has made mass
redundancies. In the previous downturn in the 1980s, arrears to domestic contractors
were also likely to have been accumulated. We highlighted that the fiscal deficit was
likely under-reported last year. Also, construction was one of the fastest growing sector
last year both in terms of domestic activity and of domestic credit.
