Epstein also hired Bruce Reinhart, then an assistant U.S. attorney in South
Florida, now a U.S. magistrate. He left the U.S. Attorney’s Office on Jan. 1, 2008,
and went to work representing Epstein’s employees on Jan. 2, 2008, court records
show. In 2011, Reinhart was named in the Crime Victims’ Rights Act lawsuit,
which accused him of violating Justice Department policies by switching sides,
implying that he leveraged inside information about Epstein’s investigation to
curry favor with Epstein.

Reinhart, in a sworn declaration attached to the CVRA case, denied the
allegation, saying he did not participate in Epstein’s criminal case and “never
learned any confidential, non-public information about the Epstein matter.”

The U.S. Attorney’s Office has since disputed that, saying in court papers that he
did possess confidential information about the case.

Contacted for this story, Reinhart, in an email, said he never represented Epstein
— only Epstein’s pilots; his scheduler, Sarah Kellen; and Nadia Marcinkova,
described by some victims as Epstein’s sex slave. Reinhart also pointed out that a
complaint filed against him by victims’ lawyer Paul Cassell was dismissed by the
Justice Department.
