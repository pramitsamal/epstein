Judge Ruth Pickholz was flabbergasted. She couldn’t understand why the DA would want to go easy on Epstein, after the New York State
Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders recommended the Level 3 status because there was more than just the one victim for which he

pleaded guilty.

“I have to tell you, I’m a little overwhelmed because | have never seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this,” the judge said at the

hearing.
Despite the DA’s arguments, Pickholz slapped Epstein with Level 3 status, which was upheld on appeal.

“The strong evidence that the offenses against the other victims did occur outweighs any inferences to be drawn from the manner in which
this case was prosecuted in Florida,” the New York Court of Appeals said in its ruling.

When asked for comment, the DA’s Office referred The Post to court documents stating that the prosecution's position was based “largely
on the mistaken notion” that only the formal charges against Epstein could be factors in the decision.

The jet-setting financier has been making headlines in recent days after Virginia Roberts, 30, claimed he pimped her to Britain’s Prince

Andrew.

Prince Andrew has denied the accusations against him.
