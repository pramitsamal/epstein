District Attomey of New York County, and I submit this affirmation on behalf of the People
in response to a motion filed by non-party movant NYP Holdings, Inc. (the “Post”) to
“unseal” the appellate briefs from 2011, pertaining to the adjudication of defendant Jeffrey
E. Epstein as a Level III sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act (“SORA”).
Civil Rights Law § 50-b pécviles that the identities of the victims of sex offenses must
remain confidential and that documents bearing identifying information should not be wale
available for public inspection. Despite those protections, the Post seeks copies of the
-appellate briefs, with the names or initials of Epstein’s sex crimes victims redacted, for use in

reporting about the procedural history underlying defendant’s SORA adjudication.
