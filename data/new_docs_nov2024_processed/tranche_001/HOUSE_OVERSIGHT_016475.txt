brief with redactions of the names or initials of Epstein’s victims.1 However, if this Court is
inclined to grant the Post’s motion, we would not oppose producing a copy of the People’s

brief, with substantial redactions necessary to protect the identities of the victims but keeping

' According to the Post’s filing, they have contacted defendant’s currerit counsel, who has
reserved the right to oppose the disclosure of defendant’s appellate brief.
