RE: Private Irrigation Water Supply Systems

DATE: January 22, 2009

Town staff was asked to look into what it would cost for a typical Palm Beach homeowner to construct
their own independent irrigation water supply system. This is not an easy question and would take a
fairly detailed analysis from one of our water consultants that time and funding has not permitted. Town
staff has had several discussions with our consultants and the results of these discussions revealed the
following.

- A 12 acre site in Manalapan constructed its' own water supply system using Floridan Aquifer, total
price, between $400,000 and $450,000.

- Floridan water well permits for individual owners are possible, but wells cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars to construct due to the 1200 to 1400 foot depths. These wells are not necessarily drought proof.

- Shallow salt water wells are possible and would provide a water supply that would not have
restrictions. Dig too shallow, and the water will be aerobic and hydrogen sulfide is present, requiring a
chlorination system. Dig deeper, you would get to an anaerobic zone that avoids the hydrogen sulfide.
These salt water aquifers will require a higher degree of treatment, costing more than a Floridan source.

- Treatment facilities will need to be sized to irrigation demand. To minimize treatment capacity,
storage is needed. A pressurized system will need to be built. If requested, several scenario's can be
developed and priced.

- Electrical service and treatment facility housing needs will be tailored to the system design.

- Ballpark, the cheapest systems will likely exceed $100,000 with ongoing operation and maintenance

costs,
