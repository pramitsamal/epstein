104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *93

In 2006, Epstein's acts of abuse came to the attention of the Palm Beach Police Department, which began investigating the case.
195 At this point, once again, the victims would not have had rights under the proposed CVRA test. The CVRA extends rights in
the federal criminal justice process. A state investigation does not trigger the CVRA (although it may trigger certain state law
protections, as discussed below). !%°

At some point in 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department asked the FBI to investigate Epstein on federal sex offenses, such as
using a means of [*94] interstate communication in connection with sex offenses and traveling in interstate commerce for the
purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minors. !97 The local police provided the FBI with information, which the
FBI then investigated. Following an investigation, the FBI determined that the allegations of abuse against Epstein were
credible, and it presented the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida. In 2007, the Office
contacted counsel for Jeffrey Epstein and began negotiating a resolution of the case against him. 78

Under our proposed test, the victims would not have had CVRA rights the first moment that the FBI became aware of Epstein’s
possible commission of sex offenses. But after the FBI developed substantial evidence of those sex offenses, identified victims
of those offenses, and presented the case to the appropriate U.S. Attorney's Office for prosecution, CVRA rights would have
attached. Accordingly, the FBI would have been required to notify the identified victims of their rights under the CVRA (as
well as under the VRRA). From that point forward in the case, the victims would have had CVRA rights, such as the right to
fair treatment and the right to confer with prosecutors. In this case, the victims would have had the right to confer with

prosecutors about the nonprosecution agreement that they ultimately reached with Epstein. 1°?

C. CURRENT DEPARTMENT POLICY ON PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS

One objection that might be made to the formulation offered above is that it might unduly burden federal law enforcement
officers and prosecutors, who would need to make judgment calls about when an investigation has coalesced to the point where
victims are in existence, substantial evidence has been collected, and notice of rights has to be provided. Any such
objection would be ill-founded, though, as it does not appear that implementing such an approach would be difficult. 7°
Presumably the Justice Department has already been providing such rights in at least Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to
comply with the Fifth [*95] Circuit's 2008 ruling in In Re Dean, which held that the CVRA extends rights to victims before

defendants are charged. 7°! We have not seen any reports that providing the rights has been difficult.

Perhaps the reason for the lack of any reported difficulty is that the Department's current policy on crime victims' rights already
requires notices to victims during investigations. The Justice Department has promulgated the Attorney General Guidelines for
Victim and Witness Assistance, the latest edition of which is from May 2012. The Guidelines discuss crime victims’ rights
under both the CVRA and the earlier VRRA. Because of the OLC memorandum discussed above, the Guidelines limit CVRA

200 This Article does not discuss mass victim cases in which notice needs to be provided to hundreds of victims. But in such situations, the
CVRA already provides for reasonable alternative procedures. /8 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(2) (2012). The Department of Justice, for example, has
used websites to provide notice in terrorism cases to large numbers of victims. See, e.g., United States v. Ingrassia, No. CR-04-0455ADSJO,
2005 WL 2875220, at 4 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2005); Criminal Division's Victim Notification Program, U.S. Dep't of Justice,
