was no ‘international sex-trafficking operation’ and there was never evidence that Mr. Epstein
‘hosted sex parties’ at his home”. (Exhibit 10).
G. Dershowitz’s Lies

53. From the beginning, Dershowitz and Epstein have sought to hide their crimes
behind a curtain of lies. In response to Roberts’ description of Dershowitz’s participation in
Epstein’s sex trafficking, Dershowitz began a series of intentional, outright lies designed to
distance himself from Epstein, to cover up his own wrongdoing, and to discredit Roberts and
intimidate her into silence.

54. Dershowitz’s repeated lies are compelling evidence both of his lack of credibility
and his guilt. Only a person seeking to conceal improper conduct would have engaged in the
pattern of lies which has characterized Dershowitz’s statements since his sex trafficking was
revealed.

55, In attempt to conceal his relationship with Epstein, Dershowitz in January 2015
asserted that “my relationship with him was entirely professional. It is a total bum rap to say that
I...was ‘chummy’ with him”. (Exhibit 11). That was a lie, as Dershowitz and Epstein knew (see,
e.g., paragraphs 34-35).

56. Both to conceal Dershowitz’s relationship with Epstein, and to discredit Roberts,
Dershowitz has repeatedly asserted that he was only at Epstein’s residence once in Palm Beach,
and that was with his family. However, Juan Alessi, a long time Epstein household employee,
has confirmed that Dershowitz visited Epstein “pretty often. I would say at least four or five
times a year” and that he would “typically” stay two or three days. Similarly, Alfredo Rodriguez
who worked for Epstein approximately only six months confirmed that during that six months

period Dershowitz visited Epstein twice.
