other. Wars are notorious for yielding unintended and unexpected
consequences; for reasons explained below, a war against Iran is even
harder than usual to bound analytically.

Complexity, Uncertainty and War

Our first consideration in analyzing the likely course of war with Iran
is that a U.S.-led attack would be merely the first phase of a war, the
opening act of an extended drama whose scenes would unfold, not
according to any script, but to an emergent logic of its own. Given
the political context in which military engagement would rest, even a
minor attack would likely become a major test of strength involving
not only the United States and Iran but also a host of allies and
associates. It is therefore disingenuous to try to frame military action
against Iran as a simple “raid” or even a broader “operation.” We are
talking here about war, with attendant potential high costs to all
combatants in terms of military casualties, civilian damage and
economic disruption.

At least three concepts are key to any coherent discussion of a U.S.-
Iranian military engagement: complexity, uncertainty and war itself.
By complexity we mean the number of moving parts in a given
situation: actors, processes and the connections among them. By
uncertainty we mean structural uncertainty—that is, not just
ignorance of the magnitudes of agreed casual factors, but the
ignorance of the causal factors themselves, and their mutual relations.
For example, not only may the U.S. government not know, say, the
technical status of the Iranian nuclear program, or the actual state of
readiness of Iranian forces. It may not know (or worse, have wrong)
the decision-making and implementation protocols of the Iranian
government, how the Iranian people and military would react to an
attack, what Tehran would ask its allies and proxies to do, and what
in fact they will do.
