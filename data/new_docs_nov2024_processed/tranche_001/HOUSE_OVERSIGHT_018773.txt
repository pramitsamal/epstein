Development on the Strip

With approximately $21 billion in high-profile developments completed since 2008, the Strip has attracted significant investment capital
from both ownership entities that already possess a significant stake in the future success of the Strip and new capital sources seeking to
benefit from Las Vegas’ exceptional long-term fundamentals. Resort and casino ownership is largely consolidated among operators that
are devoted to continuing to increase visitation levels by upgrading the Las Vegas experience.
