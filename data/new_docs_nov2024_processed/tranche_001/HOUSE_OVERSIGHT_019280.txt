BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

tions of regimes that have been sullied by the jailing of
dissidents or opposition leaders, the shuttering of media

generally because of other strategic concerns or simple
neglect, not because lobbyists have persuaded them

outlets, or violent attacks on peaceful demonstrators.

Is the money that authoritarians allocate for image
beautification well spent? Some campaigns have been
more successful than others, but autocracies that

hire well-known former cabinet secretaries or elected
officials to defend or deny their acts of repression often
fail to sway either the public or the policy community

in the United States. If democratic leaders have not
mounted adequate responses to such repression, it is

that the regime in question is benevolent and just.

Authoritarian efforts to change governments, as
opposed to perceptions, may ultimately prove more
rewarding. Russias wager on the rise of friendly
European populist parties already seems to be paying
off. After Britain's vote to withdraw from the EU and
the triumph of Donald Trump in the United States,
the prospect of radical shifts in global politics can no
longer be dismissed as unthinkable.
