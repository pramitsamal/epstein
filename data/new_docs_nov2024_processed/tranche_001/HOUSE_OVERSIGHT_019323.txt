the former leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on
Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta.
Without forgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: If it works in Italy, we can
import the model anywhere”.

The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019.
In short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But
in the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also
because the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff
and published in the scandal book “Fire and Fury”. “Better to reign in Hell than to serve in
Paradise,” Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost
Paradise. Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The “army of
darkness” is already among us.
