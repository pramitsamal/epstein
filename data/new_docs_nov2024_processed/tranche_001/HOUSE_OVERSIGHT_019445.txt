world that will allow researchers
to re-create and study how a com-
plete ecosystem, such as Arctic
tundra or boreal forest, responds
to climate change. The Biotron,
Hiiner says, is “as close as you
can get to nature [in a lab].”
The Biotron will help integrate
biology into the scientific study of
global warming. Existing climate
change models, says Hiiner, are

moreover, they describe changes

species, or individuals. Scientists
haven't been able to create pre-
dictive models, for example,
of how changes in rainfall and

researchers tested in two sepa-
rate “missions” whether humans
could live sustainably in a sealed,
self-contained environment as
a precursor to colonizing outer
space. The Biotron, scientifically
speaking, is in a different league.

The superlaboratory is a
joint project of the University of
Western Ontario, the University
of Guelph, Ontario, and Agricul
ture and Agri-Food Canada, a
federal agency. The nondescript
five-story building, located in the
agricultural heartland of south-
western Ontario, is an engineer-
ing marvel, yel a bargain al just
U.S. $28 million.

Inside are state-of-the-art fa-
cilities that support research into
microorganisms, insects, and
plants, afl of which can be geneti-
cally modified to suit research-
ers’ needs. Temperature in the

yields in the U.S. grain belt or
butterflies in the Amazon basin,
because, with a few exceptions,
they haven’t had the tools to
measure the impact of climate
change on living organisms.

Now there’s a place where
whole ecosystems can be scrupu-
lously re-created and organisms
scrutinized, from their DNA to
their interaction with other organ-
isms. With more complete data,
scientists will be able to make
better predictions—and their ex
perimental findings could better
inform policy makers, who might,
for example, provide subsidies for
crops thatrespond well to emerg-
ing climate patterns.

The Biotron may call to mind
Biosphere 2, the large artificial
habitat plopped down 20 years
ago in the Arizona desert, where

Biotron’s climate chambers can
be varied from —40 degrees Fahr-
enheit to 122 degrees, to simulate
anything from the Arctic winter to
a tropical rainforest. On the reof of
the building are six “biomes”——air-
locked, preenhouselike structures
that have been custom designed
to precisely control environmental
factors such as ternperature, UV
radiation, light intensity, wind, pre-
cipitation, and CO;, Each biome is
large enough to house trees more
than 30 feet tall and to allow for
the re-creation of complex biologi-
cal communities that can extend
from the highest tree canopies to
underground soil layers.

If the possibilities seem end-
less, they nearly are. The plan is
for the world’s leading scientists to
rotate in and out of the lab space,
and the biomes will be regularly
reconfigured. One such setup will

use cross sections of Arctic perma-
frost, transported from northern
Canada, so researchers can study
how it reacts to rising tempera-
tures: As the permafrost thaws,
how much methane gas will be
released? How will bacteria and
overwintering insects be affected
by changing freeze-thaw cycles?
Scientists will design and study
more temperate ecosystems,
as well, to learn how changes
in temperature and CQ» affect
the growth of photosynthetic
organisms, including crops and
boreal forest,

Biotron researchers will also be
able to study the benefits and risks
of biotechnology in agriculture,
forestry, and medicine by examin-
ing the basic biology of genetically
modified organisms: What is the
rate of gene transfer from trans-
genic plants to wild ones? Can
plants be engineered to manufac
ture medicinal compounds that
will benefit humans?

The Biotron will be equipped
with a sophisticated imaging and
analysis system—a virtual control
room—that will expand its reach
globally, allowing researchers
anywhere to manage and moni-
tar experiments remotely over
the Intemet in real time. A scien-
tist in India studying the impact
ot climate change on rice could
instruct the Biotron to raise the
temperature or CO, concentra-
tion in a biome set up to simulate
a South Asian rice paddy. Then he
or she could monitor the impact
of this change through images
and other data automatically col-
lected and stored in a supercom-
puting network.

Researchers will vie for access
to the Biotron in much the same
way that physicists compete te
use the world’s few particle accel-
erators or astronomers the latest
and biggest optical telescopes.
Like them, itis a place for frontier
science, where old models will fall
and new and unexpected ones will
arise—excenpt that the goal is not
to understand our cosmic origins
but to influence our destiny.

members of the group baught
hundreds of eels, frogs, and
turtles from the city's China-

the state's Department of

strict rules for the release of

and the group now faces fines
for illegally introducing inva-

They Didn’t
Mean That

IN OUR FALL 2007 ISSUE,
Howard Frumkin of the
Centers
warned that global warming
was “perhaps the largest
looming public health chal-
lenge that we face.” On
October 23, Frumkin’s

boss, CDC director Julie
Gerberding, testified about
climate change ta the Sen-
ate Environment and Public
Works Cammittee. By the
time Bush administration
officials were done review-
ing her 12-page draft, it had
been slashed to six. Among
the statements cut: “The COC
considers climate change a
serious public concern.”
