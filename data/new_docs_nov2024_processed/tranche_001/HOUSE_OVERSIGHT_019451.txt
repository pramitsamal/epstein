and economic situation. It experienced a massive 7.0 earthquake and several subsequently large
tremors, which led to the deaths of many citizens in January 2010. Currently, the country is
experiencing problems with cholera, AIDS, high crime rates, high unemployment, and high
illiteracy among other things. According to CIA Factbook Report (2010), 80% of the population
lives “under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty”.
