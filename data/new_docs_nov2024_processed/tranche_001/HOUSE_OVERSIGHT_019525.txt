Eleu Street in the middle-class suburb of Waipahu. It was part of
the Royal Kunia development, which contained three hundred
similar-looking homes. According to Albi Matco, the manager of the
community association for the development, many of the residents
worked at military facilities in the area. The corner house Snowden
rented was comfortable enough, with three bedrooms, a walk-in
closet, a living room with a high ceiling, and a single-car garage, but

April 2, 2012, which entailed a brief separation from his girlfriend,
Mills, who had committed herself to attending a girlfriend’s wedding
the following month. After he left for his new assignment, she wrote
on Instagram, “Sex toy party and then saying goodbye to my man—
well not goodbye so much as see you in two months.”
