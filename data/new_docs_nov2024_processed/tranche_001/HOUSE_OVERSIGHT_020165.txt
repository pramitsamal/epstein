Nor did Snowden’s breach begin with him handing over classified documents to the Guardian
reporters in Hong Kong in June 2013 or, for that matter, in the eleven days prior to his meeting
with journalists in 2013. He had, as the NSA quickly determined begun illicitly copying
documents in the late summer of 2012. Such an enterprise does not emerge from thin air. Even if
he had managed to elude American intelligence from late May to early June 2013, he could not
hide all the history that led to his decision to come to Hong Kong. There had to be an envelope
of reality surrounding it, including Snowden’s motivation, associates, movements, finances, and
his activities prior to his fleeing to Hong Kong. What was missing was not just Snowden’s first
11 days in Hong Kong but the entire context of the alleged crime. I now needed to fill in that
envelope of reality in America. I left Hong Kong for New York on June 2, 2014 two days after

my meeting with the former official of the consulate.
