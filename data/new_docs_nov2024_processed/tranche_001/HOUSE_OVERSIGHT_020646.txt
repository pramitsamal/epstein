Chinese-Language Media Landscape

Official and Semi-Official Chinese-Language Media

By 2018, all of the major official Chinese media outlets had embedded themselves

deeply into the communications and broadcasting infrastructure of the

United States.

CCTV or CGTN (English and Chinese), the semiofficial Hong Kong-based
Phoenix TV, and a few Chinese provincial TV channels are available in add-on
packages of two major satellite TV providers in the United States, DISH Network
and DIRECTV. CCTV channels (English and Chinese) are in the cable systems of

all the major metropolitan areas of the United States.

The major official Chinese TV networks, including CCTV and major Chinese
provincial TV networks, and the quasi-official Phoenix TV, are all in the
program lineups of Chinese TV streaming services that have become popular
among Chinese communities in the United States. There are four major Chinese
streaming services in the United States: iTalkBB Chinese TV (##4##), Charming
China (#42 '7HI), Great Wall (R444), and KyLin TV (RBS). All these services
carry the major official Chinese TV channels, including major provincial

channels, and are accessible nationwide.

The major official Chinese media organizations, CCTV (CGTN), Xinhua, the
People’s Daily, and China Daily (the only major official newspaper in English),
have a heavy presence on all major social media platforms of the United States
and have many followers. All these outlets use Facebook and Twitter and other

platforms, even though those platforms are blocked in China.

Quasi-official Phoenix TV (AB), a global TV network with links to the PRC’s
Ministry of State Security and headquartered in Hong Kong with branches around
the world, including the United States, also has a substantial presence on all the

major social media platforms in the United States.
