PPACA —

There Is Potential for ‘Unintended’ Consequences

e The new law changes some system incentives, which may lead to new behavior
patterns, many of which are complex and hard to predict.
— The market may adapt to new MLR (Medical Loss Ratio) rules that incentivize
and reward a very specific (but ultimately arbitrary) cost structure.
— The cost/benefit analysis for employers and consumers may change, and
some may opt to re-evaluate their current employer-sponsored coverage
offerings.

e Health plans that are no longer economically viable may exit markets, potentially
adding to the uninsured problem prior to 2014.

e Likely acceleration in consolidation of payers as well as providers.

Historical Anecdote — “An Accurate Economic Forecast Might Have

Sunk Medicare & Medicaid [in 1965]”

* In 1965, the official estimate of Medicare’s costs was $500 million per year,
roughly $3 billion in 2005 dollars.*

* The actual cost of Medicare has turned out to be 10x that estimate.

- Medicare’s actual net loss (tax receipts + trust fund interest — expenditures)
has exceeded $3 billion (adjusted for inflation) every year since 1976 and
was $146 billion in 2008 alone. In other words, had the original estimate been
accurate, the cumulative 43-year cost since Medicare was created would
have been $129 billion, adjusted for inflation.

- Infact, the actual cumulative spending has been $1.4 trillion** (adjusted for
inflation)...in effect, 10x over budget.

* While calculations have been flawed from the beginning for some of USA Inc.’s
entitlement programs, little has been done to correct the problems.

An accurate economic forecast might have sunk Medicare.
