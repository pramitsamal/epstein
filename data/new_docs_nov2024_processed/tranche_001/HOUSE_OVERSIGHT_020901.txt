However, More Recent Healthcare Entitlement Such as Medicare

part D Has Cost Less Than Expected

Medicare Part D (the 2006 outpatient drug benefit for seniors) was projected to
cost $111 billion annually.

e In 2009, Medicare Part D’s actual cost = $61 billion, 45% below projection.

e The government originally projected 43 million beneficiaries in 2009, but only 33
million seniors (23% below projection) elected to participate in 2009.

Medicare Part D was outsourced to the private sector, and seniors elected to
enroll in plans operated primarily by managed care organizations, which utilize a
variety of techniques to reduce costs and improve the quality of care.

e The Washington Times stated on August 16 2010 — The lower cost - a result of
slowing demand for prescription drugs, higher use of generic drugs and fewer
people signing up - has surprised even some of the law's most pessimistic
critics.

e The Part D experience has given some observers hope that PPACA will not cost
more than anticipated.
