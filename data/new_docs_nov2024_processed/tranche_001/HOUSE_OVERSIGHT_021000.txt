Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Effectiveness Research Could Improve

Efficiency (i.e., Outputs Track Inputs)

e Comparative Effectiveness evaluates different options for treating a condition for a
specific set of patients’

— Either relative benefits and risks of various treatment options (technology
assessment, evidence-based medicine), or

— Both clinical effectiveness and relative cost (cost-benefit analysis).

e Without rigorous data about comparative effectiveness, according to the CBO:

— Treatment decisions often depend on anecdotal evidence, conjecture, and the
experience/judgment of involved physicians.

— Treatments and types of care vary widely from one area of the country to another.
e To affect healthcare spending meaningfully, comparative effectiveness must alter

doctor and patient behavior, potentially through reimbursement scheme changes, the
CBO notes.

e Note that by law, Medicare is effectively precluded from considering costs when

making coverage decisions.
