herself that there's a factual basis for the

allegations?

A. Something along those lines, sure.

Q. As a general matter, you agree with that
proposition?

A. Yes, sure.

Q. Would you agree that the scope of the
investigation, the reasonable investigation an attorney
must do, varies depending upon the nature of the

allegations being made?

A. Sure, yes.
