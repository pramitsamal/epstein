formal complaint at the time. But she had taken the cop’s card,
and now he was happy to hear that she'd changed her mind.

In a shaky voice, Alicia described Epstein as a tallish man—
five feet eleven or six feet in height was her guess—with gray

Mercedes and was a regular at Shutters on the Beach, which was
the kind of place that cost one thousand dollars a night and was
frequented by actors, agents, and other Hollywood types.

Alicia told the cop that she was a model and actress herself.
She'd known Epstein for about a month. They had a friend in
common, and she’d sent him her head shots.

Then, through an assistant, Epstein had invited her to meet
in his room at the hotel.

Alicia said she was having reservations, the officer wrote in his
report, because generally interviews are not conducted in hotel
rooms.

According to her, things turned frightening quickly.

She was unsure she was safe because although she wanted to
land the job as a ‘Victoria's Secret’ catalog model she felt as

fessional manner for 4 model.

Epstein wore navy blue sweatpants and a white T-shirt, she

recalled. The T-shirt had the letters USA printed on it in patriotic

red, white, and blue.

Epstein told her to undress and actually assisted her to do so
while saying ‘let me manhandle you for a second.’
