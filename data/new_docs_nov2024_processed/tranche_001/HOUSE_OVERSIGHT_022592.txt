Conclusion

CONCLUSION

The FCPA was designed to prevent corrupt practices, protect investors,
and provide a fair playing field for those honest companies trying to win busi-
ness based on quality and price rather than bribes. Following Congress’ leader-
ship in enacting the FCPA 35 years ago, and through determined international
diplomatic and law enforcement efforts in the time since, laws like the FCPA
prohibiting foreign bribery have been enacted by most of the United States’
major trading partners.

This guide is designed to provide practical advice about, and useful in-
sights into, our enforcement considerations. For businesses desiring to com-
pete fairly in foreign markets, it is our goal to maximize those businesses’ ability
to comply with the FCPA in the most effective and efficient way suitable to their
business and the markets in which they operate. Through our ongoing efforts
with the U.S. and international business and legal communities and non-
governmental organizations, DOJ and SEC can continue effectively to protect

the integrity of our markets and reduce corruption around the world.
