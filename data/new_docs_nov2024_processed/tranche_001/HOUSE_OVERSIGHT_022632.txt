Is any one surprised? Who wants any of these evil spirits back in the White House?

They do not call him “slick” willy for nothing. Short of an actual photograph or video of him engaging in sex
with a child there is no way he will get this pinned on him. Just remember how many people (40-50) connected
to him and “her” that have lost their lives (murdered) and he’s never been prosecuted.

As much as I would like to see him and his carpet munching wife brought down it is just not going to happen, at
least this way it’s not...
