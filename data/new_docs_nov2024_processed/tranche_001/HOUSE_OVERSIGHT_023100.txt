The movie is a multigenerational compendium of comedians, from Phyllis Diller and Don
Rickles to George Carlin, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Sarah Silverman and Cartman of
South Park. But the raunchiest participants are often those best known for their roles in
family-friendly sitcoms on network TV: Drew Carey, Jason Alexander, Paul Reiser. I
asked Mr. Saget, who starred as a lovable widower father in the long-running hit Full
House, where his own impulse to tell X-rated standup comes from. Among his reasons:
There's something about all of us that wants to push the limits of the world we're in,
where you can't say anything. There's a time and a place for stuff that is freeing for
people.

I'm not a particular enthusiast for dirty jokes, but that freedom is exactly what I, and I
suspect others, felt when a comic with a funny voice in a bad suit broke all the rules of
propriety at that Friars Roast. But it was just three days earlier at the White House that
Ari Fleischer, asked to respond to a politically incorrect remark about 9/11 by another
comedian, Bill Maher, warned all Americans to watch what they say. That last week in
September 2001, I've come to realize, is as much a marker in our cultural history as two
weeks earlier is a marker in the history of our relations with the world. Even as we're
constantly told we're in a war for freedom abroad, freedom in our culture at home has
been under attack ever since.
