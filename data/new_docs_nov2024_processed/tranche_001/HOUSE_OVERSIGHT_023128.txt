U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta has been criticized for the plea deal he
worked out with Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta was U.S. attorney for Southern Florida at
the time. Alan Diaz

Instead, Epstein — whose friends included President Donald Trump, former
President Bill Clinton and other politically connected people — was allowed to
quietly plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court. He served 13 months in
the county jail, where he was allowed liberal work release privileges rarely given to
sex offenders in Florida and barred by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Department’s own
rules.

are still fighting more than a decade later to have his non-prosecution agreement
overturned.

becoming collateral damage in Washington’s latest polarized conflagration,” adding,
“I won't let it happen without first being heard.”
