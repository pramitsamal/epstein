brother Zahar are wrong, and do not represent the position of the
Hamas movement or any of its institutions. They represent a violation
of the organizational traditions followed by Hamas, and are not
worthy of being issued against the leader or leadership of the Hamas
movement. He added that Dr. Zahar is not authorized to comment
on the statements made by the leader of the Hamas movement...the
political bureau is the only institution that is authorized to issue any
clarification or explanation on the statements issued by the
leadership.

Despite his strong statements, Izzat al-Rashaq denied that Zahar's
statements reflect a state of disagreement or division within Hamas,
stressing that there is no disagreement within Hamas, the movement
is highly united, and its decisions are one.

Senior Hamas official Dr. Salah al-Bardawil confirmed to Asharq Al-
Awsat that the Hamas movement is united, saying that some media
outlets are trying to convince the public that there is division within
the ranks of Hamas. Al-Bardawil also stressed that Hamas figures
have the right to issue their statements using whatever language they
wish so long as they are expressing their own views and ideas, and
this does not mean that there is a split in the Hamas movement's
decision.

Dr. Bardawil also stressed to Asharg Al-Awsat that Hamas is under
the leadership of Khalid Meshal, adding that Hamas is a resistance
movement that believes that resistance is the means of liberating
Palestine, especially after it has became clear to everybody that it
would be a terrible gamble to bet on these futile negotiations.
