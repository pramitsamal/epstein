150 Teaching Minds

In many ways this remark is as dumb as her early remarks. Why do I
think this?

Because it makes it clear that she hasn’t a clue, and doesn’t really
care, about causation.

And, this is exactly the problem with Sarah Palin’s remarks to
Katie Couric as well:

Couric: .. . people have questioned your readiness since that
interview. And I’m curious to hear your reaction.

Palin: Well, not only am I ready but willing and able to serve as

the important thing here is that John McCain and I, we share
a vision for America that includes energy independence.

Why do I think that the problem here is about a misunderstanding of
how to determine causation? Miss South Carolina has determined the
following things to be true:

If students can’t do something, they should be taught to do it.

If students can’t do something, it is because they weren’t taught

able to do, then it should be taught in school.

Reading maps is more important than whatever would have to
be eliminated from school so that reading maps could take its
place.

These decisions should be made on the basis of statistical
evidence of student’s abilities.

But is any of this reasonable? Not only could one argue with each of
these propositions, but it is fair to say that Miss South Carolina herself
doesn’t know that she holds these positions, that she hasn’t thought
about them, and that she might disagree with what she said if some-
one pointed this out to her.

In other words, she cannot reason well precisely because her be-
liefs indicate that she does not think about causation, and one can
