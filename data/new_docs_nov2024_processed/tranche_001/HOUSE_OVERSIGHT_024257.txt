lll. Class Requirements

The purpose of this class is to give students a sense of the historical battles of the Internet, what
different actors were thinking, what they were trying to accomplish, and what levers they pulled
in order to select for specific outcomes. Students should apply what they have learned from
historical examples to a current Internet issue discussed in class and describe in a 12-15 page
paper what a viable solution might look like. Solutions could take the form of a policy
recommendation, project proposal, or code. The paper or project proposal will be due on
Friday, January 20th, and may be submitted by email to Samantha Bates at
sbates@law.harvard.edu.
