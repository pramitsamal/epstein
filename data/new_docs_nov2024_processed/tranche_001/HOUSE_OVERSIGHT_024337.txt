value is more leveraged to future value appreciation and depends upon a future increase in the value of our common stock. The committee also has
determined that restricted stock unit grants to NEOs should be used for the purposes of retention or recognition of outstanding performance in part because
restricted stock units are less volatile than stock options.

2018 Annual Grant

For fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee determined to award an equal blend of time-based stock options and restricted
stock units to provide a mix composed of awards whose value depends upon a future increase in the value of the common stock (time-based stock options)
and awards that serve primarily as a retention tool (time-based restricted stock units).

For the 2018 annual grant, the committee targeted a grant value equal to the amount of each executive’s base salary. The committee initially
targeted the annual grant based on a 10-day average stock price as of April 2, 2018 ($21.61). Based on that price, Mr. Garcia would have received 15,988
options and 9,255 RSUs; Messrs. Jenkins and Huston would have received 14,989 options and 8,677 RSUs; and Messrs. Keeton and Gill would have
received 13,190 options and 7,635 RSUs. However, the grants were not awarded until mid-July when the stock price had more than doubled ($44.21). To
compensate the executives for the disadvantage of receiving stock options with a much higher exercise price, the Committee determined to grant additional
RSUs. The grant value of the additional RSUs is equal to one-half of the in-the-money value difference between the options granted based on the March
stock price and the options granted based on the July stock price, resulting in a total of 13,987 RSUs granted to Mr. Garcia, 13,113 to Messrs. Jenkins and
Huston each, and 11,540 to Messrs. Keeton and Gill each.

2018 Special Performance-Contingent Grant

For fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee and the Board also granted a one-time special performance-contingent RSU
award for driving exceptional company performance to achieve an important milestone in the development of the business. The RSUs were granted on
April 30, 2018, to the NEOs other than the CEO; the CEO received his award on May 1, 2018. Mr. Garcia was granted 14,572 RSUs ($393,298 grant
value), Messrs. Jenkins and Huston 13,662 RSUs ($358,081 grant value), and Messrs. Keeton and Gill 12,022 RSUs ($315,097 grant value). All of these
grants will vest 100% on the date of the first periodic report filed where positive quarterly EBITDA is reported. None of the RSUs were vested as of the end
of 2018.

2018 100k Milestone Gift

On September 10, 2018, we announced a commitment by our chief executive officer, Emest Garcia III (“Mr. Garcia”), to contribute 165 shares
of Class A common stock to us from his personal shareholdings for every one of our then-existing employees, including the NEOs, upon their satisfying
certain employment tenure requirements. In connection with these contributions, we have made corresponding grants of 165 restricted stock units under our
2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan to each employee who has satisfied the requirements and we intend to make grants to the remaining then-existing employees
as they satisfy the requirements (the “100k Milestone Gift” or “Gift’). Messrs. Jenkins, Huston, Keeton, and Gill all received the grant in 2018, which had a
grant date fair value of $10,562.
