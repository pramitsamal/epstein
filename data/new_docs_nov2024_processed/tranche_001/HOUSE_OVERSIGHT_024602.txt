Sinai’s Bedouin run amok in post-
Mubarak Egypt

Mohamed Fadel Fahmy

AUGUST 24, 2011 -- The landscape of Egypt's lawless North Sinai
governorate is punctuated by the bullet-riddled, torched police station
of Sheikh Zuweid, a densely populated town roughly nine miles from
the Gaza border. It is just one of the security buildings that has fallen
victim to the long-running clashes between the military and the
Bedouin tribes of the region, clashes that have only escalated since
Egypt's revolution. Hosni Mubarak's regime branded the Bedouin, a
largely nomadic and clan-based people, as outlaws who threatened
Egyptian sovereignty. As his rule collapsed in February, and
afterward, the Bedouins sought retribution against the security
services that long oppressed them, attempting to carve out a degree of
autonomy in the region. The unrest has turned into an economic
headache for Egypt's new military rulers: The pipeline that supplies
AQ percent of Israel's natural gas has been bombed five times since
the revolution, halting the country's natural gas exports. But more
importantly, Sinai has become a breeding ground for Islamist
extremism and violence that -- barring a dramatic improvement in
relations between the Bedouins and the central government in Cairo --
threatens Egypt and the region at large. Sinai's lawlessness recently
sparked an international incident: On Aug. 18, gunmen carried out a
string of attacks in southern Israel that left eight Israelis dead. The
Israeli government, which claimed that the attackers were militants
from the Gaza Strip who had crossed into Israel through the porous
Sinai border, retaliated by launching attacks in both Gaza and Egypt.
