Comparison of U.S. Stock Markets

Cannabis Investment Report |

December 2017

U.S. stock markets vary significantly in terms of their financial, liquidity and corporate governance

requirements. Most U.S. publicly traded cannabis-related companies trade on the OTC due to its less

stringent requirements, as compared to Nasdaq and the NYSE. The following chart provides a com-

parison of Nasdaq, the NYSE and the OTC.
