COWEN'S COLLECTIVE VIEW OF CBD - AHEAD
OF THE CURVE SERIES

THE COWEN INSIGHT

In a collaboration featuring 11 analysts spanning Cowen's consumer, health care, industrials
and regulatory teams, we offer a deep dive on the global cannabis market, with a particular
emphasis on the U.S. For consumer goods, we believe the U.S. CBD market could represent
a $16 bn opportunity by 2025.

$16 bn Consumer Opportunity (Azer, Blackledge, Charles, Chen & Kernan)

In our monthly proprietary consumer survey (n = ~2,500) we were surprised to see that
nearly 7% of respondents in January 2019 reported using CBD as a supplement. This strong
consumer interest is validated by the growing number of brands and form factors that are
now available through increasingly diverse retail channels, including Amazon, Sephora and
Neiman Marcus. That said, consumption of CBD on-premise will likely take longer, given
regulatory uncertainty. And, while our analysis primarily focuses on consumer staples
applications for CBD, it is interesting to see a growing number of specialty apparel brands
embrace hemp as a sustainable textile.

Retail sales of CBD consumer products in 2018 have been estimated between ~$600 mm
and $2 bn. By 2025, we believe CBD offerings could conservatively generate $16 bn in retail
sales (assuming a ~40% increase in consumer incidence, to 10%, and spend of less than $2 /
day). Our bottom-up analysis anticipates a diverse category, that is still led by traditional
health & wellness form factors (e.g., $6.4 bn in nutraceuticals, and $4 bn in topicals). And,
while likely smaller, we also expect categories like food, beverages, beauty and vapor to all
generate sales between ~$1-2.5 bn by 2025.

Herein, we offer a detailed look at category brand and pricing architecture in the U.S.

CBD market today, as well as detailed discussions of 21 public and private operators that
currently have exposure to the category, including Outperform rated Canopy Growth, Tilray
and Turning Point Brands, which have all announced plans to enter the U.S. CBD market.

The Science of CBD (Nadeau)

Cannabis’s therapeutic potential is attributable to the valuable overlap between
phytocannabinoids (i.e. plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid
system in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake.” While THC's activity in the body is
fairly well elucidated, CBD’s pharmacokinetics are less well understood (no specific receptor
for CBD has been identified). Clinical trial results to date demonstrate few adverse effects
from oral CBD doses of up to 1500 mg/day or up to 30mg IV. The scientific understanding
of CBD’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in specific indications, like epilepsy. GW
Pharma’s Epidiolex (highly potent, pure formulation of CBD) was approved by the FDA in
2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet
syndrome, and other companies (Tilray, MMJ Phytotech, Insys) have clinical trials underway
in seizure disorders as well.

CBD Hemp Cultivation (Neivert)

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 41 states have set up cultivation
and production programs to regulate the production of hemp. There is little research on
CBD hemp cultivation methods as hemp cultivation research historically has focused on
fiber and grain/seed. This lack of research, combined with a number of variables that affect
hemp for CBD yield, makes hemp for CBD cultivation much more art than science at this
point. That said, no other crop in the U.S. offers the type of return of the CBD Plasticulture
Model, and we would thus expect the country's two largest crops, corn and soybeans, to
lose some acreage to CBD hemp.
