Consumer Products Market Sizing (Azer)

In our proprietary Cowen consumer survey (~2,500, 18+ respondents), we found that in
January 2019 close to 7% of respondents indicated that they use CBD as a supplement.
While this is only the first month’s reading of the data (which can fluctuate from month
to month), this initial response piqued our interest considerably, as it was much higher
than we would have suspected. Indeed, to put the 6.9% incidence rate in context, that
compares to JUUL use of 4.2%, and 19.6% of consumers that consider themselves a
current tobacco user, per our survey.

From a user perspective, category engagement not surprisingly skews younger, with use
among 18-24 and 25-34 year olds at over 9%, while it is below 4% for consumers 55+.

While the category remains nascent (with revenue estimates ranging from $600 mm to
S2 bn in 2018) it seems clear that the abundance of choice, which we discuss in more
detail herein, has been a key driver of that consumer engagement. In particular, we
were surprised to see that beverages already account for close to 20% of reported form
factor use, given that this segment is among the newer offerings in the market place.
Meanwhile, tinctures, which were arguably one of the original delivery systems, has a
dominant 44% share.
