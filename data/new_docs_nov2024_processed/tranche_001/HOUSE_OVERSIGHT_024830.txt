Sensitivity Analysis For CBD Plasticulture Model. As shown below, there is a significant
change in return for every $1 change in price per CBD%. A deterioration of this pricing
with no corresponding change in cost would impact CBD production. Breakeven for the
model above is ~$9/Ib for dry matter yield compared to the $30/Ib used to calculate the
margin over variable cost per acre used. While price % CBD can fluctuate, the second
factor determining the dry matter yield/Ib price is CBD%.

CBD Hemp Clearly An Attractive Option For Growers. No other crop in the U.S. offers
the type of return of the CBD Plasticulture Model. We would expect the two largest
crops in the U.S.: corn and soybeans to lose some acreage to CBD hemp, though given
corn and soybean area planted was 89.1M and 89.2M acres respectively in 2018. (Total
planted acres in the U.S. is ~320M acres.)
