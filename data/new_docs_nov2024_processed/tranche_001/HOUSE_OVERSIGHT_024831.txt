Kentucky Hemp Growth Provides An Indication For Near-Term Acceleration

Figure 7 shows hemp production in Kentucky under Kentucky Department of
Agriculture (KDA) Industrial Hemp Research Pilot Program. The figure shows the
increase in planted acres in 2018 (Sept) as well as the shift toward CBD as a percentage
of total hemp (planted acres for CBD rising to 4,121 acres in 2018 from 864 in 2017). In
2018, there were 158 greenhouses in Kentucky representing 764,000 sq. ft., which is
included in the 2018 acreage below. (Note 1 acre = 43,560 sq. ft.)

On January 22, 2019, the Kentucky Department of Agriculture approved 1,035
applications to cultivate up to 42,086 acres of industrial hemp in 2019, up from 16,100
acres in 2018 and 33 acres in 2014, which was the first growing year. (67 acres of
greenhouse space was also approved for hemp cultivation.) We note that of the 16,100
acres approved in 2018, less than half (6,700) was planted.

Outlook For Growth

The expected growth for hemp is supported by the economics offered. However, there
are limitations related to required cultivation methods.

Conversations with industry experts estimate planted hemp acres in 2019 could reach
200,000, up from 78,176 in 2018. The growth is supported by expansion like Kentucky's
and new states entering the market (only 23 states participated in 2018).
