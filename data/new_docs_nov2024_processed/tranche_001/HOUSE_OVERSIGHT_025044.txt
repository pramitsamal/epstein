remaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan
within the next year. But officials said the
withdrawal would be weighted toward
year’s end, leaving most of the troops to
partner with Afghan troops for much of this
year. The president said the United States
would support democratic transitions in the
Middle East, “keep the pressure on [the]
Syrian regime” and “do what is necessary
to prevent” Iran from obtaining a nuclear
weapon — but he offered no specifics.

Mr. Obama pressed his case for reform of
immigration laws and for action to slow
global warming — and, in especially
moving terms, tougher gun laws. In each
case, there may be measures he can take
through executive action, but new laws will
be needed for substantial progress.

Mr. Obama was right when he pointed to
the survivors and grieving relatives of gun
violence victims and insisted, “They
deserve a vote.”
