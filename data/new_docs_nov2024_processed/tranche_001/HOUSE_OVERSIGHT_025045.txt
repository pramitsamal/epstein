February 13, 2013 -- If you want to know
what an American president's foreign
policy is likely to be, particularly in a
second term, don't listen to his State of the
Union speech. You'd probably have more
luck playing with Tarot cards, or reading
tea leaves or goat entrails. But not this year.
Barack Obama's fourth such address left a
trail of foreign-policy cookie crumbs that
lead directly to some pretty clear, if hardly
surprising or revolutionary, conclusions.
His first term contained no spectacular
successes (save killing Osama bin Laden),
but no spectacular failures either. And
more than likely, that's what the president
will settle for in a second, even as the Arab
world burns and rogues like Iran and North
Korea brandish new weapons. He's nothing
if not a cautious man.

Behold: I am the Extricator in Chief

Afghanistan -- the good war -- has been
pretty much MIA in Obama's speeches
since he became president. He's alternated
between spending a few words on the
mission there (2009) or a paragraph (2010,
2011, 2012). If his words have been brief,
the message has been stunningly clear: It's
about the leaving. And tonight was no
exception. Not more than two minutes in,
the president spoke about America's men
and women coming home from
Afghanistan.
