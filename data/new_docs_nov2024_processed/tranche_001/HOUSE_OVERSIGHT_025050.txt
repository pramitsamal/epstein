housing market and rising employment,
and of course if some broader deal can be
struck on entitlements and taxes.
Immigration reform and gun-control
legislation driven by a functional
bipartisanship would cement that legacy.
He'd be an historic rather than a great
president.

Two clocks tick down in a president's
second term: the drive for legacy and the
reality of lame duckery. Obama's political
capital will diminish quickly. Where, how,
and on what he wants to spend it 1s critical.
The Middle East is violent and volatile and
may yet suck him in, but if he can avoid it,
he'll try. This was a State of the Union
address that stressed fixing America's
broken house, not chasing around the world
trying to fix everyone else's. The future of
America isn't Cairo or Damascus; it's
Chicago and Detroit.
