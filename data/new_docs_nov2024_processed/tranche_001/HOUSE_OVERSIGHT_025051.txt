12 Feb 2013 -- Negotiations with Iran are
once more on the international agenda.
After an eight-month break, the five
permanent members of the UN Security
Council plus Germany -- the so-called
P5+1 -- are due to hold a meeting with Iran
on 25 February in Kazakhstan. What are
the prospects of success? In a nutshell, that
would seem to depend more on the climate
in Washington than in Tehran. Iran is
gesturing that it wants to negotiate, but
Washington has not yet signalled any
greater flexibility than in the past.

In a major speech in Tehran last Sunday,
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
addressed the United States: “Take your
guns out of the face of the Iranian nation
and I myself will negotiate with you,” he
declared. Meanwhile, the Iranian
ambassador to Paris told French officials
that, provided a work plan was agreed, Iran
was ready to allow inspectors of the
International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) to visit Parchin, a military facility
where Iran is suspected of having done
work on atomic weapons. Ahmadinejad
himself has said repeatedly that Iran was
ready to stop enriching uranium to 20% if
the international community agreed to
supply it instead to the Tehran research
reactor for the production of isotopes
needed to treat cancer patients.
