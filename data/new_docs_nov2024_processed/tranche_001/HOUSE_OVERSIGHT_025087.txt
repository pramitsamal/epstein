There might be a political calculation
behind Qatar's decision to throw an amount
of money equivalent to two years of U.S.
financial aid to the PA behind a single
private-sector figure like Masri. Qatar
recently announced plans to invest nearly
$400 million in the Hamas-controlled Gaza
Strip, and in October of 2012, Qatari Emir
Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani
became the first head of state to visit the
Strip after the Islamist militant group's
2007 takeover. Hamas politburo chief
Khaled Meshaal lives in Doha, and Qatar
Diar is financing a major development in
Sudan, whose cash-strapped government
enjoys close relations with Iran, and has
facilitated the transfer of long-range
rockets to Hamas. In short, Qatar supports
an E.U. and U.S. listed terrorist
