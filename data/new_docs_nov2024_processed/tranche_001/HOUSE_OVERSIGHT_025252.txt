* Please note that the bar charts show total portfolio preferences and thus can
be interpreted as the recommended deviation from the relevant portfolio
benchmark for any given asset class and sub asset class.

The UBS Investment House view is largely reflected in the majority of UBS
Discretionary Mandates and forms the basis of UBS Advisory Mandates. Note
that the implementation in Discretionary or Advisory Mandates might slightly
deviate from the unconstrained asset allocation shown above, depending on
benchmarks, currency positions and for other implementation considerations.

Please see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.
