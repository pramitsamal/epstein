 Bitcoin’s 300%+ historical annual risk premium is idiosyncratic and cannot be explained by ISG’s multi-factor model.

= An inability to understand sources of risk and return makes one incapable of predicting when performance will reverse.

= For tactical hedge funds, half of the historical risk premium is explained by the factor model.
