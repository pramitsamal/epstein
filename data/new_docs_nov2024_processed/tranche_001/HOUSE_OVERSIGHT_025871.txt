OGIS sends “bouquets” of thanks to people inside and outside of Government.

(NARA Identifier 6728212)

We thank John Albanes, who was a student at the American University
Washington College of Law, who spent a semester volunteering his time at
OGIS.

Finally, we would like to thank the legions of FOIA professionals at
agencies who work with us on a daily basis and the hundreds of FOIA

requesters who seek our assistance.
