objects and processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably one of the top layers of the
learning hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not before. Classical

linguists ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely.

It seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because concepts are
shared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from the statistics of
language use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer what objects look like

and how they interact.

My own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The
request-confirmation networks that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are an
attempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs.

Cheers!
