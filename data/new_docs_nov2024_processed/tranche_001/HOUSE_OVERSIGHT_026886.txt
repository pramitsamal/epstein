RLK: So Trump recognizes that and
he is getting political credit for that
— whether people like it or not.

There's unlikely to be anything
before the midterms, but if
President Trump is doing what he's
doing, he needs to recognize that
these issues that I articulated are
really the critical issues. And China
will be willing to make changes on
them. They've already made
changes on many of them, like on
intellectual property rights, as I
said

RLK: . But if Trump can recognize
what is really needed and what
China will do, then Trump can get a
huge win out of this, which is
actually at the same time beneficial
to China. That's a small needle hole
at this point though which to look.
But I think, ultimately, that's what
will happen.

HOST: Robert Lawrence Kuhn,
thank you very much for your
expertise. I appreciate it.
