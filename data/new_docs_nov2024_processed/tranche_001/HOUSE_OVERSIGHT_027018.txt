But still — from the Palestinian side... no proper
response.

They clearly bear most of the responsibility for
past failures.

And | know, a fully fledged agreement is
probably not feasible today, But if this is the
case — and only a sincere effort can determine
this — we have to try and achieve a reasonable,
fair, interim agreement.

I strongly believe this is possible, while
guaranteeing all our security and vital interests.

But if even an interim agreement is
unobtainable, then we should consider
unilateral steps, in order to place a wedge on
this extremely dangerous slippery slope
towards a binational state.

It involves demarcating a line within the land of
Israel... Within which we will have the
settlement blocs and a solid Jewish majority
for generations to come.
