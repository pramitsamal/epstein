As well as setting security arrangements, and a
solid Israeli, long-term military presence along
the River Jordan.

Rest assured... our security should not — and
will not — be compromised under any of these
alternatives.

Tough decisions must be taken; but it is
possible.

And as our sages teach us: “/f not now...
when?”

I strongly believe that this intertwined strategic
triangle:

First, The Regional Security Framework

Second, a reinvigorated political process with
the Palestinians...

And third: tackling Iran.

This triangle, is the most effective approach to
deal with the challenges on our horizon.
