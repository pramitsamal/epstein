Future art stars cause a New Sensation

Twenty artists hailed as stars of the future are getting the chance to show their work alongside that of 60 masters,
from Picasso and Warhol to Manet, Rodin and Cézanne.

The 20 were chosen from hundreds of graduate students in the New Sensations Prize, a contest now in its fourth
year, organised by Charles Saatchi's gallery and Channel 4.

Their work is part of The House of the Nobleman, an exhibition of art borrowed from international collections
that is being staged in an 18th-century mansion in Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park, a stone's throw from the
Frieze Art Fair.

Four of the graduates were selected to receive £1,000 bursaries to develop a project for inclusion. They are:
German Pablo Wendel, 30, whose degree work involved squatting in a derelict chip shop to which he built a
staircase, later dismantled by Royal College of Art staff in a health and safety row; Katie Surridge, 25, and Russian
Nika Neelova, 23, both Slade School graduates, and Ross M Brown, 24, who is still studying in Dundee. One of
them will be named this year's overall winner on Monday and the exhibition runs until Wednesday.

Rebecca Wilson, associate director of the Saatchi Gallery, said: “The 20 shortlisted artists have created a stunning
range of work, including

photography, painting, installation and sculpture. The exhibition offers a wonderful opportunity to discover the
bright stars of the future.”

More than half of the graduate artists are based in the capital. “London is still one of the best places to do a fine
art degree and has that reputation across the world, as well as being one of the most vibrant centres for

contemporary art,” Ms Wilson added.

New Sensations at the House of the Nobleman, 2 Cornwall Terrace, is open until Wednesday.
