Force, that fought this great war, really the Judeo-Christian West versus atheists, right?
The underlying principle is an enlightened form of capitalism, that capitalism really gave
us the wherewithal. It kind of organized and built the materials needed to support,
whether it’s the Soviet Union, England, the United States, and eventually to take back
continental Europe and to beat back a barbaric empire in the Far East.

That capitalism really generated tremendous wealth. And that wealth was really
distributed among a middle class, a rising middle class, people who come from really
working-class environments and created what we really call a Pax Americana. It was
many, many years and decades of peace. And I believe we’ve come partly offtrack in the
years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we're starting now in the 21st century, which I
believe, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a

crisis of capitalism.

“T believe we’ve come partly offtrack in the

And we're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the
people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I
feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs,
but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that’s starting, that will completely
eradicate everything that we’ve been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years.

Now, what I mean by that specifically: I think that you’re seeing three kinds of converging
tendencies: One is a form of capitalism that is taken away from the underlying spiritual

and moral foundations of Christianity and, really, Judeo-Christian belief.
