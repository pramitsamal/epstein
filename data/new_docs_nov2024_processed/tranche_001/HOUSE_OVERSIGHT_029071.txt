Harnwell: The third-largest conservative news website is something to be extremely
impressed by. Can you tell for the people here who aren’t within the Anglosphere and they
might not follow American domestic politics at the moment — there seems to bea
substantial sea change going on at the moment in Middle America. And the leader of the
majority party, Eric Cantor, was deselected a couple of weeks ago by a tea party
candidate. What does that mean for the state of domestic politics in America at the
moment?

Bannon: For everybody in your audience, this is one of the most monumental — first off,
it’s the biggest election upset in the history of the American republic. Eric Cantor was the
House majority leader and raised $10 million. He spent, between himself and outside
groups, $8 million to hold a congressional district. He ran against a professor who was an
evangelical Christian and a libertarian economist. He ran against a professor who raised
in total $175,000. In fact, the bills from Eric Cantor’s campaign at a elite steak house in
Washington, DC, was over $200,000. So they spent more than $200,000 over the course
of the campaign wining and dining fat cats at a steak house in Washington than the entire

opposition had to run.
