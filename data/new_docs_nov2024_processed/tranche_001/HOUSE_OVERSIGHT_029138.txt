Equally important, discuss edits/modifications to the 13 episodes (cutting blahs), expanding math episodes -
see below. Assuming we expand math episodes, we will need more mathematicians.

How’s late afternoon after 5:30 pm / early evening today? - or weekend, day/times? (Family issues today -
mother 102 in May.)

RADICAL BREAKTHROUGHS - Initial Revisions (working model for discussion, red is new)

Expand and Modify Mathematical Breakthrough episodes
1. Mathematics and Truth / Overview / Show Excitement/Importance
2. Mathematical Fields / Diverse New Kinds and Categories

3. How Math Works in Disparate Areas of Knowledge (from fundamental physics to chemistry,
biology [molecular and evolutionary|, psychology, sociology, economics, etc.)

4. Power Laws
5. Mathematical Biology

6. Foundations of Mathematics / Philosophy/Meaning of Math (discovered/invented?)

ADD/Exchange to Biological Breakthrough episodes

9/10. Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability
in biomedical and psychological research - the scandal in recent years.

In the non-Closer To Truth world....

Did CNN Intl this morning on Trump’s China-oil-N.Korea-cheating tweet “Caught RED HANDED...”

My favorite fun lines (there are so many) in Trump's NYTimes spontaneous interview.

2) “TI like very much President Xi. He treated me better than anybody’s ever been treated in the history of
China.”

Ever (~5,000 year history)
1) “I know the details of taxes better than anybody — better than the greatest CPA.”
Not, mind you, CPAs in general, not even smart Jewish CPAs who work all the time - but whoever, out

of 664,532 actively licensed CPAs (2016), is the greatest CPA of them all (#1 in citing code? creative
deductions?) - better than him!
