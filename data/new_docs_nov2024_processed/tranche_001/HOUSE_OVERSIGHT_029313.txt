SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

Because of DOMA, same-sex married cou-
ples did not have the same benefits under
Social Security that opposite-sex married
couples have enjoyed for many years. Unlike
opposite-sex couples, for example, there are
no survivor benefits for the surviving spouse
of a same-sex married couple. Also, the di-
vorced spouse of a formerly married same-
sex couple cannot not claim benefits based
on the earnings of his or her ex-spouse.

IMPACT. The Social Security Adminis-
tration (SSA) has based federal rights to
benefits on whether marital rights exist
in the couples current state of residence
rather than the state in which they were
married. The impact of Windsor on the
manner in which federal agencies will
treat Social Security benefits remains to
be sorted out.

When an individual

dies, his or her surviving spouse may be

Survivor Benefits.

eligible for Social Security benefits if the
surviving spouse is age 60 or older, age 50
or older and disabled, or any age if he or
she is caring for the decedent’s child who is
younger than age 16 or disabled and enti-
tled to Social Security benefits on the record
of the deceased individual. With DOMA
having been struck down, survivor benefits
previously available only to opposite-sex
married couples are now presumably avail-
able to same-sex married couples. The SSA
is expected to provide guidance.

Divorced Spouses. If an individual is di-
vorced, his or her ex-spouse may qualify
for Social Security benefits based on that
individual’s earnings. Generally, a divorced
spouse must have been married to the in-
dividual for at least 10 years and have been
divorced at least two years. Additionally,
the divorced spouse must be at least age
62, unmarried and ineligible for an equal
or greater benefit based on his or her own
earnings or the earnings of someone else.
‘These benefits are now presumably available
to divorced individuals who were previously
in a same-sex marriage. The SSA is expected
to provide guidance.

Death Benefits. The SSA pays a one-
time death benefit of $255 to the dece-
dent’s surviving spouse in an opposite-sex
marriage or minor child. The SSA will
presumably now pay the one-time death
benefit to the surviving spouse in a same-
sex marriage.

EFFECTIVE-DATE ISSUES

Determination of the effective date for ap-
plying the Supreme Court's holding to fed-
eral tax law is not straightforward in all cases
and will necessitate further guidance from
the IRS. Same-sex married couples who
were not considered married under federal
law prior to the Supreme Court decision
are presumably not just considered married
starting on the date of the Supreme Court’s
decision, June 26, 2013 but are considered
married retroactively to the date of their
marriage pursuant to state law. This retro-
active effective date raises a number of im-
mediate federal tax issues:

m Should same-sex couples now file
amended returns claiming joint return
status?

m Are same-sex couples now required to
amend past-year returns for joint status
even if they did better tax-wise overall
by filing separately as unmarried indi-
viduals?

m Will the IRS consider the Supreme
Court’s decision in determining marital
status when auditing prior-year returns?

Amended Joint Returns/Claims For Re-
fund. Amended returns are filed to correct
errors made on previous returns. Although
the Internal Revenue Code does not specifi-
cally permit amended returns, the IRS usu-
ally accepts them. But while the IRS’s dis-
cretion to accept or reject amended returns
has been recognized, courts have required
the IRS to accept amended returns where
its rejection of them has been found to be
arbitrary and unjust.

Limitations Period. The statute of limita-
tions for amending or auditing a return is
