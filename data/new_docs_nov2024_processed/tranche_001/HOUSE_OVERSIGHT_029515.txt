mean this is coming from a Nobel laureate who discovered a particle, you know. So I
ended up where I began, which is non-dualism, that there is only consciousness.

Matt: Isn’t that idealism?
Deepak: Idealism comes out of non-dualism.

Matt: So there are two types of monism [non-dualism]. There’s materialism and then there
is idealism. [Each holds that] there’s only matter or there’s only consciousness.

Deepak: Okay then we can say idealism is closest to non-duality. They don’t use that word
in the East. Let’s go for lunch. [We head downstairs. ]

Deepak: With idealism one usually relates to Plato in the West or to Bishop Berkeley and
all those guys, you know. But basically, what idealism espouses, it’s mental. But non-
dualism says even mental is a construct. When you say mental you have words. As soon as
you have a word for an experience it’s no longer fundamental.

Matt: Non-dualism is a construct too.
Deepak: If I have to use words, yes.
Matt: There’s no getting away from constructs.

Deepak: No, there is a way of getting away from constructs. It’s called transcendence. Shut
up and just be.

Matt: We never stop filtering experience—

Deepak: Every experience is filtered through given constructs. There is no getting away
from it. But then we start looking at consciousness—let’s find our table. [We find our table. ]
