This is not to say that rationalism isn't important and good. It is. But left to itself without the guidance of higher
meaning and a higher concept, rationalism can be mean and incomplete. | say if you simply live on rational policy
and briefing notes you are not sufficiently informed.

You need a higher calling or some inner system of belief - here | mention Kant and the inner command that tells
you what is true, what is right, what is good. The inner command must be the divining construct in what you do.

Music has always been a large part of what makes me tick. You listen to a great work .. . you hear the majesty of
these works and your head and soul gets caught up in them. When that happens you are in for bigger things and
you will strike out to be better.

When | was listening to music | would always have the pad out to write the ideas down.
