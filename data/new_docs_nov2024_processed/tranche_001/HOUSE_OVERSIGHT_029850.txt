To compare the United States’ performance and leadership to Mexico’s, Japan’s and China’s is particularly ill-timed.
Trump might be stuck in a 1980s time warp on Japan. When his “The Art of the Deal” was published in 1987, Americans
were envious of Japan’s brilliant leaders, who were said to be outsmarting the United States at every turn. Since then,
Japan has become the poster child for economic stagnation and political paralysis. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been
unwilling or unable to get his promised reforms enacted, and the country’s economy continues to shrink.

Mexico is watching its growth collapse. While its president, Enrique Pefia Nieto, is a courageous and intelligent leader
who has made some very bold decisions, he has also made some significant missteps. Most important, the country was
ill-prepared for plunging oil prices that have battered government revenues and growth.

China has had three decades of supercharged growth and competent government policy. But in the past few years,
Beijing went on a borrowing binge, running up its total debt to levels that are unprecedented, according to Sharma. And
in the past two months it has made mistakes in managing both its equity markets and currency — mistakes that have
cost $400 billion, the Financial Times reports.

Of course, the United States has problems that are worrying, such as wage stagnation and low labor-force participation.
But the important comparison is not to some ideal fantasy of what America might be but to other countries in the real
world. And the facts show, Mr. Trump, we’re killing them .
