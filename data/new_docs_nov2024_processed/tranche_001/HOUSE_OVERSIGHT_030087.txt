feature in other Nusayri rituals, namely Ali, Muhammad, and Salman
al-Farisi (the Persian companion of Muhammad who in several
Islamic traditions forms a link between the Arabs and the wisdom of
ancient Persia). Nusayri rituals, performed in private homes or out-of-
the-way places, include a ceremony known as Qurban—almost
identical to the mass—where wine is consecrated and imbibed in the
Christian manner. As Matti Moosa, a leading scholar of the Nusayris,
states in his seminal study Extremist Shiites: The Ghulat Sects
(1988):

The Christian elements in the Nusayri religion are unmistakable.
They include the concept of trinity; the celebration of Christmas, the
consecration of the Qurban, that is, the sacrament of the flesh and
blood which Christ offered to His disciples, and, most important, the
celebration of the Quddas [a lengthy prayer proclaiming the divine
attributes of Ali and the personification of all the biblical patriarchs
from Adam to Simon Peter, founder of the Church, who is seen,
paradoxically, as the embodiment of true Islam].

Moosa suggests that like other schismatic groups residing in Syria,
such as the Druzes and Ismailis, the Nusayris do not take their beliefs
literally, but understand them as allegorical ways of reaching out to
the divine. While this may be true of the educated naqibs, or spiritual
elders, such belief systems may have different ramifications for
semiliterate peasants, reinforcing a contempt or disdain for outsiders
who do not share these beliefs. Like the Druzes and some Ismailis,
Nusayris believe in metempsychosis or transmigration. The souls of
the wicked pass into unclean animals such as dogs and pigs, while the
souls of the righteous enter human bodies more perfect than their
present ones. The howls of jackals that can be heard at night are the
souls of Sunni Muslims calling their misguided co-religionists to
prayer.
