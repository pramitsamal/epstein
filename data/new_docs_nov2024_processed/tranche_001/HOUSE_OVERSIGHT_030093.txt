In Aleppo, a jewel among cities, with its commanding citadel and
labyrinthine, covered souk, she sees fully veiled ladies, exotic
bedouin women displaying bright spots of color, and wealthy Gulf
Arabs wearing white robes rubbing shoulders with men riding
donkeys and mixing with “trophy girlfriends” in miniskirts teetering
perilously on the ultra-high-heeled shoes that Aleppans evidently
consider to be the height of fashion.

Having been in Aleppo recently, I can vouch for the accuracy of her
descriptions. Visiting several mosques, churches, and shrines, she
provides impressive testimony of the country’s religious diversity and
the regime’s commitment to religious freedom. It would be tragic if
the pursuit of democracy led to the shredding of this bright human
canopy, where religious and cultural differences seem to have
flourished under the iron grip of a minority sectarian regime.
