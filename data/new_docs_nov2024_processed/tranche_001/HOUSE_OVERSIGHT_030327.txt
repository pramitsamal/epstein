Political experts told The Oregonian on Tuesday that Roberts’ reply completely railroaded
his chances of unseating Walden in a race that was already said to be a longshot.

“If he wins, Pll sell my house and donate to charity,” joked Jim Moore, political science
professor at Pacific University.

Roberts is apparently known for making crude and outlandish remarks on Twitter, most of
which have been aimed at politicians.

“#NikkiHaley very hot,” he once tweeted, in reference to a TV appearance she made last
year.

“Important stuff,” Roberts added.

Describing Illinois Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, the independent candidate tweeted:
“Hot, tough & smart!”

Commenting on a video featuring President Trump, he said: “It looks like he’s morphing
into a woman, get that man a haircut and non fat chocolate cake!”

In response to the social media backlash he’s been receiving, Roberts refused to apologize
and instead cited the Constitution.

“It’s that whole 1st amendment thing,” he tweeted on Tuesday, along with an official
explanation from Twitter as to why his tweet about Melania hasn’t been taken down.

“We have investigated the reported content and could not identify any violations,” a
spokesperson said. “Accordingly, we have not taken any action at this time.”
