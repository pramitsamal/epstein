Jeffrey Sachs on the End of American Supremacy

Last month we were joined onstage by the University of Columbia economics professor
Jeffrey Sachs, as he laid out his radical new vision for U.S. foreign policy. Instead of a
world where America reigns as the sole superpower, Sachs argued for a new
international system of equals, where America shares power and collaborates with former

geopolitical rivals to solve today’s global crises.

Sachs was in conversation with the BBC’s Chief International Correspondent Lyse

Doucet.
