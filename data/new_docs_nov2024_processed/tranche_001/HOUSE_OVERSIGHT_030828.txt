almost inevitable. Subsequently, the conflict in Syria is dramatically impacting its
neighboring countries. More than a million of refugees from Syria have fled to

Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq.

Some critics, looking at the turmoil in Syria, Egypt, Lybia, claim that the warm Arab
spring has turned into a cold winter. Tunisia, for example, the first of the Arab
countries to overthrow their dictatorship, is on the edge of another civil war after
two political assassinations. It might take years until the situation in Syria stabilizes,
decades until the country turns into a genuine and a true democracy. If Americans
are to learn from their mistakes in Iraq and Libya, military intervention is off the
table. To stop Syria’s turmoil, the United States needs a new strategy aimed at
pressuring both sides into negotiating. Syrian conflict cannot be resolved by military
methods. The only way to end the war is through political dialogue. Providing the
rebels with weapons would only aggravate the situation and lead to more deaths

and casualties.
