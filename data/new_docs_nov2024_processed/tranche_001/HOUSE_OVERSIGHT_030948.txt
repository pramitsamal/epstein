Broward County government. They already believe there is. They are only trying to uncover evidence to
confirm their beliefs.

Walton's blanket defense of the Commission has made the Feds conclude he is a fool or co-conspirator.

The FBI just needs the evidence and not much of it. To quote the late Supreme Court Justice William .
Brennan: any prosecutor worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich.

This means all evidence, regardless of its ambiguous nature, will be interpreted to support their
assumption of wrongdoing.

_. They will be using software to go through millions of E-mail messages to look for key words. As Buddy,
has. quoted me: The 'E' in E-mail stands for evidence. .

So imagine the following scenario.

Six months from now they uncover an E-mail from the County Manager to Walton stating that
Commissioner X wants to know if the bid of company Y for new busses was correctly filled out. He
replies that it was.

Months later he has tay forgotten about the innocuous E-mail. Based on the merits, he happens to
rank Y's bid number one. = :

You can bet as sure as J: Edgar Hoover wore pink poodle skirts, the FBI will conclude this was code
from Commissioner X to Walton to vote for Y.

Armed with the E-mail you can be damn sure that the G-Men will be back threatening him with
. everything including a stint in Gitmo.

All of this might have been avoided if he had fallen my three basic rules.
Memorize them. |

1. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer.

2. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer.

3. Do not talk to the FBI without a law
