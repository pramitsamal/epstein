parlors strip clubs, and, also, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago. Just as the threats and enmity of the
two friends increased over the house sale, Epstein found himself under investigation by
local Palm Beach police. Epstein’s legal problems vastly escalated but the new Trump
property , with only minor improvements, was bought 3 years later in 08 , the time
Trump was facing his huge debt. for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev. a Russain oligarch.
That is, Trump had either miraculously earned $55 million, without putting up a dime, or
Rybolovlev, or someone such as Rybolovlev, paid Trump Properties, LLC—actual owner
unknown—$96 million, thereby providing a clean payment of $55 million to
someone. This at the very same time that trump was into Deutsch bank for over 600
million dollars but with a 40 millino personal guarnatee .Rybolovlev might have, in effect,
paid himself for the house, thereby cleansing the money. Epstein, on his part, would be
senetenced to 30 months, 12 of those months in jail on a prostitution charge.
After the election, when Bannon was introduced to Epstein, Bannon told him, “You were
the one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign.”
