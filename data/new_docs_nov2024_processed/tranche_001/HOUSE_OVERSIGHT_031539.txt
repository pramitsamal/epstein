Baylor loves its students. | love the students. We want them not only to be safe, but to flourish. We
worked hard to achieve that goal in a fallen world, where all too often, students will yield to temptations
all around them. We could always do more. And the silver lining of the nine-month ordeal culminating
in the events of May 2016 is that no university is more focused on Title IX-related prevention and
effective response than our beloved Baylor.

To be sure, there were failures and shortcomings. In particular, | lament the now-known fact that first
responders were, at best, insensitive to reports of sexual violence. But there are limits to what the
University can do with respect to OFF-CAMPUS behavior, especially when alcohol flows freely — and all
too frequently, it flows to tragic excess. But that jurisdictional point — off-campus drinking, not
infrequently under-age drinking — was deemed utterly irrelevant by American culture’s ultimate
mediator, the mainstream media, led in this instance by ESPN. Its provocative investigative reporting
avenue, “Outside the Lines,” had found a target on the banks of the Brazos. Several of us, including
Coach Art Briles, an honorable and decent man (and football genius) would be fatally hit by the media’s
unrelenting fusillade.
