The Davidic model exists primarily when there is no external
imperial power needing control of the Levant that is in a position
either to send direct force or to support surrogates in the immediate
region. The Persian model exists when Israel aligns itself with the
foreign policy interests of such an imperial power, to its own benefit.
The Babylonian model exists when Israel miscalculates on the
broader balance of power and attempts to resist an emerging
hegemon. When we look at Israeli behavior over time, the periods
when Israel does not confront hegemonic powers outside the region
are not rare, but are far less common than when it is confronting
them.

Given the period of the first iteration of Israel, it would be too much
to say that the Davidic model rarely comes into play, but certainly
since that time, variations of the Persian and Babylonian models have
dominated. The reason is geographic. Israel is normally of interest to
outside powers because of its strategic position. While Israel can deal
with local challenges effectively, it cannot deal with broader
challenges. It lacks the economic or military weight to resist.
Therefore, it is normally in the process of managing broader threats
or collapsing because of them.

The Geopolitics of Contemporary Israel

Let us then turn to the contemporary manifestation of Israel. Israel
was recreated because of the interaction between a regional great
power, the Ottoman Empire, and a global power, Great Britain.
During its expansionary phase, the Ottoman Empire sought to
dominate the eastern Mediterranean as well as both its northern and
southern coasts. One thrust went through the Balkans toward central
Europe. The other was toward Egypt. Inevitably, this required that
the Ottomans secure the Levant.

For the British, the focus on the eastern Mediterranean was as the
