Why Syria will get away with it

Gideon Rachman

June 13 2011 -- late last week, Robert Gates, the US defence
secretary, launched an offensive of his own. In a speech in Brussels,
he dismissed most of America’s European allies as a useless bunch of
timewasters. I paraphrase — but not much.

Mr Gates pointed out that while all Nato countries had voted to
intervene in Libya, most had chosen not to participate in the actual
fighting. Even those European countries that are taking part began to
run short of munitions just 11 weeks into the fighting — forcing an
exasperated America to step into the breach. More broadly, a
situation in which the US accounts for 75 per cent of the military
spending in Nato was “unacceptable” and unsustainable. If it is not

western military force can put the world to rights is coming to a
close.

Just a few weeks ago, that would have seemed a surprising
