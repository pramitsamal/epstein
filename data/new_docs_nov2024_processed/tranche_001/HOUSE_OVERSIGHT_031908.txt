SHAFFER: Don’t bioethics pose a challenge to the idea that the best
society is the most successful society? You argue in Our Posthuman
Future that a society that genetically engineered its children to be
more intelligent might be more productive and successful but
wouldn’t be moral.

FUKUYAMA: I’ve got a simpler concern in my current book. It’s
just that liberal democracy is not something you can take for granted,
or that democracies will find a way to solve their problems. I think
we’ ve got a number of long-term problems in the United States that
don’t seem to be getting addressed with the current political system.
