¢ Reaffirm support for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
on the basis of two states for two peoples and the right of the Jewish
and Palestinian peoples to self-determination, without prejudice to
the rights of all citizens and minority groups. Recall, in this context,
U.N. General Assembly resolution 181 of 1947 that called for the
establishment of a Jewish state and an Arab state.

¢ Acknowledge institutional and security reform, economic
development and state-building efforts — especially in the West
Bank, under the leadership of President Abbas and Prime Minister
Salam Fayyad, which have helped lay the foundations for Palestinian
statehood — and endorse the position articulated by the World Bank
and the United Nations that the Palestinian Authority is “well
positioned for the establishment of a state at any point in the near
future.”

¢ Accordingly, support the establishment of an independent and
sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 lines with its
capital in East Jerusalem in parallel with Israel’s recognized capital in
West Jerusalem, and with mutually agreed territorial swaps and
modifications, subject to negotiation — a state that will live side by
side with Israel in peace and security.

¢ Recognize that extending the authority of a Palestinian state to the
Gaza Strip will depend on effective control there by a legitimate
Palestinian government that exercises authority in the West Bank, is
committed to the Quartet principles and the Arab Peace Initiative and
respects the commitments of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

¢ Call for both states to engage in good faith negotiations on the basis
of this and previous relevant resolutions and agreements in order to
resolve all outstanding issues between them, beginning with the
issues of borders, settlements, water and security arrangements.
Specifically, security arrangements — including multi-layered
international, regional and bilateral guarantees — should confront
