and neutralize threats and enable the phased withdrawal of Israeli
forces from a demilitarized Palestinian state with an effective internal
security force and without compromising Israeli security.

¢ Note the importance of the Arab Peace Initiative, endorsed by the
Arab League in 2002, and call for regional states to assist in creating
an atmosphere conducive to negotiation and agreement, including by
intensifying efforts to advance coexistence and normalization of
relations between Arab League members and Israel.

A creative and courageous approach to leveraging the Palestinian
initiative will not end the conflict. But it could make it far more
manageable.
