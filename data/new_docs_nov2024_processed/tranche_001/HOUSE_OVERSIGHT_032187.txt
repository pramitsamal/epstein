yet been fully felt and is often undervalued. Iraq still draws undue
scepticism but production there is showing serious promise. The
country could add up to 300,000 barrels this year, with more
contracts, more exploration and more drilling already in the works.
Barring an unlikely and total implosion of the government, it is hard
to see production slowing down this decade. The same is true for
“tight oil” coming from unconventional sources. We are seeing this
begin to play out in North American fields such as the Bakken in
North Dakota. As technology and investment are dispersed over the
coming year, oil supply should positively surprise. Third, Saudi
supply increases are not dependant on Opec. The country’s oil
minister Ali Naimi left the cartel’s Vienna meeting earlier this month
with complaints that the organisation had just endured one of its most
contentious and least productive gatherings in many years. But that is
only because the major oil players were not prepared to pretend that
there was agreement on output quotas. With Iran chairing the
meeting, an annoyed Venezuela in attendance and an embattled Libya
looking on, it was much harder to get the group to put aside their
differences and smile for the cameras. The Saudis have the most
influence on price-moving output decisions and they increased
production just as they had planned before the meeting proved so
difficult. Economically stressed oil producers such as Iran and
Venezuela always want higher oil prices. But the Saudis and other
Gulf Co-operation Council producers maintain a longer-term
moderating outlook and they are the ones with the spare capacity to
make the difference. Add that to your favourite economist’s
projection on the softness of the global economy, and we may soon
be asking whether or not this latest IEA move was worth it.
