on her thong panties. Epstein then instructed S.G to give him a massage. As S.G gave Epstein a
massage, Epstein turned around and masturbated. S.G. was so disgusted, she did not say
anything; Epstein told her she “had a really hot body.” Jd. at 14. In the report, S.G. admitted
seeing Jeffrey Epstein’s penis and stated she thought Epstein was on steroids because he was a
“really built guy and his wee wee was very tiny.” Jd. at 15.

4, The exact number of minor girls who Epstein assaulted is known only to Epstein.
However, Edwards had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact believe that Epstein’s victims
were substantially more than forty (40) in number. In addition to the deposition excerpts from
two of his many victims above about the number of underage girls brought to Epstein and the
Palm Beach incident report, there is overwhelming proof that the number of underage girls
molested by Epstein through his scheme was in the hundreds. See Complaint, Jane Doe 102 v.
Epstein, (hereinafter Jane Doe 102 complaint) (Exhibit “B’’); see also Deposition of Jeffrey
Epstein, April 14, 2010, at 442, 443, and 444 (Epstein invoking the 5th on questions about his
daily abuse and molestation of children) (Deposition Attachment #6).

ae At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact
believe that Epstein and his attorneys knew of the seriousness of the criminal investigation
against him and corresponded constantly with the United States Attorney’s Office in an attempt
to avoid the filing of numerous federal felony offenses, which effort was successful. See
Correspondence from U.S. Attorney’s Office to Epstein (hereinafter “U.S. Attorney’s
Correspondence”) (Composite Exhibit “C) (provided in discovery during the Jane Doe v. Epstein

case).
