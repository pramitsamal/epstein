Affidavit of Bradley J. Edwards, Esq. at {1 - 2, §4 (hereinafter “Edwards Affidavit”) (Exhibit
32. On June 13, 2008, attorney Edwards agreed to represent E.W.; on July 2, 2008,
attorney Edwards agreed to represent Jane Doe; and, on July 7, 2008, attorney Edwards agreed to
represent L.M. in connection with the sexual assaults committed by Epstein and to insure that
their rights as victims of crimes were protected in the criminal process on-going against Epstein.
Mr. Edwards and his three clients executed written retention agreements. See id. at 42.

33. In mid June of 2008, Edwards contacted AUSA Villafafia to inform her that he
represented Jane Doe #1 and, later, Jane Doe #2. AUSA Villafafia did not advise that a plea
agreement had already been negotiated with Epstein’s attorneys that would block federal
prosecution. To the contrary, AUSA Villafafia mentioned a possible indictment. AUSA
Villafafia did indicate that federal investigators had concrete evidence and information that
Epstein had sexnatly molested many underage minor females, including E.W., LM, and Jane
Doe. See id. at 4.

| 34. Edwards also requested from the U.S. Attorney’s Office the information that they
had collected regarding Epstein’s sexual abuse of his clients. However, the U.S. Attorney’s
Office, declined to provide any such information to Edwards. It similarly declined to provide
any such information to the other attorneys who represented victims of Epstein’s sexual assaults.
At the very least, this includes the items that were confiscated in the search warrant of Epstein’s
home, including dildos, vibrators, massage table, oils, and additional message pads. See

Property Receipt (Exhibit “O”).
