Price stability can matter. The United States has managed to avoid double-digit
inflation since the Volker reforms of the 1980s. But the danger remains. Modigliani

was right to worry.

A law making real dollars legal tender might prompt better measurements of
inflation. Many economists agree that our official ones overstate inflation by
allowing two little for quality improvements. A Lexus or Tesla is nota Model A. That
was the theme of the Boskin Commission report to President Clinton in 1995. The
Boskin panel argued that quality-corrected inflation has run about 1.1% less than
the numbers posted in the consumer price index (CPI). | think so too. But making
real dollars legal tender, even by these imperfect measures, could still give more

confidence in long-term commitments than the status quo.

Speeding Up Fiscal Policy

Designating real rather than nominal dollars as legal tender would amount to an
unfamiliar and more direct form of monetary policy. Meanwhile devolution of banks
into their separate deposit and lending functions, along with emergence of omnibus

funds, need put no constraints on fiscal policy.

Fiscal policy has prescribed tax cuts and government spending in slumps. It
prescribes the opposite, at least in principle, in booms. A problem is that it has
proved slow to implement. There is an “inside lag” while government diagnoses the
problem and calls for a vote in the legislature. An “outside lag” follows until taxes
come due and spending programs are put together and gradually put plant and

people to work.

The inside lag is unavoidable in a democracy unless the executive branch, or an
independent agency like the Fed, is given standing limited authority to diagnose
early signs of unemployment, and to address them with tax cuts or spending. And
there must be enough outside lag to make sure that the medicine has good

prospects in rate of return. Return comes first.
