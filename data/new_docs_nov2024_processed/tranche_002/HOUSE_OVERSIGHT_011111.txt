National Wealth Including Human Capital

By definition, pure consumption rate is pure consumption divided by total capital.

This can be arranged as

pure consumption

total capital = (8.1)

pure consumption rate

Next generation theory modeled the pure consumption rate as 3.5% per year.
Historical data showed dividend and interest rates as more or less in this region
since Sumerian times. I model pure consumption as about three fourths of all
consumption. | take consumption as personal consumption expenditure (PCE) plus

government consumption expenditure (GCE) per the national accounts.

GCE includes government outlays, at all levels of government, on education and
welfare. These are easily recognized as consumption. It also includes costs of law
enforcement, national defense, fire control, and maintenance of infrastructure such
as highways and water systems and government buildings. These too count as
consumption, even if we mightn’t have thought so. They are part of the cost of our
survival. That’s why I agree with Kuznets and tradition, although | didn’t always,

that consumption includes all of GCE.
PCE in 2015 shows as $12.429 trillion. GCE is reported at $2.5855 trillion. Both are

in 2015 dollars. their sum is $15.0145 trillion. Three fourths of that is $11.2609
trillion. Then (8.1) gives

pureconsumption — $11.2609

total capital = = $321.74 trillion,

pure consumptionrate 035 / year

in 2015 dollars. This rough estimate can be borne in mind when we evaluate the tax

base and the risk of national debt. U.S. public and private debt together has been
