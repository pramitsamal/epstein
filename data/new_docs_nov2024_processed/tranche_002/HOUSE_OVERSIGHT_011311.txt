there. Although no allegations of trafficking or anything of
that nature, just that she was there. And they are seeking to
introduce evidence through Louie Freeh, who we'll discuss ina
moment, they've proposed, and he's clearly an expert that was
undisclosed, and through a FOIA record, and through the
articles to allege that he wasn't on the island.

And so in your Honor's order in 264-1, which is one of

the sealed orders, you did not allow us to depose him because
you said it was irrelevant.

So we're now in a position where at trial they want to

put forth that information against my client, and I don't have

an under-oath statement from that individual saying whether or

not he actually was.

Now, what we know is he flew with Jeffrey Epstein at

the same time 19 different times internationally and

nationally, but we don't have him with respect to this

particular allegation under oath. So we would say it would be
highly prejudicial for them to be able introduce evidence
saying that he wasn't there or that they have some proof or
some expert saying he wasn't there when, in fact, we weren't
able to ask him directly, the person who is at issue, under

oath, whether or not he did, in fact, go there.

So one of the streamlining of this case is that

allegation has nothing to do with sexual abuse, it doesn't have

to do with the statements
