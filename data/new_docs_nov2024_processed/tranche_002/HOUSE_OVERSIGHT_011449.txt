If you ever get the opportunity to watch the video of

these two witnesses, your Honor, it's remarkable because

there's a lot of eye rolling and facial expressions in response

to the leading questions by plaintiff's lawyers that, in my

analysis -- I may be testifying, your Honor, I must admit. But
in my observation, it was basically a nonverbal that's not

true and then the invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege,

and if that gets played for the jury, the jury can see that or

you can see it. At one point Ms. McCawley chided one of these
witnesses and said something like, you know, if you keep doing
what you're doing, we're going to have to do something else,
because she didn't like the facial expressions or the words
that the witness was using to invoke the Fifth Amendment

privilege. That's how much these folks could help Ms. Maxwell

but can't, and they can't because they're protecting their own
interests. They're not protecting Ms. Maxwell's interests.
They're worried that if the plaintiff's lawyers succeed in

Florida, they have some threat of prosecution, so they're not

going to testify. But again -- and this is, again, a point

that seems to be overlooked by plaintiff's counsel -- these two

by name. Ms. Maxwell is not, and Ms. Maxwell didn't choose to
