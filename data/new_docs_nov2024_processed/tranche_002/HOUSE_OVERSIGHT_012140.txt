Finally, as you know, Mr. Epstein and the USAO entered into an agreement that deferred
prosecution to the State. In this regard, I simply note that the manner in which this agreement
was negotiated contrasts sharply with Mr. Sloman’s current representation that “/T]he SDFL
indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration...” See Tab 1, May 19,
2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 2. This statement is simply not true. Contrary to Mr. Sloman’s
assertion, federal prosecutors refused to accept what the State believed to be appropriate as to
Mr. Epstein’s sentence and instead, insisted that Mr. Epstein be required serve a two-year term of
imprisonment (which they later decreased to 18 months plus one year of house arrest). Federal
prosecutors have not only involved themselves in what is quintessentially a state matter, but their
actions have caused a critical appearance of impropriety that raises doubt as to their motivation
for investigating and prosecuting Mr. Epstein in the first place.

At bottom, we appreciate your willingness to review this matter with a fresh—and
independent—set of eyes. To facilitate your review, I once again request the opportunity to
make an oral presentation to supplement our written submissions, and we will promptly respond
to any inquiries you may have.
