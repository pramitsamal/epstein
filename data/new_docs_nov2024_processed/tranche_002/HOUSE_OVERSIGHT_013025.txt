Fig. 6.1: High-Level Architecture of CogPrime. This is a conceptual depiction, not a

detailed flowchart (which would be too complex for a single image). Figures 6.2 , 6.4 and 6.5
highlight specific aspects of this diagram.

e Learning to build structures resembling structures that it’s shown (even if the available
materials are a bit different)

e Learning how to build bridges to cross chasms

Of course, the AI significance of learning tasks like this all depends on what kind of feedback
the system is given, and how complex its environment is. It would be relatively simple to make

of the project the goal is to have the system learn to carry out tasks like this using general
learning mechanisms and a general cognitive architecture, based on embodied experience and
