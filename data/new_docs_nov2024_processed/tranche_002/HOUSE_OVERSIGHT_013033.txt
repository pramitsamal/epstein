Fig. 6.2: Key Explicitly Implemented Processes of CogPrime . The large box at the
center is the Atomspace, the system’s central store of various forms of (long-term and working)
memory, which contains a weighted labeled hypergraph whose nodes and links are Atoms of
various sorts. The hexagonal boxes at the bottom denote various hierarchies devoted to recog-
nition and generation of patterns: perception, action and linguistic. Intervening between these
recognition/generation hierarchies and the Atomspace, we have a pattern mining/imprinting
component (that recognizes patterns in the hierarchies and passes them to the Atomspace; and
imprints patterns from the Atomspace on the hierarchies); and also OpenPsi, a special dynam-
ical framework for choosing actions based on motivations. Above the Atomspace we have a
host of cognitive processes, which act on the Atomspace, some continually and some only as
context dictates, carrying out various sorts of learning and reasoning (pertinent to various sorts
of memory) that help the system fulfill its goals and motivations.
