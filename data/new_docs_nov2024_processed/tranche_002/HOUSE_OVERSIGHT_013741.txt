Problems of measurement precision, amplified by the expansive actions of
systems that are sensitive to initial conditions, yield parameter sensitive entropies of
two (mathematically) fundamental kinds called topological and metric entropies, hr
and hw, proven to be the upper and lower bounds of any estimate of the entropy ina
uniformly expanding and/or equidistributed system (Adler and Weiss, 1965).
Measures of entropy, as “missing information related to the number of alternatives
which remain possible to a physical system” (Boltzmann, 1909), “index of
probability” (Gibbs, 1902) or the “amount of uncertainty associated with a finite
scheme” (Khinchin,1957) are obviously sensitive to the partition rules and its
fineness of the grain. The most theoretically defensible partition is called the
“generating partition” in which no box contains more than one point. Comparisons of
control and experimental data can be differentially sensitive to partition construction,
so that if a generating partition is not practicable due to sample length or dense
curdling in the point distribution, some arbitrary choices have to be made. These
have included naturally renormalized variational partitions, such that in one
dimension the boxes are defined by +1, +2, +3,...standard deviations, or quartiles or
quintile, above and below the mean and in n dimensions. Partitions have also been
constructed and used to described drug effects on rat exploratory behavior by
sequential partitioning along the dimension of the highest remaining variation (after
the previous partition) called the “KD” partition (Paulus et al, 1991). Partition
strategies to capture entropic measures on serial ordering (Klemm and Sherry,
1981; Strong et al, 1998) can grow from knowledge or hypotheses about the
physiological sources of temporal irregularities and discontinuities in brain dynamics
including characteristic interval(s) of refractoriness, relaxation times of the inhibitory
surround, correlation time in dendritic tree summation, the time course of reciprocal
inhibition and its decay and chemical influences such as the synaptic half-life and

time of action of inhibitory influences such as GABA on cell firing.

The logarithmic growth rates of occupancy of new symbolically indexed
boxes or, equivalently, the growth rates of visitations to old ones generating
unstable periodic orbits, are called topological entropies, hy . They record new

happenings, the growth rate of the diversity of orbits, and not how likely with respect
