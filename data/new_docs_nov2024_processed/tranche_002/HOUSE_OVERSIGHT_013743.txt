that procedures such exponentiation of a matrix can be carried out automatically
using computer algebra programs such as Maple or for data processing available as

computational modules in MatLab.

One of the techniques for the computation of hy involves determining the
logarithm of the asymptotic growth rate of the major diagonal (“trace”) in the
transition matrix symbolically encoding the trajectory which would therefore count
the “self visitations” of each indexed boxes as the dynamics proceed. This involves
setting up a transition incidence matrix, each box scored for a disallowed, 0, or
allowed, 1, transitions and the matrix is exponentiated t times with the logarithm of
the asymptotic growth rate of the sum of the diagonal values serving as a (leading
eigenvalue) estimate of hr. More technical considerations involving the Frobenius-
Perron theorem guaranteeing the existence of such an logarithmic index of new
information generation rates, even in random matrices (Seneta, 1981), will not be

discussed here.

We have found that computing hz in this way is empirically useful for difficult
to obtain or only transiently stationary brain data series. Even with relatively short
samples lengths, if one is willing to make the pragmatic assumption of “temporary
stationarity” or “things as they are right now will, for the sake of argument, go on
forever’ (perhaps the best we can do with intrinsically transient brain phenomena)
then this “freeze framed” representation of reality yields an asymptotic measure on
relatively short sample lengths since they are computationally infinite. A similar
approach to hy, requires repeatedly exponentiating a Markoff matrix constructed
from relatively short samples and generates the probabilistic (eigenvector) “dual” of
hr. hy computed in this way serves as a useful quantity, hy called by some the
Kolmogorov entropy in comparisons of control and experimental conditions of the
same sample lengths. Systematic decreases in hw (“Kolmogorov entropy”) have
been shown to accompany increasing “depth” of sleep using standard sleep staging
techniques (Gallez and Babloyantz, 1991) and increases in hy were associated with
both positive and negative emotional states induced by movies (Aftanas et al,
1997).
