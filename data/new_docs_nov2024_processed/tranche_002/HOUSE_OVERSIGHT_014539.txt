Since the trough of the global financial crisis in
March 2009, US equities have returned nearly
300%, producing one of the longest bull markets
in the post-WWII period and outperforming all
other major developed and emerging market
country equities. US equities have also exceeded
their pre-crisis peaks of October 2007 and March
2000 by 75% and 103%, respectively, on a total
return basis. This bull market has exceeded all
other bull markets but one in length and exceeded
all but three in magnitude.

US economic growth has also exceeded that of
most other recoveries in length. This recovery is the
fourth-longest recovery in the post-WWII period?
and if, as we expect, the US economy avoids a
recession in the first half of 2017, this recovery
will become the third-longest. While many critics
correctly point out that it is the slowest recovery
since WWII, it has actually created more economic
growth than some of the stronger recoveries
that lasted for shorter periods. On a cumulative
basis, this recovery ranks sixth out of the last 10
recoveries with respect to GDP growth. What this
recovery has lacked in strength, it has partially
made up for in length.

The slow but steady growth has also exceeded
that of all other major developed economies,
and US GDP per capita has increased more than
the GDP per capita of any major developed or
emerging market country.

This recovery has created over 15 million
jobs. The unemployment rate decreased from
a peak of 10.0% in October 2009 to 4.6% in
November 2016 and is now below its long-term
average of 5.8%. Even the broader U6 measure,
which adds the underemployed (such as part-
time and discouraged workers) to the number of
unemployed, has fallen from a peak of 17.1% to
9.3%, and stands below its long-term average of
10.6%. Unemployment claims are not only lower
than they were during pre-crisis troughs but also
at their lowest since 1973; they are also the lowest
on record as a percentage of the labor force (see
Exhibit 1).

As a result of more robust employment, wages
have increased as well. Wage growth, as measured
by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank Wage Growth
Tracker (which, in our opinion, is a better gauge
of the employment backdrop than average hourly

earnings, since it is not affected by the changing
composition of the labor force as new entrants are
hired at lower wages), has picked up from a low of
1.6% year-over-year growth in May 2010 to a high
of 3.9% in November 2016—just below the 4.4%
peak of September 2007. More robust employment
and better wage growth have, in turn, led to a
steady increase in consumer confidence, reaching
levels last seen in August 2001, as measured by the
