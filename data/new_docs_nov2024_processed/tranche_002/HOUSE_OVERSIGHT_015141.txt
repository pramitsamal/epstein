I' m ashamed of /ncreasing the military budget and decreasing the welfare
budget. |’ m ashamed of dropping cluster bombs and continuing to plant
land mines.

But the Republicans didn’ t dare attack me for any of those
positions because they are their positions too.

I’ Il tell you how | survived this past year, how | maintained such
high approval ratings, while Newt Gingrich fell by the wayside. How |
managed, in short, to remain president. It was partly the state of the
economy, and it was partly the state of the culture. Pornography is a
twenty-billion-dollars-a-year business in this country. Steven Spielberg
told me that’ s more than Hollywood’ s entire domestic box-office
receipts. Because it’ s what the American public wants. And the TV
networks exploit that dirty little secret. It' s why sweeps weeks are always
so raunchy. So, then, what /did wasn’ t considered such a big deal after
all.

Mainly, though, | have survived because, one sunny afternoon,
Monica was positioning herself on the carpet under my desk in the Oval
Office while | was on the phone with Benjamin Netanyahu. | was telling
him about the time that Monica was performing oral sex on me while

Yassir Arafat was waiting in the Rose Garden for our appointment. |
