tortured in this country--yes, this country that is so incredibly endangered
by the Unholy Trinity of corrupt government, welfare corporations and
evangelical religion. Incidentally, Sarah, wouldn’ t you agree that Rush
Limbaugh--infamous hater of the “feminazis” --was a sexist when he
boasted, “We’ re the ones with a babe on the ticket!” Inquiring minds
want to know. Likewise, wouldn’ t you agree that McCain was a sexist
when he was asked a question about Hillary Clinton during the primaries--
“How do we beat the bitch?” --and he replied, “Excellent question.”

And wasn’ t it sexist of him to vote against equal pay for women? Just
remember, Sarah, the only thing that John McCain wants more than to live
in the White House is to have a menage a’ trois with you and Cindy.
Good night and good luck.

SARAH: I’ Il tell you something, Todd. | feel like a human dartboard
for the media, but I’ m developing a thick skin.

TODD: | know what you mean. | say, “Oh, yeah, media? /C/utching
his crotch] Troopergate this!

SARAH: And you know what, the campaign spinners who feed the
media are just as bad. They’ re like the airport security people, who have

to spend all day looking at a screen in order to focus on potential threats
