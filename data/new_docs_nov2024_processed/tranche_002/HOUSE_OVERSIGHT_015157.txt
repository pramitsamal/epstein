marijuana joint, huh? It’ s legal here in Alaska. Did you know that? But it
has to be only one ounce or less. And then you have to smoke it in your
own house. |’ m gonna wait till I’ m thirteen before | try it. Bristol and
Levi smoke it when Mommy’ s out making a speech. If she was here,
she’ d smell it right away, so then they have to go somewhere else.
Mommy says, “Pot may be part of God’ s plan, but not in this house.”

She’ s always saying that something is part of God’ s plan, but | don’ t
understand what she means about that. Are hurricanes and train crashes
part of God’ s plan too? Anyhow, you’ re not supposed to smoke
anything when you’ re pregnant, right? Hey, Trig, you wanna hear what |
think would be a nice name for Bristol’ s baby? Diversion. | didn’ t think
of that by myself. | heard my teacher tell another teacher that Mommy’ s
baby is a diversion. | think it could be for either a boy or a girl. Hey, my
tongue is dry. | don’ t have any watchamacallit, any salvia left. Maybe if |
just have a little sip of your moose’ n’ banana shake. /Drinks from bottle]

It’ s really yummy...
