islands, indicating that there was some kind of psychic communication in
the air.

Now, how can this living New Age parable be applied to Auman
behavior? Well, whatever you do personally to help further the cause of
justice and the pursuit of ecstasy, even though you might get discouraged,
you must always remember that you might be the one who turns the
tide—you have to act as though you are the 100th monkey—and this
gives us reason to hope.

That’ s the good news.

The bad news is, those monkeys needed that dirt in their diet for
roughage. So now there were all these monkeys on this island who
weren’ t able to shit.

But it just so happened that this was one of the islands where we
shipped our surplus TV sets. Across the island, monkeys were gathered
around those TV sets, all watching a program that was sponsored by Ex-
Lax. Moreover, here was that commercial with the sign-language
translation. And, fortuitously enough, these monkeys had relatives trained
at Stanford University, where they learned how to communicate in sign
language, and had been returned to the island to teach others of their

species how to sign.
