an event like this,” she responds, without missing a bounce, “I' d say
eight to twelve hours.” She tells me that her circulation is excellent, and
that her 18-year-old son refers to the contraption as a “bungee
humper.” In addition to bouncing, it can also create “the illusion of
bondage, yet the person can actually be comfortable while restrained.”

The Auto Erotic Chair, however, provides rea/ bondage. It’ s
equipped with leather restraints and panic snaps for arms and legs, and
comes complete with a power box, pneumatically operated anal and
vaginal plugs. “Our power source unit is designed to stimulate nerve
fibers throughout the genital areas by delivering controllable electro-pulse
energy through conductive electrodes on our sex toys. Our precision-
engineered technology gives you safe and pleasurable electric play.” So,
for example, in the Electro-Flex Penile Ring/Anal Plug Configuration, “A
single conductor butt plug is used in conjunction with a single conductive
cock ring to complete the circuit. With a single conductive cock ring, one
side of a double conductive butt plug can be used to stimulate either the
prostate or the sphincter.”

If you’ d prefer something, well, less electric, there’ s always the
Crystal Wand, a 10-inch-long, S-shaped co-ed tool, hand-carved from pure

crystal-clear acrylic, that doubles simultaneously as a G-spot stimulator
