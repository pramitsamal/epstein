Dershowitz now requests that the Court modify the Confidentiality Order to allow
Dershowitz to use the transcript for those limited purposes as deemed necessary in the

present his defense.

I. DERSHOWITZ MUST BE ALLOWED TO CONTACT WITNESSES AND

ADVISE THEM OF WHAT ROBERTS ALLEGES IN ORDER TO VERIFY OR

INDIVIDUALS TO VERIFY ROBERTS’S ALLEGATIONS AND CREDIBILITY.

As explained by Plaintiffs Edwards and Cassell in their Response to Dershowitz’ s Motion
to Determine Confidentiality, the “sexual abuse allegations filed by Edwards and Cassell for

Edwards and Cassell for their client” go beyond Dershowitz. Another inherent part of this
lawsuit is what investigation, if any, Plaintiffs undertook with respect to the scope of Roberts’s
allegations, all of which bear upon her credibility. Dershowitz argues that Plaintiffs did not

Plaintiffs argue that they did. Dershowitz must be allowed to contact witnesses and advise them
of what Roberts alleges so that Dershowitz can not only verify or disprove her allegations and
credibility, but also determine whether Plaintiffs ever made efforts to contact key witnesses to
verify Roberts’s allegations and credibility. As explained by one Florida court, “[o]penness in
courts has a salutary effect on the propensity of witnesses to tell the truth” as it “informs persons
affected by litigation of its effect upon them... .” John Doe-1 Through John Doe-4 v. Museum
