Understanding 57

“The human mind tends to look
for clear linear relationships, we
like solutions that are close to the
problem in time and space and
make sense when we think about
it quickly, unfortunately, those
simple solutions are usually
wrong and come from acting on
a complex system as if it was a
simple one.”
