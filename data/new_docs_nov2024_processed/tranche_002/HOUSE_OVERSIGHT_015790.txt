X-rays

The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Wilhelm Rontgen in
1901. He had discovered ‘X’ rays; so called because he had no better
name for them. X-rays, as they became known, are just light of a very
high frequency.

Light comes in a variety of colors; at the low end of the frequency
scale we see red, higher up blue and, at the top, violet. At this point
human eyes give up and cannot see anything higher, so ultraviolet
light is invisible to us. Bees, on the other hand, can see a long way into
the ultraviolet spectrum and some flowers have beautiful ultraviolet
markings that attract bees for pollination. Daylight contains a great
deal of ultraviolet light which is wasted on us — other than to tan our
skin. But all is not lost. Clever manufacturers put fluorescent dyes
into their washing powders which stick to our clothes and convert
ultraviolet into visible light, making our T-shirts look brighter as they
reflect more visible light than fell on them. You can see this effect most
easily in a disco when ultraviolet lights are shone on the dance floor
and anyone wearing a newly washed T-shirt will glow bright white. The
other common substance that fluoresces strongly on a dance floor is
tonic water. Quinine, the active ingredient in tonic water, is a strongly
