Frogs Eyes are Very Sensitive

The processing power of the eye is staggering. The human retina has
about 120 million rods and 7 million cones, giving it an average resolution
of 10,000 by 10,000 pixels. Each rod is sensitive to individual photons
but we register light consciously only if we see around 5-7 photons. It
is thought frogs can react to single photons because of the chemistry of
their eyes and the fact they are cold-blooded, but this is not proven.

Some animals, including some frogs and my cat, have a tapetum
lucidum. This is a reflective backing to the eye that allows each photon
two chances to react with a rod, once on the way in and, if that fails,
once on the way out. This is why you can see the eyes of some animals if
you shine a light into the forest on a dark night. Cones are less sensitive
than rods but give us color perception. In the human eye, there are three
types of cone: a red, a green and a blue, giving us trichromatic vision.
We see colors because light stimulates more than one types of cell and
we infer the color in between. A fourth type of cone is present in some
species such as birds, reptiles, and fish. This gives them tetra-chromic
vision, allowing them to see into the ultraviolet range. It is speculated
some humans might have this ability but so far none has come forward.
Some animals lack the ability to see certain colors. Most dogs can't see
red, This gives cats a big advantage!

Many people wonder if we all see the same color as each other. Is
your red the same as mine? The brain’s perception of color is complex.
Although the color red is absolute and can be detected by a calibrated
sensor, our perception of color is relative. We perceive them in the context
