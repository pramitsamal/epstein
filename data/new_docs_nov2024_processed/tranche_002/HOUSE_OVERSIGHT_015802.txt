112 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

The resolution of the eye is not the same across the image. High
resolution is concentrated in the center, while lower resolution black
and white vision dominates the edge. This peripheral vision helps us
detect predators or play football but it is not the focus of our attention.
When we focus our attention on something, we turn our eyes to look at
it directly. The central part of our eye is called the fovea centralis and is
composed of cones. About half our cones are concentrated in this very
small section and this gives us immense visual acuity. For a computer
display to outperform this section of the eye it would need one billion by

one billion pixels. The fovea centralis is tiny, only two degrees across, so
our eyes must dart around the image to take in all the detail. Once the
basic information is encoded in our retina and sent down the optic nerve,
it goes into a production line process in the visual cortex where all the
elements are analyzed. Our brains extract information from the image
such as texture, edges and depth perception in specialized portions of
the brain. Because of this specialization it is possible to play tricks on the
brain with images that are not easy to process. Some we find pleasurable,
while others can be a little disturbing.
