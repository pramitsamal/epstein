124 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

Their reasoning is straightforward but has generated a great deal
of controversy. Hameroff observes that anesthetics cause humans to
lose consciousness by binding to tubulin, but they do not halt all brain
function. He, therefore, concludes our conscious thinking is mediated
by tubulin, not the larger scale firing of the neurons. Penrose had been
looking for a mechanism in the brain that would explain how brains
solve non-computational problems. Together Penrose and Hameroff
propose tubulin micro tubes are quantum gravity computers that allow
us to think non-computationally and are the seat of consciousness. The
ideas are still being worked.

Penrose and Hameroff have a difficult task conveying their ideas
to the rest of the scientific community. Scientists don’t recognize a
need for something that can think non-computably, so they are highly
skeptical of a mechanism which performs that sort of thought. The
latest development on the Hameroff Penrose model comes in the work
of Travis Craddock, now of Nova Southeastern University, Florida, and
others. They have written a paper arguing signals propagate according
to quantum principles within microtubules through the excitation
of thiamin molecules along the length of the tube. They believe these
molecules are quantum, entangled in a similar manner to the mechanism
recently discovered in photosynthesis. The geometry of these molecules
is set out in a similar way to the active areas in chlorophyll and they
have a complementary problems to solve. Chlorophyll tries to maximize
energy conversion efficiency, while a microtubule tries to minimize the
use of energy while propagating signals along a nerve. You might wonder
