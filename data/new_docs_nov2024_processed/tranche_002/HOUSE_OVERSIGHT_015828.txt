138 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

the English language was created in this poem. The same goes for much
of Shakespeare. If we used a filter method, we would have just deleted
most of Shakespeare from the English language! Indeed half the poems
in my anthology of English verse are destined for the waste paper basket
due to some minor infraction of ‘the rules. If you want something that
completely flummoxes my spelling checker here is the Loch Ness Monster
Song by Scottish poet Edwin Morgan. I asked a Scottish friend whether
Scottish spelling checkers fared any better and he assures me, no.
