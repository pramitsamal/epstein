Fields Medal

The equivalent of a Nobel Prize for mathematics is a Fields Medal.
Joseph Field provided the money and helped set up the prize. Today it
is administered as part of the International Mathematical Union. You
must be under 40 to receive the prize. Andrew Wiles was 45 when he
solved Fermat's Last Theorem, so they created a special prize for him
called a Fields Fellowship. Until recently only men had received the
prize. However in 2014 Maryam Mirzakhani won the prize for her work
on the geometry of Riemann surfaces.
