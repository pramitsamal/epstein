even if their names will not be disclosed, the Post respectfully submits that either the Manhattan
District Attorney or the Florida Prosecutors should provide notice promptly. To require the Post
to notify victims itself — without any ability to discover who those victims are — would be an
absurd result that defeats the purpose of the unsealing provision of section 50-b, which allows
“any person” to file an application requesting that information be unsealed for “good cause.”*

In sum, the strong presumption of openness that governs New York courts compels the
conclusion that the appellate briefs in this action must be unsealed (with the names of any
victims of a sexual offense redacted).

CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth above, the Post respectfully requests an order unsealing the
appellate briefs, which directs the District Attorney to provide counsel for the Post with copies of
these documents, with the names of victims redacted, within seven days of the issuance of this

Court’s unsealing order.

4 In its affidavit filed in opposition to the December 21 Motion, the Manhattan District Attomey indicated that “to
the extent that the Post is unable to furnish notice to the victims, this Office, which was not the prosecuting agency,
is not in a position to do so.” Browning Aff. Ex. E. The Post has mooted this objection by refiling its motion and
providing the Florida Prosecutors with notice of its intent to unseal the appeilate briefs with victims’ redacted.
