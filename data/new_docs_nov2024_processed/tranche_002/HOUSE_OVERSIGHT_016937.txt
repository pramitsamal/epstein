Alex “Sandy” Pentland, an exponent of what he has termed “social physics,” is
interested in building powerful human-Al ecologies. He is concerned at the same time
about the potential dangers of decision-making systems in which the data in effect take
over and human creativity is relegated to the background.

The advent of Big Data, he believes, has given us the opportunity to reinvent our
civilization: “We can now begin to actually look at the details of social interaction and
how those play out, and we re no longer limited to averages like market indices or
election results. This is an astounding change. The ability to see the details of the
market, of political revolutions, and to be able to predict and control them is definitely a
case of Promethean fire—it could be used for good or for ill. Big Data brings us to
interesting times.”

At our group meeting in Washington, Connecticut, he confessed that reading
Norbert Wiener on the concept of feedback “felt like reading my own thoughts.”

“After Wiener, people discovered or focused on the fact that there are genuinely
chaotic systems that are just not predictable,” he said, “but if you look at human
socioeconomic systems, there is a large percentage of variance you can account for and
predict. ... Today there is data from all sorts of digital devices, and from all of our
transactions. The fact that everything is datafied means you can measure things in real
time in most aspects of human life—and increasingly in every aspect of human life. The
fact that we have interesting computers and machine-learning techniques means that you
can build predictive models of human systems in ways you could never do before.”
