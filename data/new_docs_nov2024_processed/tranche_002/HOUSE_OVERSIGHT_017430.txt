While these premeditated and carefully organized killing sprees were taking place, the United
Nations fiddled on about the imperfections of the United States, Israel and other western
democracies. The real victims of this inversion have not been the western democracies that have
been the focus of the U.N. condemnations. The real victims have been those willfully ignored by
the U.N., which has used its focus on Israel and other democracies as an excuse—a cover—for its
malignant inaction against horrible human wrongs committed by the tyrannical regimes that
control much of the UN agenda and give themselves exculpatory immunity from any UN
condemnations or intervention. “Never again” has been turned into “again and again and again.”
The label of “human rights” has been used to promote human wrongs. Our heroes—Eleanor
Roosevelt, Rene Cassin, Albert Schweitzer—should be turning over in their graves, as the shields
they constructed to protect the helpless from oppression and genocide have been beaten into
swords to be used by the oppressors and genocidal killers.

I refuse to allow these human rights pretenders to hijack and invert the honorable agenda of
neutral and universal human rights. I will keep struggling until my dying day to return human
rights to its proper place in the international community.
