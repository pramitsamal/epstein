[#101] crimes or crimes against children. 74! In Indiana, the plain language of its statute leaves open the possibility of a
conferral right before formal charges to the extent that the statute includes two separate time frames: after a crime ... has been
charged or before any disposition of a criminal case involving the victim. 747
To be sure, not all states have afforded victims a voice throughout the entirety of the criminal justice process. 743 In some
states, the statutes are ambiguous. 74 In a handful of states, there is clear language limiting rights until after the filing of
charges. For example, Louisiana constrains the conferral right to criminal matters In which formal charges have been filed by
the district attorney's office. 745 Yet, unlike the federal CVRA, this statute specifically excludes pre-charging situations. And,
in any event, despite Louisiana's limitation on a particular right within the statute, the legislature in this state still often saw fit
to provide the victim with notification rights, even in the absence of the formal filing of charges. 74°
Very few state courts have ever considered the precise issue of whether conferral rights may attach prior to the formal filing of
charges. This is likely caused by the fact that, unlike the federal statute, many state statutes fail to provide the victim with a
procedural mechanism for challenging the conduct of prosecutors or law enforcement agencies. 74” However, in rare cases,
state courts have implicitly recognized that a meaningful interpretation of victims' rights should include some rights prior to
filing.

For example, a Connecticut court concluded that a company injured by the delinquent act of a minor was entitled to
information about the case [*102] contained in a police file in a civil proceeding, even though it appears that there was little
indication that criminal charges had been filed. 74% Similarly, the South Carolina Supreme Court, while limiting the ability of
the victim to challenge the conduct of a prosecutor, concluded that the same rights under the state constitution must attach prior
to the formal filing of an indictment. 74° Other courts have even permitted a victim to recover compensation or reparations for
unindicted or acquitted conduct. 7>°

41 Idaho Code Ann. § 19-5306(1)(f) (2004). As in the case of most of the state statutes, the Idaho statute is not without ambiguity. A
different provision within the statute makes the notification right contingent upon the filing of a criminal complaint or juvenile petition ... .

43 See, e.g., Md. Const. art. 47(b) (In a case originating by indictment or information filed in a circuit court, a victim of crime shall have the
right to be informed ... .).

44 In Delaware, for example, the statute contains an additional limitation in the conferral provision that is noticeably absent from the duty
imposed on law enforcement to provide information about the victim's rights to that victim. Compare De/. Code Ann. tit. 11, § 9405 (2007),
and Del. Code Ann. tit. 1], § 9411 (2007) (imposing additional requirements after the Attorney General commences the prosecution), with
Del. Code Ann. tit. 1], § 9410 (2007). Query whether the limitations imposed in one section should be inferred in the other under the doctrine
of expressio unius est exclusio alterius.
