U.S. conventional military capabilities, especially combined with
those of its likely allies, are of course far superior to those of Iran. In
many recent years the size of the U.S. defense supplemental alone
exceeded the entire Iranian defense budget. But a fight with Iran
would not be a fair or clean fight. Winning in any meaningful sense
might prove costly.

Escalation

If Iran’s advantage lies in broadening and widening a conflict once
begun, how might we expect its leaders to go about it? At least three
types of escalation are open to Tehran: horizontal, vertical and
domain.

Horizontal escalation involves the spread of hostilities from beyond
the immediate area of conflict to additional geographic areas and
political actors.13 Iran’s means and methods, as discussed above,
give it the ability to escalate horizontally within the Middle East
region and beyond to include Europe and the United States.

Vertical escalation involves the employment of new or increasingly
potent weapons systems, attacking new types of targets, or
introducing additional types of forces into the conflict.14 What
begins as essentially a fight between U.S. and allied air and naval
strike assets and Iranian air defense assets could be quickly expanded
by Iran to the use of offensive missile systems and naval surface and
sub-surface forces in retaliation. Iranian escalation to the employment
of WMD (if a war occurred after an Iranian breakout) seems unlikely
short of an imminent threat to the regime, but that threat would be
hanging in the air as fighting escalated.

Domain escalation refers to the expansion of the conflict from the
purely military domain to the diplomatic, economic and social
domains, in which Iran has some advantages.

In summary, an attack on Iran could produce dynamics that would
push either or both sides to escalate the conflict even if neither had an
