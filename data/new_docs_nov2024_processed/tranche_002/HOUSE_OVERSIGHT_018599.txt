organic and fair-trade as I could be, mostly because of expense, but I try to do it when I
can.

Kickass Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies

This is a modified version of a recipe that I originally found here, and some of the text
comes from that recipe.

+ 1 and 1/2 cups of FLOUR

+ | teaspoon BAKING SODA

+ 1 teaspoon SALT

+ 3/4 cup of OIL

+ 2 tablespoons COCONUT MILK (or ALMOND MILK or SOY MILK)
+ 1 & 1/3 cups of UNREFINED SUGAR

+ HALF A BANANA

+ 1 1/2 tablespoons VANILLA EXTRACT (I've occasionally used RUM as a
replacement; when I do that, I like to add some CINNAMON)

+ 2 1/2 cups OATMEAL
+ 12 oz. of DARK CHOCOLATE CHIPS

Heat your oven to 350 degrees.
Mix FLOUR, BAKING SODA and SALT together. Set aside.

Mix together the OIL and SUGAR. Mix until creamy. Thoroughly mash the BANANA
into the mixture.

Add the COCONUT MILK.

Add the VANILLA.

Stir this mixture until it is a uniform color (this will not take long).
Slowly stir in the FLOUR mixture. Mix this well.

Stir in OATMEAL and CHOCOLATE-CHIPS.

Preheat oven to baking temperature (usually 350 F).

Place large tablespoons full of the batter onto an ungreased cookie sheet (an air filled
cookie sheet works best, as the air between the two layers of the sheet keeps the bottom
of baked items from burning).

Bake the cookies for about 9 to 13 minutes (ovens vary in temperature). Check them by
gently pressing on the top of one of the cookies. If the inside looks moist, but not too wet,
they are probably done. It might take you a couple of tries to get the time down, so bake
only a few at a time when starting out. Do not, I repeat, do not expect to see them turn
