BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

common ideologies, whether faith in Marxist revolution
or ultraconservative, anticommunist reaction.

As the 20th century drew to a close, the weaknesses
of both communist systems and traditional dictator-
ships became increasingly apparent. Front and center
was the growing economic gap between countries
that had opted for market economies and regimes
that were committed to statist economies.

The political and economic barriers that had long shel-
tered the old dictatorships were soon swept away, and
those that survived or recovered did so by making a

series of strategic concessions to the new global order.

odern authoritarianism has a different set of defin-

ing features:

¢ Anillusion of pluralism that masks state control
over key political institutions, with co-opted or
otherwise defanged opposition parties allowed
to participate in regular elections

¢ State or oligarchic control over key elements of
the national economy, which is otherwise open
to the global economy and private investment,
to ensure loyalty to the regime and bolster
regime claims of legitimacy based on economic
prosperity

¢ State or oligarchic control over information on
certain political subjects and key sectors of the
media, which are otherwise pluralistic, with high
production values and entertaining content; in-
dependent outlets survive with small audiences
and little influence

¢ Suppression of nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) that are focused on human rights or
political reform, but state tolerance or support
for progovernment or apolitical groups that work
on public health, education, and other develop-
ment issues

¢ Legalized political repression, with targets pun-
ished through vaguely worded laws and political-
ly obedient courts

¢ Limited, selective, and typically hidden use of
extralegal force or violence, with a concentration
on political dissidents, critical journalists, and
officials who have fallen from favor

¢ Opportunistic, non-ideological cooperation with

fellow authoritarian states against pressure
for democratic reform or leadership changes,
international human rights norms and mech-
anisms, and international security or justice
interventions

¢ Knowledge-sharing with or emulation of fellow
authoritarian states regarding tactics and legis-
lation to enhance domestic control

China and Russia
The two major modern authoritarian powers are China
and Russia.

Until fairly recently, the conventional wisdom was that
China's one-party authoritarian system would gradual-
ly relax as the middle class expanded and the country
became fully integrated into the global economic

and diplomatic systems. The leadership did expand
citizens’ freedom to travel, make money, and access
information and entertainment that did not touch on
sensitive subjects. But it has resolutely refused to give
up control over the political sphere.

In fact, the state has become increasingly aggressive
in its suppression of political dissent and information
that might challenge the Communist Party narrative.
The regime's rhetoric and policies have become more
hostile to democracy and “Western” values. Its propa-
ganda asserts the superior efficiency of the one-party
system and sneers at the messiness of democracy.
And the focus of its repressive apparatus has steadily
expanded from a relatively narrow segment of political
opposition figures to encompass a broad collection of
target groups, including human rights lawyers, ethnic
minorities, Christians, women’s rights advocates, liber-
al academics, and independent journalists.

Russia is much smaller than China in terms of pop-
ulation and economic might, but it has emerged as
a leader of modern authoritarian innovation. Under
Vladimir Putin, the Russian regime pioneered the
capture of the media through state enterprises and
oligarchic cronies, the adoption of laws designed to
dismember civil society, the use of the judiciary as
an instrument of political harassment, and, perhaps
most importantly of all, the development of modern
propaganda and disinformation.

Russia has also been in the vanguard of a relentless
campaign against liberal values, and has moved
relentlessly to export authoritarian ideas and tech-
niques to other societies, both in neighboring
