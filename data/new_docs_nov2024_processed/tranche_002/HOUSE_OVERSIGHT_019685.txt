CHAPTER 19
The Rise of the NSA

There are many things we do in intelligence that, if revealed,
would have the potential for all kinds of blowback.

—JAMES CLAPPER, director of national intelligence, 2013

[ THE GAME OF NATIONS, which often is not visible to public
scrutiny, the great prize is state secrets that reveal the hidden
weaknesses of a nation’s potential adversaries. The most impor-
tant of these in peacetime is communication intercepts. It was just
such state secrets that Edward Snowden took from the NSA in the
spring of 2013. Before that breach, America’s paramount advantage
in this subterranean competition was its undisputed dominance in
the business of obtaining and deciphering the communications of
other nations. The NSA was the instrument by which the United
States both protected its own secret communications and stole the
secrets of foreign nations. The NSA, however, has an Achilles’s heel:
It is dependent on civilian computer technicians who do not neces-
sarily share its values to operate its complex system. Because of this
dependence, it was not able in 2013, as it turned out, to protect its
crucial sources and methods.

the aforementioned descriptions of the gaps in America’s coverage
