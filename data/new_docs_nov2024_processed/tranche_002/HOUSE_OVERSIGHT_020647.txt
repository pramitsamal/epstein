PRC-Funded and PRC-Controlled Media Outlets

The Chinese Communist Party liaises with Chinese-language media mainly through
the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council (or Qiao Ban {*7). The Qiao
Ban holds an annual conference on Chinese-language media called the World Chinese
Media Forum. These media outlets are registered in the United States by US citizens
or permanent residents, but they might actually be owned by Chinese state-run

companies.

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council of PRC (FRR #REBHAS)
appears to directly control the Asian Culture and Media Group (HS: WicikheR SB)
in America, which has three media subsidiaries: SinoVision (ZH #}X##), the China
Press (Qiaobao or #4), and the Sino American Times (iN). Sky Link TV (KF)
is another media outlet in the United States. Unlike SinoVision and Qiaobao, it is fully
owned by Guangzhou Media American Co, Ltd. (2B Bi AiR a]), which in turn

is owned by GZ Television Media (J N32 SRA al), a Chinese state-owned media

outlet.

SinoVision

The group’s main TV outlet is SinoVision. It operates two twenty-four-hour channels
(one Chinese and one English), and it is on the program lineups of cable systems Time
Warner Cable-73, Verizon FiOS-26, Cablevision-73, and RCN-80, covering about thirty

million people. Sinovision’s website (RE F384, http://www.sinovision.net) ranks
