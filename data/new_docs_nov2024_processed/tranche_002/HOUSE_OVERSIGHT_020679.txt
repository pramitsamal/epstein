The photograph, taken by Horace Cort, shows Jimmy Brock, manager of the Monson Motor Lodge motel pouring a bottle
of muriatic acid into the pool to scare protesters swimming in the pool. Martin Luther King Jr was arrested for

trespassing at the same motel seven days prior and the protesters planned a swim-in in the motel’s pool.
