What might seem like an ordinary picture at first, shows a fire breaking out aboard the ship called SS Grandcamp. The
people on the dock are members of the Texas City Volunteer Fire Department, attempting to extinguish the fire. Just
moments after the picture was taken, the ship exploded and caused what is still known as the largest non-nuclear

explosion in human history. Over 5,000 people were injured and 468 died in this 1947 tragedy.
