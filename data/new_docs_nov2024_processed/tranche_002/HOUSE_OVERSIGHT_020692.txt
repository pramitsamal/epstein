After post-war Berlin was divided into four occupation zones, the living conditions were greatly different in each one.
Between 1949 and 1961, about 2.5 million people fled from Soviet-occupied East Germany. Barricades and barb wire was
placed to stop people from fleeing but that did not stop 19-year-old border guard Hans Conrad Schumann. A crown in
