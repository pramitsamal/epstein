Highlights from F2010 USA Inc. Financials

e Summary — USA Inc. has challenges.

e Cash Flow — While recession depressed F2008-F2010 results, cash flow has been negative
for 9 consecutive years ($4.8 trillion, cumulative), with no end to losses in sight. Negative
cash flow implies that USA Inc. can't afford the services it is providing to 'customers,’ many
of whom are people with few alternatives.

e Balance Sheet — Net worth is negative and deteriorating.

e Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities — Off-balance sheet liabilities of at least $31 trillion (primarily
unfunded Medicare and Social Security obligations) amount to nearly $3 for every $1 of debt
on the books. Just as unfunded corporate pensions and other post-employment benefits
(OPEB) weigh on public corporations, unfunded entitlements, over time, may increase USA
Inc.’s cost of capital. And today’s off-balance sheet liabilities will be tomorrow’s on-balance
sheet debt.

e Conclusion — Publicly traded companies with similar financial trends would be pressed by
shareholders to pursue a turnaround. The good news: USA Inc.’s underlying asset base and
entrepreneurial culture are strong. The financial trends can shift toward a positive direction,
but both ‘management’ and ‘shareholders’ will need collective focus, willpower, commitment,
and sacrifice.

Note: USA federal fiscal year ends in September, Cash flow = total revenue — total spending on a cash basis; net worth includes

unfunded future liabilities from Social Security and Medicare on an accrual basis over the next 75 years. Source: cash flow per

White House Office of Management and Budget; net worth per Dept. of Treasury, “2010 Financial Report of the U.S.

KP Government,” adjusted to include unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare.
