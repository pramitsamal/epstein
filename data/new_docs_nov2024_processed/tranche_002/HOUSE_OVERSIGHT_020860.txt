How Did USA Inc.'s Financial Reality

Get to this Difficult Point?

USA Inc. Has Not Adequately Funded Its Entitlement Programs

Recessions come and go (and affect USA’s revenue), but future claims
(related to entitlement program commitments) on USA Inc. now
meaningfully exceed its projected cash flows.

For the last 40 years, management (the government) has committed
more long-term benefits through ‘entitlement’ programs like Medicaid /
Medicare / Social Security...without developing a sound plan to pay for
them.

Many of these programs provide important services to low-income,
unemployed, and disabled Americans in great need for help. But without
proper financing, support may dwindle.

USA Inc. Has Substantially Expanded

lts “Business Lines” Over Past 80 Years

From 1789 to 1930, 41%!‘ of USA Inc.’s cumulative
budget was dedicated to defense spending (compared
with 20%! in F2010), per the Census Bureau.

This began to change in the 1930s, when the federal
government substantially expanded its role (in effect,
expanded its “business lines”) in response to the Great
Depression.

Note: 1) 41% is the cumulative defense spending (excluding veterans’ benefits and services) as % of cumulative total federal
spending from 1789 to 1930. including veterans’ benefits and services, defense spending would have been 49% of cumulative
annual budget from 1789 to 1930 and would have been 22% in F2009. Source: Census Bureau, “Historical Statistics of the
United States, Colonial Times to 1970,” Data series ¥Y 457-465.
