Medicaid: Facing Accelerating Cash Flow Deficits

e Social Welfare Program — Created in 1965 to provide health insurance to low-income
population (2% of Americans under coverage then and 16% now’).

e No Dedicated Funding — Federal funding comes from general revenue (all forms of tax
receipts).

e Ever-Growing Expenses — $273 billion in F2010, up 2x from 10 years ago.

e Rising Healthcare Costs — Owing to aging population + unhealthy life styles +
technology advances.

e Growing Beneficiary + Benefits — Covered beneficiaries expanded beyond low-
income group in 1980s to include additional groups (like individuals who have high
medical expenses and have spent down their assets, and some of those who lost
their employer-sponsored healthcare insurance coverage in recession), while
covered benefits expanded to include prescription drugs / dental services. Total
expenditures on these new groups and benefits represented ~60% of Medicaid
program’s spending in 2001, per Kaiser Family Foundation estimates. See
slide 319-322 for more details.

e Moral Hazard — As a “free good,” Medicaid reduced demand for private long-term
insurance’ while regulation loopholes + need-based benefit policies created
incentives to abuse the Medicaid reimbursement system.
