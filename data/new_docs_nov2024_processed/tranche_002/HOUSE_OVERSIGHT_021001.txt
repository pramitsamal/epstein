condition of participating in Medicaid, states are required to cover certain “mandatory” populations and to provide a specified set of benefits. States also have

discretion to cover additional low-income individuals in each of these categories (“optional groups’) and receive federal matching payments. Optional eligibility

categories include children and parents, persons with disabilities and the elderly above mandatory coverage limits; persons residing in nursing facilities; and the
