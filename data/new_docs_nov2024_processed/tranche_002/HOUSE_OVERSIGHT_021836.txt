Q. -- so let me finish --

A. Sure. I just want to make sure you get an
opportunity to ask as many questions as you want so.

Q. Okay. And I appreciate that, but the court
reporter can't take down both of us at once. So we just
need to speak one at a time, but I appreciate that.

A. Good.

Q. I believe the last question I was asking you
about whether the scope of the investigation, what
reasonably required of an attorney varies depending upon
the nature of the allegations being made. I think you
said, yes; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And could you explain how, what in your
understanding of how --

A. Sure. I mean, obviously, they are going to
be some cases that are very complicated factually. More
investigation would be appropriate there. There can be
some situations that very simple factually, less
investigation would be factually necessary there. Same
points about legal issues, too, some cases are complex
legally, some cases are simple legally.

The more legal investigation would be
required for the more complex cases.
