her will while acting as though he was evaluating her body. Alicia
had stopped Epstein, and left the room, but couldn't get over the

At the top of his crime report, the officer wrote “Sexual

Santa Monica Police Department discounted every one of [Alicia’s]

no action on this 1997 complaint,” Epstein’s West Palm Beach
attorney, Jack Goldberger, told the Palm Beach Post in 2010.

“The cops said it'd be my word against his,” Alicia told the
paper. “And since he had a lot of money, I let it go. I hadn't
thought much about it since, until I saw his picture online. And
now, I want everybody to know how much of a creep he’s always
been.”
