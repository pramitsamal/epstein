Jeffrey Epstein: February 2, 2011

t's Groundhog Day, and once-reclusive Jeffrey Epstein is hit-
ting the peak of his fame in a ripped-from-the-headlines epi-
sode of Law & Order: SVU that tracks, eerily well, with his
| own legal history.

The setup for this episode is the rape of a very young French
1 girl. One who's been flown to New York on a very rich man’s pri-
4 vate jet, then flown back—coach class —to Paris.

_ Onthe plane, she has a freak-out. She thinks the middle-aged
guy sitting next to her is trying to rape her. In Paris, the local
“police get involved.

__ ‘It was just a birthday party,” the tearful girl tells the SVU
¢ Ops via videoconference from France. “We were his present.”

q The cops ask: Whose present?

_ “The billionaire. The one who owns the jet.”

_ Does the French girl know his name?
