Although he has spent more than a year in jail and paid out what may
be as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have gotten away with
it—that worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute
badness: the financier whose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather
than work; a rich middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and
entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent Playboy in a
correct and prudish world; someone who somehow didn’t get the memo
about vast changes in mores and culture.

When I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus is
to get married, he said he would rather go back to jail.

He is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.

This is all, inevitably, a Gatsby-like story. But Gatsby in New York
Post and Daily Mail parlance would likely be a freaky financier too.

And it’s a story about the limitation of journalism, in which the most
compelling parts of the story—it would take a long running cable show to do
justice to the meaning of Epstein’s ambitions and impulses—need to be
sacrificed for not just moral certainty but for a rather preposterous fantasy of
moral certainty.

Anyway, I hope I get invited back to Jeffrey’s house.
