No alpha from repatriation and multiples actually compressed

Our analysis of the top 15 repatriating companies (from Table 7) suggests that while
these companies initially outperformed both the S&P 500 and equal-weighted S&P 500
from November 2004-April 2005 (by 6ppt and 5ppt, respectively), they subsequently
underperformed during the remainder of 2005 and early 2006 (Chart 6). From the end of
September 2004 through year-end 2006, these stocks were up 27% on average, in-line
with the overall S&P 500, and below the equal-weighted benchmark’s 36% return. And
multiples for these stocks compressed over the majority of this period, both on an
absolute basis and relative to the benchmark (Chart 7).

Post-repatriation cash use: will this time be different?

Valuations, Investor preference, growth & leverage ratios suggest less buybacks
While any potential restrictions on the use of repatriated earnings are still unknown, we
suspect that a pick-up in buybacks is likely, but that a lower proportion will be used for
buybacks today than during the last repatriation holiday. Valuations were generally more
attractive in 2004-2005 on most metrics (Table 9), and we’ve found that buybacks tend
to be more rewarded when stocks are cheap (Chart 8). Additionally, the largest buybacks
have not generated alpha for the last several years, as investors have increasingly
agitated for companies to use their excess cash on pro-growth investments (namely
capex.) According to BofAML’s latest Global Fund Manager Survey, 60% of investors
want companies to increase capex spending, vs. 17% who want companies to return
cash to shareholders (Exhibit 1). This compares to a majority of investors desiring
companies to return cash to shareholders when the HIA was passed in late 2004.

Companies may also feel less pressure to bolster per share metrics by reducing share
count if top line is recovering and organic growth is finally materializing. And from a
capital structure perspective, if leverage loses its tax benefit, given that leverage ratios
are already high (see below) companies may be less likely to reduce their equity capital
base, as that would marginally increase their weighted average cost of capital.

Special dividends, pay-down of debt may be other likely uses

Companies may also return the cash to shareholders by issuing a one-time special
dividend: income remains in-demand, given that both interest rates and dividend payout
ratios remain historically low. And if a repatriation tax holiday comes within the context
of broader tax reform that includes an end to the deductibility of interest expense,
companies may choose to pay down debt over other uses of cash, in an attempt to skew
their balance sheets less toward debt and more toward equity (see the section on no
