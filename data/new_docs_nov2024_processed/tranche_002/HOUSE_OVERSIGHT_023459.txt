But comparison to the short-lived flowering of protests 40 years ago
in Czechoslovakia is turning out to be apt in another way. For all the
attention the Mideast protests have received, their most notable
impact on the region thus far hasn't been an upswell of democracy. It
has been a dramatic spike in tensions between two geopolitical titans,
Iran and Saudi Arabia.

This new Middle East cold war comes complete with its own spy-
versus-spy intrigues, disinformation campaigns, shadowy proxy
forces, supercharged state rhetoric—and very high stakes.

showdown has been two of the liveliest democracy movements in
countries right on the fault line, Bahrain and the turbulent frontier
state of Yemen. But many worry that the toll could wind up much
