existing nuclear states to advance toward that goal, will do more to
spread than contain nuclear weapons—directly, by encouraging some
current non-nuclear states to consider developing nuclear weapons,
and indirectly, by displacing and undermining other more effective
strategies. At the heart of the case for global zero is an argument—
that reductions (on the way to zero) in our nuclear force will lead
others to reduce theirs or curtail or abandon plans to acquire them
altogether—that ignores history, logic, and politics.

One important reason why most friends and allies of the United
States (Britain and France being the exceptions) have not sought
nuclear weapons of their own has been our readiness to extend the
protection of our nuclear deterrent to cover them. Germany, Japan,
and South Korea, all quite capable of building nuclear weapons, went
through even the precarious periods of the Cold War confident that
our nuclear force made it unnecessary for them to have nuclear forces
of their own. Where the United States was unwilling or unable to
offer protection to countries that believed themselves threatened—
India and Pakistan, for example—those countries did build
independent nuclear capabilities. If the United States is seen to be
heading toward eliminating its nuclear capabilities, countries that
have relied on us may decide that they must acquire their own nuclear
weapons. This is especially true in a region where another state, like
Iran, is pursuing nuclear weapons and is likely to obtain them, thus
alarming and frightening its neighbors into an arms race they would
rather avoid. The sad history of the nuclearization of the Indian
subcontinent, for instance, appears to have begun with India
responding to China’s nuclearization, followed by Pakistan
responding to India’s. If the United States is seen to be on a path to
relinquishing nuclear weapons, is it reasonable to expect the Japanese
and the South Koreans, long sheltered by our deterrent, to remain
indifferent to the nuclear forces of China and North Korea?
