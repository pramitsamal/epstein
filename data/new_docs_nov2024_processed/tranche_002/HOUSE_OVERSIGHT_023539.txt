An Old Man’s Thoughts on War and

Peace
Edward Bernard Glick

May-June 2011 -- WHEN I WAS a young man in graduate school,
two books impressed me mightily. They still do. One is Konrad
Lorenz’s On Aggression. An M.D. and a Ph.D. and a 1973 Nobel
laureate in medicine and physiology, Lorenz established the field of
ethology, the study of the behavior of animals within their natural
environment. In his prologue to On Aggression, Lorenz wrote, “The
subject of this book is aggression, that is to say the fighting instinct in
beast and man, which is directed against members of the same
species.” According to him, animals, particularly males, are
biologically programmed to fight over resources and turf, and this
behavior is part of natural selection. In short, to a great degree,
ageressive behavior is innate.

The other book that influenced me mightily as a young man was
Robert Ardrey’s The Territorial Imperative. Ardrey popularized and
expanded on Lorenz’s ideas. After reading Ardrey, a Book-of-the-
Month Club reviewer asked, “Are we a territorial species? Do we
defend ourselves, whether by war or other means, because we have
learned to do so—or because, as animals, we must?”

Reading Lorenz and Ardrey provides a good reason for believing the
Roman proverb Si vis pacem para bellum, “He who wishes peace
should prepare for war.” (The full text of the proverb goes on to say,
“He who desires victory should carefully train his soldiers; he who
wants favorable results should fight relying on skill, not chance.”)
