VII. ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH SPROUT FUNDS

Since 2005, the Fund Managers have managed the remaining portfolio of healthcare technology
investments in Sprout Capital VI, L.P., Sprout Capital VII, L.P., and Sprout Capital IX, L.P.
under a Sub-Management Agreement between Credit Suisse and New Leaf Venture Partners,
L.L.C. (the “Management Company”). In return for these management services, the
Management Company had received a portion of the management fee collected by those Sprout
funds related to the healthcare portfolio.

At the present time, Sprout Capital IX, L.P. is the only fund with any remaining active
healthcare technology investments. There were six active health care technology companies
(three board seats) in the Sprout Capital IX, L.P. portfolio that are managed by the Fund
Managers, which represented $68 million of carrying value as of March 31, 2014. These
remaining investments are in mature companies and the Fund Managers intend to continue to
manage the investments with an emphasis on finding exit opportunities for each company at an
appropriate time. The Fund Managers have already exited a portion of these companies in
early 2014, leaving a very limited tail of Sprout investments and board seats.

The Fund Managers expect the arrangement with Credit Suisse to continue for the foreseeable
future, but the Management Company no longer receives any management fees for these
services. The Sub-Management Agreement between Credit Suisse and the Management
Company will wind down and eventually be terminated as the investments in the Sprout
Capital IX, L.P. portfolio are exited.
