Day 8: Governance

The tensions between free vs. proprietary software help focus us on foundational questions of
governance that are threaded through the course. To what extent should new technologies be
shaped and shared by anyone without gatekeeping? 2017 may find the Internet in middle age.
Do its puzzles suggest anything about whether and how to resolve governance questions for
more newly mainstreamed technologies like machine learning and other Al?

In addition to the challenges that the Internet has provided in regulation and governance, the
inability to really understand what many “learned” algorithms do, and their ability to have
properties and abilities beyond the capabilities of their initial designers, presents additional
challenges when thinking about whether and how to regulate the research, as well as the
deployment, of Al. Phenomena like digital currencies and distributed Al systems reprises the
ideas and challenges of Barlow’s declaration of independence of cyberspace.
