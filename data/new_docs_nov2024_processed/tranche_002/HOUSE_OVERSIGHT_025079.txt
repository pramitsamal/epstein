What, of that $1 billion investment, was

were providing cement powder and sand,
she said, and the project had consulted with
Israeli experts. In some cases, you have

The fake street, fake valley, fake
apartment-display ended in a pleasant sky-
lit lobby, where representatives of the
Cairo Amman Bank, Arab Islamic Bank,
and Arab Bank sat in logoed glass cubicles,
available to discuss financing for future

city appears in its completed glory -- a
place where families picnic, men in
business dress greet each other amid
bustling plazas, and fireworks crest over
soaring apartment towers topped with solar
panels. The architecture is tasteful. These
aren't dachas plunked on fake islands off
the coast of Dubai. It's the kind of place
where I, or just about anyone in the world
with middle or even upper-middle class
aspirations, would want to live. And it
looked weirdly familiar.
