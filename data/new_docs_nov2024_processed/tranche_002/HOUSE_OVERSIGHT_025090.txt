Danin believes that Rawabi's Palestinian
and Qatari investors made a wise decision.
Housing in Ramallah is expensive, and
Danin says that there is a sizable and
highly-educated Palestinian middle class in
need of an alternative to the West Bank's
de-facto capital. He expressed little doubt
when I asked him if the West Bank
economy could support Rawabi. This is a
Palestinian national project, he said. It is
the best of what is possible in that it's
private sector-led, and it's profit-making
led.

And it has supporters in high places. When
President Barack Obama met with Israeli
officials in Washington in September of
2010, Rawabi was on the agenda.

From one perspective, Rawabi is a historic
investment in Palestine, as well as an
unusually open point of cooperation
between Israel and an Arab government. It
could improve the lives of Palestinians,
while convincing Israelis that they have
nothing to fear from their neighbors'
prosperity. But any attempts to change

the status quo in the West Bank are fraught
with difficulties.

There's Israeli bureaucracy to overcome.
In Israel, if the Minister of Defense says I
want something, it's not that the system
thwarts it. But the system is so
decentralized that ultimately it takes a lot
of steps to get it translated into action,
