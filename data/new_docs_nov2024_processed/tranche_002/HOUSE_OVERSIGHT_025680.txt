 Traditional payment processors, Visa and Mastercard, each processed several trillion worth of transaction volumes in
2016. Bitcoin has processed $111 billion of transactions over the last 12 months.

—  Bitcoin’s slow transaction time precipitated its recent “hard fork” in attempt to enhance processing capacity.

= Whereas traditional payment processors’ market cap represents ~3% of their transaction volume, Bitcoin’s represents
97%, suggesting its valuation is dislocated from its fundamental value and that speculation has driven its price.
