LOOKING AHEAD

In its fifth year, OGIS will continue to offer mediation services to
requesters and agencies; review agencies’ FOIA policies, procedures,
and compliance; and identify additional areas for improvement in the
FOIA process through recommendations to Congress and the President.
OGIS will also work to implement GAO’s recommendations of creating
performance measures and goals for its mediation services, as well as to

build on its review program.
