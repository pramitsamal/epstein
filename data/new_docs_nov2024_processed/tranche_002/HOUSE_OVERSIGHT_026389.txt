21. At the appropriate time in this litigation, Plaintiff shall amend her complaint to
assert a claim for punitive damages against Defendants in order to punish Defendants for their

actions and to deter Defendants from repeating their conduct.

TOLLING OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

22. Any statute of limitations applicable to rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual
acts, sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless infliction of
emotional distress, false imprisonment of a minor, if any, is tolled owing to the continuous and
active duress imposed upon Plaintiff by Defendants that effectively robbed Plaintiff of her free
will to commence legal action until the present time. Cullen v. Margiotta, 811 F.2d 698, 722
(2nd Cir.1987); Ross v. United States, 574 F. Supp. 536, 542 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). More
particularly, Plaintiff was unrelentingly threatened by each Defendant that, were she ever to
reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to her by Defendants, Plaintiff
and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. The duress has not terminated and the
fear has not subsided. The duress is an element of or inherent in the underlying causes of action
complained of herein. The duress and coercion exerted by Defendants has been such as to have

such a level that a person of reasonable firmness in Plaintiff's situation would have been unable
to resist. Exhs. A and B.

and indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed,
Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear

like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with
