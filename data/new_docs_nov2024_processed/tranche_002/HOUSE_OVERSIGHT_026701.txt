Home market investment allows for greater
internalisation and reduced hedging costs

Given recent increases in the likelinood of outflows,
figure 13 shows how sovereigns are growing their
focus on home market allocations to reduce foreign
currency exposure. While home market investment
aligns to greater internalisation, it also grows
correlations between sovereign portfolio performance
and local economic performance. Since sovereign
funding is also heavily dependent on the local market,
sovereigns are at risk of increasing cashflow strains
(from both investment returns and new funding) when
the local economy underperforms.

Sovereigns may need to revert to greater
geographic diversification, at the cost of short-
term returns

The combination of continuing home market tilts,
along with a concentration in a small number of ‘safe
havens’, threatens to squeeze allocations to markets
that lack clear growth or stability attributes. As the
granularity of geopolitical risk models increases,
sovereigns are at risk of being overly selective in their
geographic investments and becoming dependent
on single markets within geographic regions.

However, many of the driving forces behind
concentrated geographic allocations are unlikely
to last. Interest rate disparity in developed markets
is expected to reduce if European and Japanese
quantitative tightening begins, suggesting that
increased fixed income allocations to the US are
tactical. Similarly, while growing emerging market
allocations is a strategic initiative, India has been
targeted due to its recent economic growth, relative
to other major emerging markets.

While sovereigns are willing to be overweight
individual countries to capture additional returns
(either through short-term tactical allocations or
greater internalisation), they may shift their focus
back to managing risk across diverse geographic
allocations, fulfilling their aim to make government
reserves independent of local economic performance.
