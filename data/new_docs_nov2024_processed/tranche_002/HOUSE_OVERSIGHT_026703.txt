OF COUNSEL
THOMAS E. McHUGH

Mr. John Roth

Senior Associate Deputy Attorney General
Office of the Deputy Attorney General
United States Department of Justice

950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. Roth:

I write to offer my reaction to the May 15, 2008 correspondence from the United States
Department of Justice Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (“CEOS”) regarding the federal
investigation of Jeffrey Epstein by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of

Florida (“(USAO”).’ I will refrain from recounting Mr. Epstein’s arguments in detail here, but,
rather, will highlight salient points responsive to the CEOS letter.

In particular, I write from a background well familiar with child exploitation cases and
victim/witness issues. As the CEOS letter points out (CEOS letter at p. 3), I was a member of
CEOS. In fact, I served as a federal prosecutor for twelve years; five years as an Assistant United
States Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, and seven years at CEOS. I began
working as a trial attorney for CEOS in 1999, and was promoted to Deputy Chief for Litigation in
2002, and ultimately to Principal Deputy Chief for the Section in 2004,

As those who have worked with me know, [have a history of working diligently on behalf of
victims of crime. While at the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West
Virginia, I was a part of the prosecution team that prosecuted the first case in the country under the
federal Violence Against Women Act. United States v. Bailey, 112 F.3d 758 (4 Cir.), cert denied,
522 U.S. 896 (1997). The case went to trial and the defendant was sentenced to life in prison. I also
spearheaded the domestic violence and federal criminal child support prosecution efforts for that
office, prosecuting some of the first cases in the country under the federal Child Support Recovery

1 Citations to the May 15, 2008 correspondence will be referenced herein as “CEOS letter at p. __.”
