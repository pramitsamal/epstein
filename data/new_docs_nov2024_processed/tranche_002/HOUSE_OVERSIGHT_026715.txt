Leading adopters are embedding governance-based
engagement, with an expectation of improved long-
term returns
While non-adopters wait on the evidence of ESG
investment outcomes, leading adopters are moving
further down the path of integrating ESG principles
into investment allocation and management
decisions, including through active engagement with
or participation in investee company decision-making.
Larger sovereigns with internal asset management
capability were most confident in their ability to
execute their ESG strategies, due to their higher levels
of engagement with their investments (figure 25).
These larger sovereigns noted that direct engagement
benefits substantially outweighed the cost of external
advisers and representation; notably
- The largest sovereigns drew a clear line from long-
term investor influence on corporate structure
and executive remuneration to ‘active’ investment
performance through the cycle
- Sovereigns felt able to better represent the interest
of government or non-government stakeholders
through direct engagement
- Finally, for sovereigns committed to ESG, direct
governance engagement provided a mechanism
to proactively drive an ESG agenda in future
investment and management decision-making

Future uptake of ESG integration requires more
performance data, while growth in active ownership
requires third-party assistance

The adoption of negative screens is encouraging

for ESG advocates; however, the majority of current

non-adopters are unwilling to move further in the

absence of strong objective evidence of positive
investment risk/return outcomes from ESG investing
relative to cost. ESG adopters overwhelmingly
observe a positive differential in long-term returns

(with 70% of respondents perceiving an increase

in returns from ESG as seen in figure 26), and

many adopters explained that they were seeking to

integrate systematic ESG risk measurement into the

investment process. However, ESG user and non-user
respondents acknowledge that there is a need for
robust data on integrated ESG strategies, which can
only be addressed through continued measurement
of the impact on performance.

Despite uncertainties around the impact of ESG
integration, there is a growing consensus among all
respondents on the positive effect of governance
on investment returns. However, there are many
challenges to developing and managing an active
ownership strategy:

- Many sovereigns have not defined their governance
principles and were wary of demanding levels of
transparency from their investees that the sovereign
fund itself did not provide

- The adoption of active ownership requires hiring
subject matter experts, and many investment
sovereign respondents were intent on using
recruitment budget to expand internal investment
teams

- Certain sovereigns did not hold shareholder voting
rights across the majority of their securities and
were wary of the costs involved in switching these
investments for those with voting rights

- Many respondents stated that they were challenged
by lack of engagement from consultants and asset
managers

While smaller sovereigns have been dissuaded from

investment engagement by these cost restraints,

evidence of benefits in returns and representation

of sovereign interests will be key in driving greater

uptake of sovereign active ownership. With some

sovereigns looking internally to invest, based on the
ability to embed government-based engagement,
asset managers must respond by offering sovereigns
the opportunity participate in the stewardship of
companies by means of voting rights.
