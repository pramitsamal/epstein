HOST: Robert Lawrence Kuhn
joining us via skype from Beijing.
He's the author of How China's
Leaders Think and a longtime
advisor to Chinese leaders and
corporations. Robert, we appreciate
you joining us. First off, you know it
seems like Trump's strategy here is
to force China into concessions with
these tariffs. What's China's view
on that?

RLK: China's view is that the
economic ties between China and
the rest of the world, the United
States in particular, is very
important for the peace and
prosperity of the world.
