the Washington Post reported: “The P5+1
powers have made only mild revisions to
a proposal that Iran flatly rejected last
June.” Until now, the United States has
been unwilling to acknowledge Iran’s
right to enrich uranium on its own soil
and to suggest that some economic
sanctions might be lifted as part of a deal,
and Iran has refused to agree even to a
limited deal called “stop, ship, and shut”
— involving the suspension of its
enrichment to 20 percent purity, shipping
its existing stockpiles of 20% uranium to
a third country for processing, and
shutting down its underground facility at
Fordo, near Qom — without an agreement
to lift sanctions.

After the reelection of Barack Obama in
November, there were great hopes that
the president would have greater political
freedom of offer concessions to Iran. Yet,
publicly at least, the White House isn’t
