Setting Sail on Gaza’s Sea of Spin

Ethan Bronner

July 2, 2011 -- SOME see a parallel with the Exodus, the ship filled
with Jewish refugees that tried to break the British blockade of
Palestine in 1947 and helped sway world opinion toward Zionism.
Others are struck by the insistence on transporting basic aid — food
and cement — when it is no longer needed. Still others note the way
the Israeli authorities portray the organizers as violent Islamists when
most are middle-aged European pacifists.

Almost everything about the flotilla stuck in Greece and waiting to
challenge Israel’s blockade of Gaza seems to be a parable for
something else, part of an unstated effort to recast the Israeli-
Palestinian narrative in extreme terms. Instead of helping to clarify
what Gaza needs and how it might build a future, the saga has merely
brought out the public relations demons on all sides.

Ostensibly the 10 or so boats, with several hundred advocates from
more than a dozen countries, are trying to take goods to Gaza because
of a siege imposed by Israel and Egypt to pressure Hamas, the
Islamist ruler there. A year ago a similar flotilla was stopped by the
Israeli Navy, and after commandos boarded and scuffles ensued, nine
activists were killed.

The international outrage that followed helped force an easing of the
siege. One result, largely unacknowledged by the flotilla leaders: far
more goods have gone into Gaza over the past year, and while the 1.6
million people there still need many things, basic supplies are not
among them.

Israel is therefore quick to say that Gaza is well provided for and does
not need any flotilla. [fit still wants to bring in aid, it should take it
