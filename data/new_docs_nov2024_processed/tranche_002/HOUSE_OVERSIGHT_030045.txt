see Colonel Qaddafi gone, he also said that the air war was unlikely
to accomplish that by itself. Most important, he vowed that there
would be no American ground troops in this fight. “If we tried to
overthrow Qaddafi by force,” he said, “our coalition would splinter.”
He said “regime change” in Iraq took eight years and cost thousands
of American and Iraqi lives. “That is not something we can afford to
repeat in Libya.” Instead, he said the United States and its allies
would work to increase the diplomatic and military pressure on
Colonel Qaddafi and his cronies. A meeting on Tuesday with allies
and members of the Libyan opposition is supposed to develop that
strategy along with ways to help the rebels build alternate, and we
hope humane and competent, governing structures. That needs to
start quickly. To hold their ground and protect endangered civilians,
let alone advance, the rebels will likely need air support for quite
some time. Mr. Obama was right not to promise a swift end to the air
campaign. At the same time, he should not overestimate the patience
of the American people or the weariness of the overstretched military.
And as Washington reduces its military role, others, inside and
outside NATO, will need to increase theirs. Within NATO,
unenthusiastic partners like Germany and Turkey need to at least stay
out of the way even if they continue to stand aside from the fighting.
The president made the right choice to act, but this is a war of choice,
not necessity. Presidents should not commit the military to battle
without consulting Congress and explaining their reasons to the
American people. Fortunately, initial coalition military operations
have gone well. Unfortunately, it is the nature of war that they will
not always go well. Mr. Obama needs to work with Congress and
keep the public fully informed. On Monday, he made an overdue start
on that.
