Hezbollah is a political party with a militia. That’s a big problem.
Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Shas party has an outsized influence over
Israel because of coalition politics. That’s a problem. The Muslim
Brotherhood will loom large in a free Egypt because it has an

silenced no longer. They wonder then if their own myriad agents can
be trusted. They are caught in their own web. They flail; they have
gone too far to turn back but cannot go forward.
