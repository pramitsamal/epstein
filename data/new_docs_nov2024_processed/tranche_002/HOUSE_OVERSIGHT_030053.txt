The West still beats the rest, but 1t may
no longer be best

March 29, 2011 -- History has no final verdicts. Major shifts in
events and power bring about new subjects for discussion and new
interpretations.

Fifty years ago, as decolonization accelerated, no one had a good
word to say for imperialism. It was regarded as unambiguously bad,
both by ex-imperialists and by their liberated subjects.
Schoolchildren were taught about the horrors of colonialism, how it
exploited conquered peoples. There was little mention, if any, of
imperialism’s benefits.

Then, in the 1980s, a revisionist history came along. It wasn’t just
that distance lends a certain enchantment to any view. The West —
mainly the Anglo-American part of it — had recovered some of its
pride and nerve under U.S. President Ronald Reagan and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. And there was the growing
evidence of post-colonial regimes’ failure, violence and corruption,
especially in Africa.

But the decisive event for the revisionists was the collapse of the
Soviet empire, which not only left the United States top dog globally,
but also seemed, to the more philosophically minded, to vindicate
Western civilization and values against all other civilizations and
values. With the European Union extending its frontiers to embrace
many ex-communist states, the West became again, if briefly, the
embodiment of universal reason, obliged and equipped to spread its
values to the still-benighted parts of the world. Francis Fukuyama’s
