even Alawite predominance, would never survive a system shaped by
free elections, the rule of law, and the existence of independent
media.

The New York Times interviews were made possible by the deep
uneasiness in the Obama administration with moves that might
destabilize the Assad regime. The Syrians are good judges of their
adversaries’ weaknesses, and what they see in Washington is a
president who prefers the Assads to the possibility of chaos. They
realize that the measures taken until now by the United States and
Europe have been relatively gentle, therefore wholly ineffective. Add
to that the U.N. Security Council’s recent failure to condemn Syria
and official Arab support for Syrian stability, and you will grasp why
the Assad regime saw an opening to reinforce American paralysis.
Nor can the Obama administration ignore that the Syrian leadership
regards American dithering as a sign of implicit approval of its
actions. Indeed, Shaaban described the recent statements of President
Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Syria as “not
too bad,” and the sanctions against Syria as manageable. That can
only mean one thing: If Washington fails to clarify its views on the
carnage in Syria through effective policies, the killing and the arrests
there will continue, with the U.S. bearing partial responsibility. The
White House’s uncertainty can be measured in human lives.

The Syrian protesters are right in not pursuing their salvation in
Washington, let alone Brussels, Paris, or London. This is not an
American administration overly outraged by the viciousness of
dictatorships. Even in Egypt, Obama only turned against Hosni
Mubarak when he was left with no other choice — although doing so
against an old ally while sparing Assad suggests that Obama is like
the coward who will yell at his wife to avoid a brawl with the
neighbor.
