Show goes on in Iraq's political circus

Sami Moubayed

May 28, 2011 -- DAMASCUS - Iraq has been absent from the
world's radar since upheaval rocked the Arab world in January,
toppling the regimes in Tunisia and Egypt and sending shockwaves
through Bahrain, Libya, Yemen and Syria.

A closer look at the political scene in Baghdad, however, shows that
all is not well. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is in hot water, like
many of his Arab counterparts - and his government might collapse
soon, if not through street power, then perhaps through the shattering
of the delicate balance in the upper echelons of Baghdad.

Last week Maliki hinted that he may resign and call new elections,
just five months after forming his second cabinet. Two months ago,
large and angry demonstrations broke out in Baghdad, inspired by the
Arab Spring, chanting against corruption, poor government services,
and the prime minister.

Among other things, he was accused of mismanagement of public
office, abuse of power, authoritarianism and sectarianism. Maliki
promised immediate action within the next 100 days. That deadline
expires in July and there is nothing on the horizon to prove that the
prime minister is willing, or capable, of living up to his promises.
There is also a daily barrage of accusations against him by his
predecessor Iyad Allawi, who is backed by Saudi Arabia and other
Arab heavyweights who are eager to topple Maliki - seen as an
extension of Iranian influence in the Arab and Muslim world.

Iraq remains sharply divided between the prime minister and Allawi.
The top seats in the ministries of defense and the interior are still
vacant, and Maliki still denies Allawi the right to name the minister
