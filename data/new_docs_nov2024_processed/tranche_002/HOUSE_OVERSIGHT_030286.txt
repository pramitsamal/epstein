doctor. You might think that imagining a future haircut would be
pretty dull. Not at all. Here is what one of my participants pictured:

I was getting my hair cut to donate to Locks of Love [a charity that
fashions wigs for young cancer patients]. It had taken me years to
grow it out, and my friends were all there to help celebrate. We went
to my favorite hair place in Brooklyn and then went to lunch at our
favorite restaurant.

I asked another participant to imagine a plane ride. I imagined the
takeoff — my favorite! — and then the eight-hour-long nap in
between and then finally landing in Krakow and clapping for the pilot
for providing the safe voyage, she responded. No tarmac delays, no
screaming babies. The world, only a year or two into the future, was a
wonderful place to live in.

If all our participants insisted on thinking positively when it came to
what lay in store for them personally, what does that tell us about
how our brains are wired? Is the human tendency for optimism a
consequence of the architecture of our brains?

The Human Time Machine

To think positively about our prospects, we must first be able to
imagine ourselves in the future. Optimism starts with what may be
the most extraordinary of human talents: mental time travel, the
ability to move back and forth through time and space in one's mind.
Although most of us take this ability for granted, our capacity to
envision a different time and place is in fact critical to our survival.

It is easy to see why cognitive time travel was naturally selected for
over the course of evolution. It allows us to plan ahead, to save food
and resources for times of scarcity and to endure hard work in
anticipation of a future reward. It also lets us forecast how our current
behavior may influence future generations. If we were not able to
picture the world in a hundred years or more, would we be concerned
