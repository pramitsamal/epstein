They may lead to more fulfilling jobs and stable relationships in the
future. Interpreting a misfortune in this way allows us to conclude
that our sunny expectations were correct after all — things did work

Silver Linings

How do we find the silver lining in storm clouds? To answer that, my
colleagues — renowned neuroscientist Ray Dolan and neurologist
Tamara Shiner — and I instructed volunteers in the {MRI scanner to
visualize a range of medical conditions, from broken bones to
Alzheimer's, and rate how bad they imagined these conditions to be.
Then we asked them: If you had to endure one of the following,
which would you rather have — a broken leg or a broken arm?
Heartburn or asthma? Finally, they rated all the conditions again.
Minutes after choosing one particular illness out of many, the
volunteers suddenly found that the chosen illness was less
