reasonable and realistic leaders should have nothing to fear from
Egypt, with which it has an enduring peace treaty.

The situation with Syria may not be exactly the same, however,
especially when the two countries are still officially in a state of war.
The regime of Bashar Assad, and his father before him, would have
never started a war with Israel unilaterally. It also suited them not to
have a peace treaty. Any new Syrian leader is not likely (for a
considerable period of time) to initiate a move toward a peace
agreement with Israel as this will weaken his position domestically.
Nor will he launch a war, however, since such a war will not result in
victory. A democratic regime in Syria, or any other Arab country for
that matter, will need a good 10 years to build democratic institutions
and stabilize a modern market economy needed in any democracy.
So, war won’t be on the agenda in the near future.

Prosperity increases the public’s stake in a stable economy, and this
will make people want to compromise to make their country more
prosperous and stable. However, everything will depend on how
prepared the free world is to help new democracies in the Middle
East survive and prosper. Small Islamic groups, organized and armed
with religious zeal, could hijack power from the moderates. This
would lead to a disaster for the whole region. Therefore, it 1s
imperative for the free world, Israel included, not to leave matters to
chance. A proactive stance is needed to nurture democracy and help
moderate forces organize themselves in order to govern the region
