Syria as Turkey’s domestic issue

Yusuf Kanli

May 15, 2011 -- Syria is no Libya for many reasons; not just because
it is a country right on the Turkish border or, like Turkey, it has a
Kurdish population and an explosion there may ignite an explosion
on this side of the border as well.

Like a broken watch that shows correct time twice a day, Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as well occasionally makes some
correct analysis. Last week, while comparing the uprising in Libya
against the Moammar Gadhafi regime and the growing unrest in the
Syrian street against the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad, the
prime minister correctly said Libya and Syria were two totally
different issues for Turkey.

Erdogan explained while Turkey was very much concerned with
what’s happening in Libya and have been undertaking every possible
effort to contribute to a quick end to the tumult and restoration of
peace and order in Libya, Syria was very much like a domestic
incident for Turkey.

As part of its neo-Ottoman drive to enhance its influence in the
Middle Eastern territory of the former Ottoman Empire the ruling
Justice and development Party, or AKP, government of Turkey has
long waived visa requirement in travel between Turkey and Syria.
The aim behind that move was to plant the seeds of a future European
Union-like Middle Eastern union led by Turkey but the first tangible
result was not a marked increase in commercial, business or tourist
interactions, but a batch of 250 refugees running from the fire on the
Syrian street.
