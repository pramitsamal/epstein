While Ankara may answer anti-Turkish demonstrations in Libya by
closing down the Turkish embassy in Tripoli, the first ever such
action by the diplomatic service throughout its modern history, anti-
Turkish demonstrations in Damascus can be really costly for Turkey
now and in the future.

While the personal friendly relations between Assad and his
counterpart in Turkey, Erdogan, might provide Turkey a golden
opportunity to help Syria sail out of the current tumultuous situation.
Of course at a time when Erdogan himself is after converting Turkey
into his sultanate of fear under the aegis of advanced democracy it
might be absurd to expect him to advise Assad of a democratic way
out of the mess in Syria. Yet, as much as Turkey needs to see
restoration of peace, security and stability in Syria for domestic
security reasons as well as for its regional role, Syria and President
Assad need Turkey and Erdogan to walk the extra mile in reforms
advised by them, as the real-politic of the day compels him to do so if
he wants to sail out of this problem in one piece.

If, however, despite Turkey’s democracy and reform preaches, the
massacres continue in the Syrian street not only the prestige of
Erdogan in the Arab street will be seriously impaired but sooner or
later the fire in the Arab street will have a reflection on the Turkish
streets.
