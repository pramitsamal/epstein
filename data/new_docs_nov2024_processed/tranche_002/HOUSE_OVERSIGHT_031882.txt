radical change, he will have to propose a constitution that represents
a national consensus. That can only be reached if the constitution
includes strong guarantees of free speech, rights for women, judicial
independence, and cultural freedom for all ethnic and religious
groups.

Such a constitution would embody the wishes of most Turks. It might
also reinvigorate Turkey’s stalled campaign to join the European
Union. If Turkey becomes an EU member by the time it celebrates its
100th anniversary in 2023, that would be Erdogan’s eternal legacy.
Turkey is poised to become one of the most successful countries of
the 21st century, a model of Muslim democracy and a powerful force
for regional peace. Whether it will fulfill its potential depends largely
on how Erdogan handles the mandate he has just won.
