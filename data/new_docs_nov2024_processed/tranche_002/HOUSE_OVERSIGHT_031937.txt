match, if not outdo, the impact of 9/11. Zawahiri, by contrast, favored
an opportunistic strategy of smaller strikes.

e Bin Laden was a hands-on chief executive, with a role in operations
planning and personnel decisions, rather than the detached senior
leader that U.S. analysts had hypothesized. Zawahiri, whom the
analysts had imagined as the day-to-day leader, was actually quite
isolated — and remains so, despite a dozen communications this
year. Zawahiri suffers from mistrust between his Egyptian faction of
al-Qaeda and other operatives, such as Atiyah.

eBin Laden was suffering badly from drone attacks on al-Qaeda’s
base in the tribal areas of Pakistan. He called this the “intelligence
war,” and said it was “the only weapon that’s hurting us.” His cadres
complained that they couldn’t train in the tribal areas, couldn’t
communicate, couldn’t travel easily and couldn’t draw new recruits
to what amounted to a free-fire zone. Bin Laden discussed moving al-
Qaeda’s base to another location, but he never took action.

Analysts did not find in the material any smoking gun to suggest
Pakistani government complicity in bin Laden’s presence in
Abbottabad. And it’s clear he was paranoid about being found and
killed: He ordered his subordinates to restrict movements to help
preserve what remained of al-Qaeda in Pakistan. Fear of being
discovered was a subject of regular conversation between bin Laden,
Atiyah, Zawahiri and others.

Bin Laden also worried that al-

Qaeda’s status among Muslims was dwindling, and that the West had
at least partially succeeded in distancing al-Qaeda’s message from
core Islamic values. Concerned about this eroding base, bin Laden
counseled affiliates in North Africa and Yemen to hold back on their
efforts to develop a local Islamic extremist state in favor of attacking
the United States and its interests.
