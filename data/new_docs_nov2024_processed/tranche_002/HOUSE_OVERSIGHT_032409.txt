brains and behaviors, can be replicably observed, and
it can be subjectively

apprehended by any conscious entity. But that's it.
Anyone who denies this understands neither physics
nor consciousness, and has a severe logic problem to
boot, inasmuch as he/she cannot properly distinguish
between cognition and perception or internal and

external state.

This isn't polemics. This is Just the way it is. Stop
overreaching.
