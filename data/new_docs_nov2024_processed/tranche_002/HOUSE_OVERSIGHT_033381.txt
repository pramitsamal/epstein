But the hour is late. Orban’s vision has gained considerable appeal throughout Europe. In 2014, when he declared
the end of the age of liberalism, he was seen as a pariah; today he is the leader of a xenophobic, authoritarian and
often anti-American trend that haunts Poland, Austria and Turkey. He has won many converts to the cause of
strengthening nation-states and weakening multilateral institutions, notably the European Union. His hostility to
migration, particularly what he calls the “Islamic multitude” that “leads to the disintegration of nations,” is widely
shared. He is admired for having built the first wall in Europe — on the Hungarian-Serbian border — to stem the flow
of migrants in 2015. (Paradoxically, Hungary used to be admired for tearing down the barrier between itself and
Austria, precipitating the fall of the Berlin Wall.)

confrontation with illiberalism — does not pay. Although we hope the Trump administration will reconsider its flawed
strategy, recent events are not promising.
