Q. You never read those reports?

A. I don't know which reports you're
referring to.

Q. All of the reports about Jeffrey Epstein.

MR. SCOTT: Asked and answered yesterday
on this whole line.

A. I probably did not read all the reports on
Jeffrey Epstein. I'm sure I've read some of them.

THE WITNESS: Right.

A. I don't remember my name coming up. [ was

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. To the extent that Bradley Edwards and
Paul Cassell relied upon detailed reports from the
Palm Beach police department in order to assess the
credibility of Virginia Roberts, would it be
reasonable for them to rely upon police reports?

A. I would hope that they would rely on all
the police reports, including the ones that showed
that she was involved in criminal actions, including
the ones that would show that she took money as an

MR. SCOTT: You know, you think this is
funny and I think this man's -- and I think
this man's --

MR. SCAROLA: I think it's improper for
you to be coaching the witness in the middle of
examination. If you think that there's
something that needs to be brought out, you do
that in cross examination. You don't feed him
information that you want him to be reading in
the middle of my examination of this witness.

MR. SCOTT: No. But it's also true that
under our rules, when you read portions of a
deposition, he has the ability to read other
portions of the deposition which clarify the
answers. That's done in every courtroom on
every time a witness -- you have selected
portions of it that are not accurate based on
other portions and I am having him review them
since you did not offer him the deposition to
review.

MR. SCAROLA: And that's what you do --

MR. SCOTT: And I think that's totally

Q. Would that include the reports of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation?

A. I would hope so.

Q. Would that include the information
provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office?

A. lL would sure hope so, and I could tell you

A. Let me just say that the U.S. Attorney's
Office lias told me unequivocally that my name never
came up in any context of any accusation against me

MR. SCOTT: No.

MR. SCAROLA: There's no question pending
as to which that's relevant. But let's take a

MR. SCOTT: Sure. Why don't you read it
into the record?

THE WITNESS: I've read it.

MR. SCOTT: Read it into the record so
that Mr. Scarola is advised.
A. Okay. When Alan Dershowitz was in the.
house, | understand you to say that these local
Palm Beach girls would come over to the house
while he was there, but you're not sure if he
had a massage from any of these girls?

Exactly.

“And what would he do while these girls
were in the house?

“He would read a book with a glass of

wine by the pool, stay inside.
Did he ever talk to any of the girls?
Il don't know, sir.
