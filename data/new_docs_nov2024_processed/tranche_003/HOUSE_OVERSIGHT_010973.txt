Another mini-surprise is the physics-like care in definitions. The reason is that my
arguments later will drive logic pretty far. Logic needs words that are like algeraic

symbols in meaning the same thing all along.

Figuratively and literally, foundations are groundwork. They will be less a chore if
you love logic. And you'd better if you’re going to like the later chapters. Let’s get

started.

Orientation

Economics itself, I think, is a quantitative rationale of choices. Psychology is a sister
study not explicitly quantitative, and accounting for subliminal behavior as well as
deliberate choices. The two fields cooperate and overlap. Economics is quantitative
in that it asks how much as well as what, and focuses on numbers. It is science-like
in that it looks for surprising and testable predictions in the end. It is philosophy-
like in that choices are subjective and that the larger factor, human capital, leaves
little market evidence from which to reason upward. Both facts put the burden on

reasoning downward from axioms.

Much of the evidence for both factors, meaning physical and human capital, comes
from the records of literal markets where we rent and hire and buy and sell. Most
economics looked no further until Gary Becker and others expanded the boundaries
about 50 years ago. The expansion made sense. A rationale of choices in literal
markets alone is a silly concept. It is silly to acknowledge only choices that ring cash
registers. We are the same people everywhere. Logic is the same everywhere. We
have little interest in axioms that aren’t the same everywhere. Becker was right to
see choices in marriage and even crime as predictable in terms of supply and

demand and price.

That includes psychic price. Once we follow Becker past literal markets, we accept

psychic value and yield. We must anyhow. Value is in the mind. Economics works as
