client in other articles and things. For example, there ar

statements about Bill Clinton being on the island, and the
defense wants to bring in those statements to show that -- they
believe they can show evidence that he wasn't on the island, so
therefore, my client is a liar or is lying about that.

to depose him because we were concerned about that fact, that

they were going to raise it, and we wanted to have him under

MS. McCAWLEY: Sure.
THE COURT: What and where was the statement made?

article. So not the two articles we showed you yesterday --
