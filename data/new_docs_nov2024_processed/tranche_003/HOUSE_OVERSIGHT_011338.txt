mistake, and that was indicated in the pleading withdrawing

Ww

the summary judgment motion as follows: Edwards and Cassell
do acknowledge that the public filing in the Crime Victims

Rights Act case of the client's allegations against Defendant
Dershowitz became a major distraction from the merits of the

well-founded Crime Victims Rights Act case by causing delay

and, as a consequence, turned out to be a tactical mistake.

Tactical mistake. For that reason Edwards and Cassell have
chosen to withdraw the referenced filing as a condition of the
SerteLement .

That's all a very interesting lawsuit, but that's a
lawsuit that does not have Ms. Giuffre as a party. It was

Cassell and Edwards versus Alan Dershowitz, with claims going

back and forth. Cassell and Edwards were, of course,

vindicating their own professional interests and their

professional reputation responding to the attacks that had been

made by Mr. Dershowitz, and they chose to settle the case, as
did Mr. Dershowitz, for undisclosed financial reasons.

And also, from the fact I think your Honor is now
aware, that there were some witnesses who were not available.
Sarah Ransome has come forward in this case to say that she was
a traffic to Alan Dershowitz in the same way that Ms. Giuffre
alleges, and that was information that has only recently become
available.

The point is, you have enough business on your hands
