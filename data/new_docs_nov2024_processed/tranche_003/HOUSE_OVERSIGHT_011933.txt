MC2 Modeling Agency Involved In Sex Trafficking

August 11,2010

On August 4th Jezebel ran the following story: The Sex-Trafficking Model Scout.

Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean
Luc Brunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, [assistant
and girlfriend Ghislaine] Maxwell, Brunel, [house manager Alfredo] Rodriguez, and Marcinkova
‘deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through
MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.

The previous paragraph in the story read:

and making [speaking of Jeffrey Epstein] frequent $100,000 donations to the Palm Beach Police
Department would insulate him from prosecution for his various depravities.

Which included, for the record: buying a 14-year-old Yugloslavian named Natalia Marcinkova
from her parents in order to keep Marcinkova as his sex slave: paying a retinue of women to
trawl Palm Beach for teenagers economically desperate enough to agree to give Epstein

massages that often led to sexual contact; receiving two 12-year-old French girls as a birthday
present; and befriending Michael Wolff.
