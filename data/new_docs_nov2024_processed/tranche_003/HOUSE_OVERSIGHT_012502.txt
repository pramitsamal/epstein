Go ahead, lawyer.

MR. LEOPOLD: All right. The exhibits, |

can't prevent you from taking them, but | wil!
object and | will be bringing. it to the court for
sanctions. You cannot take the exhibits out of
the room without them being marked. | want them
marked, because you cannot identify in the record
what was used. And with all due respect to
Mr. Goldberger, | do not -- the way this
deposition is going, | do not want to rely on
Counsel from Miami to mark the appropriate
exhibits. | will not do that. Jt cannot prevent
you from taking them. But if you do, | will be
bringing the matter to the court with appropriate
sanctions, because that is improper. That is
improper. When you use something in a deposition,
they are to be marked. And you have refused to do
that throughout for what ever reason.

MR. TEIN: You're wrong. Finish your
sentence because you're talking about something
you have no idea.

Every single one is marked, Ted. Every
single one is already marked. But you want to
argue about everything. Ever single one is
already marked. Isn't that silly, Ted?

MR. GOLDBERGER: Thirty years of doing this

and | have never had an argument over this.
