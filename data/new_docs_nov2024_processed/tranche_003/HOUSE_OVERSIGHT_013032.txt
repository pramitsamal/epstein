116 6 A Brief Overview of CogPrime

6.7 Conclusion

To thoroughly describe a comprehensive, integrative AGI architecture in a brief chapter would
be an impossible task; all we have attempted here is a brief overview, to be elaborated on in
the 800-odd pages of Part 2 of this book. We do not expect this brief summary to be enough to
convince the skeptical reader that the approach described here has a reasonable odds of success
at achieving its stated goals, or even of fulfilling the conceptual notions outlined in the preceding
chapters. However, we hope to have given the reader at least a rough idea of what sort of AGI
design we are advocating, and why and in what sense we believe it can lead to advanced artificial
general intelligence. For more details on the structure, dynamics and underlying concepts of
CogPrime, the reader is encouraged to proceed to Part 2- after completing Part 1, of course.
Please be patient — building a thinking machine is a big topic, and we have a lot to say about
it!
