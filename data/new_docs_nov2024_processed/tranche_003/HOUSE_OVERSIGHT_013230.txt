314 17 A Preschool-Based Roadmap to Advanced AGI

e Appropriate Social Behavior
— Example task: The robot should learn to clean up and put away its toys when it’s
done playing with them.
e Social Communication
— Example task: The robot should greet new human entrants into the lab, but if it
knows the new entrants very well and it’s busy, it may eschew the greeting
e Social Inference about simple social relationships
— Example task: The robot should infer that Cassio and Ben are friends because they
often enter the lab together, and often talk to each other while they are there
Group Play at loosely-organized activities
— Example task: The robot should be able to participate in “informally kicking a ball
around” with a few people, or in informally collaboratively building a structure with
blocks

12. Communication

e Gestural communication to achieve goals and express emotions
— Example task: If the robot is asked where the red ball is, it should be able to show
by pointing its hand or finger
Verbal communication using English in its life-context
— Example tasks: Answering simple questions, responding to simple commands, de-
scribing its state and observations with simple statements
Pictorial Communication regarding objects and scenes it is familiar with
— Example task: The robot should be able to draw a crude picture of a certain tower
of blocks, so that e.g the picture looks different for a very tall tower and a wide low
one
e Language acquisition
— Example task: The robot should be able to learn new words or names via people
uttering the words while pointing at objects exemplifying the words or names
Cross-modal communication
— Example task: If told to touch Bob’s knee but the robot doesn’t know what a
knee is, being shown a picture of a person and pointed out the knee in the picture
should help it figure out how to touch Bob’s knee

13. Quantitative

e Counting sets of objects in its environment
— Example task: The robot should be able to count small (homogeneous or heteroge-
neous) sets of objects
e Simple, grounded arithmetic with small numbers
— Example task: Learning simple facts about the sum of integers under 10 via teaching,
reinforcement and imitation
e Comparison of observed entities regarding quantitative properties
— Example task: Ability to answer questions about which object or person is bigger
or taller
e Measurement using simple, appropriate tools
— Example task: Use of a yardstick to measure how long something is
