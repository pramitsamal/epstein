JUDGE TO RULE ON SEALED PLEA-DEAL PAPERS TODAY Palm Beach Daily News June 25, 2009 Thursday

Radaronline.com has reported that Epstein has secretly been helping the feds unravel a Ponzi scheme related to
the June 2008 indictment of two former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund.

Epstein's rep, Howard Rubenstein, confirmed last year that Epstein is Major Investor No. 1 in the indictment,
which says he lost about $57 million.

Goldberger could not be reached for comment.

The Manhattan money manager has been incarcerated since June 30, when he pleaded guilty to the two felony
counts. As part of the plea agreement, Epstein must serve one year of house arrest after his release and register as a life-
long sex offender.

In addition to the criminal case, there are more than a dozen civil lawsuits -- both state and federal -- pending
against Epstein. All contain similar allegations: Epstein, through his employees and assistants, brought minor girls to his
Palm Beach home on El Brillo Way for erotic massages and sometimes sex.
