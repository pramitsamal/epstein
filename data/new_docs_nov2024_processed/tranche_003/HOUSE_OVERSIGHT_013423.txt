Ghislaine Maxwell, the British brunette whose father once
owned the Daily News, has been slapped with a subpoena in
suits brought by 24 underage girls against her old friend,
billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.

Maxwell -- whose press-lord father, Robert Maxwell, died in
1991 after falling into the Atlantic off his yacht, the Lady
Ghislaine -- was served with a subpoena on Sept. 22 at 6:45
p.m. as she was leaving the Clinton Global Initiatives
Conference at the Sheraton Hotel.

Florida lawyer Brad Edwards, who represents three of the
Jane Does who are suing Epstein, told Page Six that
Maxwell would be questioned over her knowledge of how
Epstein procured many of the girls.

Epstein is accused in the civil complaints of luring underage
girls to his mansion in Palm Beach to give him massages,
during which he allegedly engaged them in sexual activity and
paid them hundreds of dollars each. A grand jury indicted
Epstein on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution.
Epstein, who pleaded guilty and did 12 months in prison, was
deposed last week in the offices of his lawyer, Jack
Goldberger.

Goldberger wouldn't comment, but a friend of Epstein said,
These [people bringing the complaint] are the lowest of the
lows in terms of ambulance-chasing lawyers. The trials are
scheduled to start in February.
