Reached by phone at his Palm Beach home, media mogul Black said he knew Epstein as “a friend of my colleague Mr.
Wexner.”

Les Wexner, CEO of The Limited Brands, was reported to have been Epstein’s biggest client and close friend. Wexner
replaced Epstein as his money manager, according to recent reports.

Some of the names in Epstein’s book are sub-listed under geographic locations. The heading “massage” is notated
under many of Epstein’s locations. Names and phone numbers, most of them first names only, are listed under the
massage entries.

Registered as a level 3 sex offender, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting underage girls for sex at his El Brillo Way home

in Palm Beach. In addition to serving 13 months of an 18-month jail sentence, Epstein has settled at least two dozen
lawsuits with young women for undisclosed amounts.
