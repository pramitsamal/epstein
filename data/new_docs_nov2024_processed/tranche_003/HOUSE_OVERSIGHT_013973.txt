= World Electric Guide ( www.kropla.com )

Figure out outlets, voltage, mobile phones, international dialing codes, and all sorts of things related to
electric mismatching worldwide.

Cheap and Round-the-World Airfare

> Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), Kayak (www.kayak.com), and Sidestep (www.sidestep.com)

Search 400+ airlines worldwide for each service. Orbitz is my starting point for pricing comparisons,
after which I check both Kayak and Sidestep. Sidestep has proven most effective when searching for
flights that start and end outside of the U.S.

= TravelZoo Top 20 ( http://top20.travelzoo.com /)

Moscow for $129 one-way? These last-minute weekly travel specials might be the push you need to pull
the trigger.

=> Priceline ( www.priceline.com )

Start bidding at 50% of the lowest Orbitz fare and move up in $50 increments.

» CFares ( www.cfares.com )

Consolidator fares with free and low-cost memberships. I found a round-trip ticket from California to
Japan for $500.

> 1-800-FLY-EUROPE ( www.1800flyeurope.com )
I used this to get the $300 roundtrip from JFK to London that left two hours later.
