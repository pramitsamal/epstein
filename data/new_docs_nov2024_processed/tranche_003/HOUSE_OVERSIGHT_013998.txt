- | pair of Reef sandals. Best to get a pair with removable straps
that go around the heel.

» | Canon PowerShot SD300 digital camera with extra 2GB SD
memory card. God, I love this camera more than words can
describe. It is the best designed piece of electronics I have ever
owned. I now use it not only for all of my photos and videos, but
also as a replacement for my scanner. I’m considering testing the
newer and cheaper SD1000.

- | coffee-harvesting hat to prevent my pale skin from burning off
» | Kiva keychain expandable duffel bag

- | Chapstick, | Mag-Lite Solitaire flashlight, and 1 roll of athletic
tape. The last is a lifesaver. It’s as useful as duct tape for repairing
objects but gentle enough to use on injuries, which I am fond of
inflicting on myself.

- | Lewis and Clark flex lock (for luggage, lockers, zippers, or
whatever I need to lock down/shut together). Standard mini-
padlocks are often too cumbersome to thread through holes on
lockers, etc.

» | Radio Shack kitchen timer, which I’ve been using to wake up for
about four years. The problem with using a cell phone alarm to
wake up is simple: The phone often needs to be on, and even if
you use vibrate, people can call and wake you up before you want
to wake up. The second benefit to using a kitchen timer is that
you know exactly how much sleep you are—or aren’t— getting,
and you can experiment with things like caffeine power naps of
different durations ... but that’s another post;)
