1. Setting appointments and meetings takes a lot of time. Have your assistant set things up for you in
Google Calendar. I input my own items via my Palm Z22 or iCal, then use Spanning Sync and Missing
Sync for Palm OS to syne everything. On my tiberlight Sony VAIO, which I still use for travel, I use
CompanionLink for Google Calendar. I suggest batching meetings or calls in one or two set days, with
15 minutes between appointments. Scattering them throughout the week at odd times just interrupts
everything else. (Update 2009: The Palm Z22 has been discarded, and I now use a 13-inch MacBook and
BusySync to synchronize iCal with Google Calendar.)

2. If you jump in your assistant’s inbox and answer anything, BCC them so they are aware that you
handled it.

3. Expect small problems. Life is full of compromises, and it’s necessary to let small bad things happen
if you want to get huge good things done. There is no escape. Prevent all problems and get nothing done,
or accept an allowable level of small problems and focus on the big things.

Ready to jump in and test the holy grail? Here are the steps.

1. Determine exactly which accounts you will use and how you want them to respond to (or just
categorize or purge) e-mail for you.

2. Find a virtual assistant.

3. Test for reliability before skill set. Have the top three candidates do something on tight deadline (24
hours) before hiring them and letting them in your inbox.

4. Use a probationary period of 2-4 weeks to test the waters and work out the problems. Again: There
will be problems. It will take a good 3-8 weeks to get to real smooth sailing.

5. Design your ideal lifestyle and find something to do other than let your brain fester in the inbox. Fill
the void.
