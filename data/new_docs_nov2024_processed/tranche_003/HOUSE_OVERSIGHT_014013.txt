o » How long would the keynote presentation be? Or would it be a
Q&A panel?

o» Do you cover travel and accommodation along with a
speaker’s fee?

o » What is your budget for keynote presentations?

o » Have any other speakers confirmed to present?
As soon as I hear back, I can speak with Tim about the possibilities of making this happen.
Thanks again!
Warmly,

Proposal to Work Remotely on a Contract Basis

This is the actual remote-work proposal reader Autumn Brookmire used successfully to move to
Argentina while retaining her job and cutting back to 5—10 hours per week of work.

AUTUMN BROOKMIRE July 2008
Background

After working for the [company name] for more than two years, I have a great loyalty to the people and
mission of this organization. I believe I have added a great deal of value to the organization in my
position as marketing coordinator. With my creative problem solving and my cost effective solutions I
have changed the way we produce and distribute our holiday cards and I’ve developed a contest to bring
in more usable photos for our marketing and publications. I would like to propose continuing to perform
the following tasks for [company name], but on a contract basis, remotely. I plan to live in Argentina for
6-12 months starting in September of 2008. My goals are to develop my fluency in the Spanish language
and immerse myself in another culture and completely foreign environment so that I develop my skills in
adaptation to new ways of thinking.
