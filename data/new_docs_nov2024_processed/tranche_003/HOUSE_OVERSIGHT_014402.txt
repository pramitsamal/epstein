the BoJ's new interest-pegging regime ensures that financial conditions will become increasingly stimulatory
as inflation rises.

2017 - a year of recovering domestic demand

We think the economy is heading towards a cyclical sweet spot and see a broad-based recovery in domestic
demand. Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the saving rate peaks; 2) capex should
accelerate in response to the improving demand outlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and low-for-
longer real rates; and 3) increased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up
the velocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy.

Biggest risk factor: US policy uncertainty

External developments pose the greatest risk to our forecasts, chief among them US policy uncertainty. The
downside scenario for Japan is a combination of rising US protectionism, sliding global trade, and a stronger
yen, which could reduce 2017 growth to zero. The Trump presidency may increase pressure on Japan to
achieve greater military self-reliance, boosting defense spending. There will also be greater incentives to
deepen economic and trade linkages with key regional players, such as China and Russia.
