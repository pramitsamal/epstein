Analysis by METI suggests that many of these non-manufacturing industries have the
scope to raise productivity. Wholesale/retail, utilities, and eating & accommodation have
particularly low levels of productivity relative to the US (Chart 18). We think the solution
is to boost capex, especially in ICT and automation. More broadly, an acceleration in
capex is needed if we are to see a pick-up in productivity and sustained profits. Though
we are by no means in the late stages of the profit cycle, the trend clearly points to
higher wage costs going forward, requiring proactive efficiency-enhancing investment
by corporates. Bottom-up data capex data for MSCI Japan also suggest that the
investment cycle has troughed and will pick up next year as earnings momentum
improves (Chart 19).

3. Policy priorities and redistribution

We think an increase in government pressure on corporations could speed up income
redistribution at the margin, ensuring that money circulates to those sectors and agents
with a higher propensity to consume. Elevated corporate savings remain a focal point
for the government. Cabinet Office officials have used the concept of the “cash-out
ratio” to highlight the creaky transmission from corporate profits to spending. Chart 20

3 The idea of the “cash-out” ratio was first raised by private sector representatives of the Council on
Fiscal and Economic Policy. The measure is defined as cash out / cash and deposits. The numerator
includes capex, personnel expenses, R&D, dividends, and changes in equity investments in related
companies, The denominator includes cash and deposits, and securities, short-term lending, and
investment securities classified under liquid assets. Since we are restricted to Ministry of Finance
Corporate survey data, our version of the “cash-out ratio” is defined as capex + personnel costs +
dividends / cash and liquid assets.
