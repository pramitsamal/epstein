V.I. businesses face higher unemployment taxes
as territory struggles to pay down $69 million debt

By BRIAN O’CONNOR
Daily News Staff

Territory business owners will pay
four times the normal federal unem-
ployment tax rate this year because
of an unpaid government debt, docu-
ments show.

The federal unemployment insur-
ance tax rate is traditionally 6 per-
cent on the first $7,000 an employee
makes. However, the federal govern-
ment usually offers a credit of 5.4
percent, meaning most employers ac-
tually pay about 0.6 percent, accord-
ing to the IRS.

States — and territories — with
unemployment insurance programs
meeting federal standards are re-
quired to meet their unemployment
obligations. When a state can’t meet
its unemployment obligations, it’s
entitled to take loans from the Fed-
eral Unemployment Insurance Trust
Fund.

Federal documents show only one
state and one jurisdiction — Califor-
nia and the U.S. Virgin Islands — are
currently in that position.

The territory owes $69,138,266.61
in loans, according to the U.S. De-
partment of Treasury website.

In fiscal year 2017, which be-
gan Oct. 1, the loans have accrued
$294,349.15 in interest payments
alone.

The VI. Labor Department is in
charge of administering unemploy-
ment insurance. Labor Commission-
er Catherine Hendry did not return a
number of phone calls seeking com-
ment.

Government House spokeswoman
Cherie Munchez would not com-
ment, saying that Hendry would issue
a prepared statement about the debt
by Wednesday.

Provisions of the Federal Unem-
ployment Tax Act stipulate that in
states or territories with outstanding
balances in the fund, businesses are
subject to a credit reduction, which is
collected and directed toward the un-
paid balance, according to Robert Pa-
vosevich, Supervisor of the Actuarial
Team in the Office of Unemployment

Insurance’s Division of Fiscal and
Actuarial Services in the Department
of Labor.

Virgin Islands business owners
will pay the original 0.6 percent, plus
an additional 1.8 percent caused by
the unpaid balance, for a total of 2.4
percent, Pavosevich said.

At the fully discounted rate, an
employer would pay $42 for each
employee earning $7,000. At the Vir-
gin Islands rate, employers will have
to pay $168.

After two years with an unpaid
balance, the discount decreases by
0.3 percent each year until the total
discount disappears, Pavosevich said.

“It’s capped at 6 percent,” Pavosev-
ich said.

At the full 6 percent, employers
will have to pay $420 for each new
employee earning $7,000 that comes
on board. By law, that money can’t
come out of the wages themselves
and is paid out of the profits or losses
that employers face, said Charles
Engeman, an attorney who served on
the Unemployment Insurance Advi-
sory Council under the administra-
tion of Goy. John deJongh Jr.

Without payment on the loan — or
waivers or relief, which has happened
three times since 2013 — the rate is
scheduled to max out by 2028. That’s
barring the imposition of step in-
creases, which can happen if the state
has an outstanding balance for a cer-
tain number of years, or if — as was
the case in the tax year 2012 — step
increases are piled on by other provi-
sions of the law, which could move
the unemployment tax rate up faster.

“Tt looks like they’re not making
much headway,” Pavosevich said, re-
ferring to the territory’s debt.

The territory wasn’t alone in 2011,
the first year the rate went up. In all,
20 states and the Virgin Islands re-
ceived a 0.3 percent credit reduction
that year, federal documents show.

That’s in part because of the linger-
ing effects of the Great Recession,
said Bennett Chan, a lawyer who
represents several businesses and has
worked with the St. Thomas-St. John
Chamber of Commerce in the past.

| don’t think there’s enough political willpower to do
the kinds of thing necessary to fix the system.

Council under the administration of Gov. John deJongh Jr.

The business owners always bear the brunt of
whatever deficiencies we have. We have to, at some
point, find other sources of revenue for the
government. Any time there's any sort of additional
tax burden, fee burden, licensing burden, it’s always

a point of concern.

— Kimberly McCollum,

president of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce

In general terms, states collected
more money than they paid out dur-
ing the years leading up to the 2008
market collapse, creating large sur-
pluses. Sometimes those surpluses
were subject to financial raids. Other
times — as was the case in the ter-
ritory — the surpluses were used as
a cause to reduce the amounts col-
lected for unemployment insurance.
When large-scale unemployment hit
as a result of the recession, surpluses
turned into deficits, Chan said.

“A lot of states were blindsided
by the Great Recession,’ Chan said.
“They also had big surpluses and
never foresaw that there would be
this sudden inflow in unemployment
claims.”

Territorial officials were late in re-
acting to bring the rate back up to ad-
dress the issue, Chan said.

“Tf we had done it earlier, we prob-
ably would have collected enough,”
he said. “Now they want to make it
up when times are hard.”

In many cases, the government
can’t say what each employer owes

or has paid in surplus, Engeman said.

The system originally was set up so
that employers faced a roller coaster,
Engeman said.

Each employer had a rate based
on a three-year average. If an em-
ployer’s account paid out more in
benefits than they contributed, the
rate would go up to 5.4 percent. After
three years, the employer's rate would
drop down to 0.1 percent, because at
5.4 percent, the rate exceeded likely
contributions.

At 0.1 percent, if anyone were laid
off, it immediately moved the em-
ployer back to the 5.4 percent rate.
Employers would oscillate between
the 5.4 percent rate and the 0.1 per-
cent rate.

“Tt was 5.4 for many employers,
and that’s what an average employer
would pay out over the course of 17
years for one employee,” Engeman
said.

As a result, the unemployment
insurance fund accumulated large
surpluses. To reduce the surpluses,
the VI. Labor Department dropped

the automatic increase based on a
negative account, and lowered the
minimum rate to 0. Less money came
in, even as unemployment rates re-
mained high and benefits remained
expensive.

A few steps could help move
the system back to sound footing,
Engeman said. For example, better
record-keeping would help reduce
delinquencies. Reducing unem-
ployment insurance benefits and
reducing the amount of time the
unemployed are eligible for unem-
ployment would both help. Verify-
ing that those collecting unemploy-
ment are seeking employment, and
generally reducing fraud also would
help, Engeman said.

“T don’t think there’s enough politi-
cal willpower to do the kinds of thing
necessary to fix the system,” he said.

Chamber of Commerce officials
on both islands decried any increase
in taxes or fees for businesses.

“Despite what the governor and
the senators think, the economy of
the Virgin Islands is not doing that
well,” said Tom Brunt III, a member
of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber
of Commerce Board of Directors.

Kimberly McCollum, president of
the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce,
said any increases to fees or taxes was
worrying.

“The business owners always bear
the brunt of whatever deficiencies we
have,” she said. “We have to, at some
point, find other sources of revenue
for the government. Any time there’s
any sort of additional tax burden, fee
burden, licensing burden, it’s always
a point of concern.”

The folly of the situation is com-
pounded by the fact that business
owners themselves aren’t allowed to
file for unemployment if they lose
their jobs, McCollum said.

“You're still paying unemployment
taxes on what you’re paid, but you are
not allowed to request compensation
should you find yourself in a position
to file for unemployment,” she said.
