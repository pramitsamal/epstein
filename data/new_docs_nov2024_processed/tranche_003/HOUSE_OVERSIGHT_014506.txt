VIRGIN ISLANDS

Prosecutors: white powder
letters contained hoodoo curse

By SUZANNE CARLSON
Daily News Staff

A woman facing federal criminal
charges for mailing letters contain-
ing white powder was attempting to
place a hoodoo curse on her ene-
mies, according to court documents
filed by prosecutors in the case.

Eugenia Winston, who is facing
32 counts of mailing threatening
communications, placed “hotfoot”
powder into envelopes containing
subpoenas that she mailed to wit-
nesses set to testify against her in
a civil lawsuit against her former
employer, Scotiabank, according to
court documents.

Hoodoo, also known as “root-
work,” is a traditional African
American folk spirituality that de-
veloped from a number of West
African spiritual traditions and be-
liefs.

The detail came in prosecutors’
opposition to Winston’s motion to
suppress all of her statements to au-
thorities, which was filed Monday.

Winston has been free on unse-
cured bond since Sept. 1, and her
civil lawsuit against Scotiabank al-
leging employment discrimination
and harassment has been placed on
hold until the criminal case against
her is resolved.

At a detention hearing on Sept. 1,
Federal prosecutor Chris Fisanick
said Winston’s actions were a clear
threat intended to terrorize the re-
cipients of the letters, and made ref-
erence to the 2001 anthrax attacks.

Postal Inspector Eric Oram said
at the hearing that the substance
was determined to be nontoxic and
was likely baby powder, cornstarch,
or a similar substance.

Winston’s attorney, Assistant
Federal Public Defender Gabriel
Villegas, argued that Winston is
the victim of an unfortunate mis-
understanding, and she accidentally
spilled body powder over and into
the envelopes.

However, Monday’s filing by
federal prosecutors paints a slight-
ly different picture of Winston’s

Hoodoo, also known
as “rootwork,” is a

spirituality that
developed from a
number of West African
spiritual traditions and
beliefs.

actions.

“Winston mailed over 30 en-
velopes that contained ‘hotfoot’
powder and subpoenas to various
individuals in the Virgin Islands.
Hotfoot powder is a hoodoo curse
designed to prevent witnesses from
appearing in court to testify,” ac-
cording to the filing.

“Hotfoot” powder is a hoodoo
practice of mixing various ingre-
dients — often some combination
of cayenne pepper, Sulphur, copper
sulphate, cornstarch and other ele-
ments — which is believed to drive
away enemies. Commercial ver-
sions of the powder also are avail-
able for sale online.

Recipients of Winston’s letters
were mainly witnesses who might
testify against Winston in her law-
suit against Scotiabank, and also in-
cluded U.S. Magistrate Judge Ruth
Miller, the legal counsel for Scotia-
bank and Winston’s former counsel
in her suit against Scotiabank, ac-
cording to prosecutors.

Because the envelopes had a
return address of the U.S. Court-
house on St. Thomas, “despite the
fact that Winston was serving these
subpoenas herself,” some of the en-
velopes that could not be delivered
were returned to the courthouse and
opened by staff there, according to
prosecutors.

“Believing the powder to be an-
thrax or some other deadly biologi-
cal toxin, the United States Court-
house was evacuated and closed;

the employees in the courthouse
who were exposed to the powder
were quarantined for hours,” ac-
cording to the filing.

The incident caused significant
disruption at the courthouse and at
the private law office of attorney
Bennett Chan near the West Indian
Co. cruise ship dock.

“The purpose of lacing these en-
velopes with hotfoot powder was to
instill fear and intimidation in the
witnesses to prevent their testify-
ing against Winston,” according to
prosecutors’ filing.

The filing does not indicate how
authorities determined the sub-
stance in the envelopes was hotfoot
powder or what ingredients were in
the powder.

Winston admitted to FBI in-
vestigators shortly after the enve-
lopes were received that she was
the sender. But Villegas has filed a
motion to suppress all of her state-
ments to law enforcement, saying
she was not properly advised of her
right to avoid self-incrimination.

But prosecutors shot back in
Monday’s filing, saying there is no
evidence in a video-recorded inter-
view with Winston that authorities
did not properly advise her of her
rights or attempt to intimidate her
to give a statement in any way.

Villegas wrote in his motion that
“the videotaped interview speaks
for itself.”

However, prosecutors wrote that
“the most cursory view of Winston’s
video recorded interview with law
enforcement agents establishes be-
yond cavil that Winston was never
coerced, was properly and repeat-
edly advised of her rights, and
consciously waived those rights,”
according to Monday’s filing. “The
first thirty seconds of the interview
wholly defeats Winston’s meritless
motion.”

Winston is scheduled to go to
trial on Jan. 11 before U.S. District
Judge Juan Sanchez.
