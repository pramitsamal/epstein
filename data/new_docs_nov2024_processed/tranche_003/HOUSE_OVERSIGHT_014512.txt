Tuesday, December 13, 2016 ISLAND LIFE

Crowley Caribbean Services went to the Oswald Harris Court neighborhood on St. Thomas recently on behalf
of the Crowley Cares Foundation and spent time sprucing up the Boys and Girls Club. Crowley personnel from
St. Thomas, St. Croix, and the states helped to clean up and paint the facility and donated furniture for the
children to use for their arts and craft programs. The Crowley Cares Foundation allows employees to make
monthly contributions, which the company matches, to nonprofit groups in the communities Crowley serves
as a cargo carrier. Crowley also delivered a check to help the club purchase a laptop computer. In addition to
the contributions, employees donate their time to community groups like the Boys and Girls Club.

Students’ cultural calendar
also marks V.I. centennial

The students of the St. Croix
Educational Complex are work-
ing on a collaborative project to
celebrate the upcoming centen-
nial anniversary of the U.S. Virgin
Islands.

Called the Virgin Islands Cul-
tural Contributors Calendar Cre-
ation and Theatrical Performance,
he project consists of a 12-month
calendar featuring 12 V.I. cultural
contributors, accompanied by live
interviews.

Visual arts, drama and speech
eachers Danica David and Say-
eeda Carter are the directors of
he project and are using students
from their classes and the school’s
Art Club to bring the vision to life.

Art Club students will use pho-
ographs of selected participants
o create mixed media portraits
for the calendar. Simultaneously,
Carter’s drama and speech stu-
dents will conduct interviews
with the participants that will be
used to create brief write-ups to
go along with the graphics.

The cultural contributors were
selected based on being natives of
the Virgin Islands or residents for
at least 15 years and also active
contributors to the development
of Virgin Islands’ culture through
fine arts, education, literature,
and history.

The students will formally pres-

ent the finished project at a recep-
tion that will feature an art exhibi-
tion and theatrical performances
embracing V.I. culture and hon-
oring the contributors. The event
will take place at St. Croix Educa-
tional Complex in January. Calen-
dars are available at the school in
December for $12 each.

The educator duo, David and
Carter, developed the project so
Virgin Islands students could
learn about the individuals in
their community that aid in the
advancement of local culture. The
calendar is expected to be pro-
duced annually.

The project is sponsored by Ro-
tary Club of St. Croix, Mid Isle
and the Community Foundation of
the Virgin Islands.
