The St. John Singers will perform two holiday concerts with guest soprano
Laura Strickling on Dec. 21 at Nazareth Lutheran Church in Cruz Bay and on
Dec. 23 at Emmaus Moravian Church in Coral Bay.

St. John Singers welcome guest
soprano for holiday concerts

The St. John Singers are celebrat-
ing their 35th anniversary with a
special guest at two holiday con-
certs during the week preceding
Christmas.

Soprano Laura Strickling, who has
a home on St. Thomas, will be per-
forming with the choir at their annual
concerts in Cruz Bay and Coral Bay
on St. John.

Strickling has been described as
possessing “‘a flexible voice, crystal-
line diction, and warm presence” by a
reviewer in the New York Times. She
has received numerous awards for her
performances of opera, classical and
contemporary music.

“We were very lucky to get her,”
said Janice Ballard, who has directed
the St. John Singers for the last five
years. “She was on St. Thomas and
had only a four-day window between

other engagements to sing with us.”

The singers’ selections will include
carols from around the world, and in
keeping with the tradition, the audi-
ence will be invited to sing along
with the choir on a medley of holiday
songs.

This year the choir will be accom-
panied on piano by Arboris de Jesus,
a talented young musician who was
born in Puerto Rico and raised on St.
Thomas. She now studies music at
Lawrence University.

The St. John Singers concerts
will be held on Dec. 21 at Naza-
reth Lutheran Church in Cruz Bay,
and on Dec. 23 at Emmaus Mora-
vian Church in Coral Bay. Both
concerts will begin at 7:30 p.m.
Tickets, which are available at the
door, are $20. Children are admit-
ted for free.
