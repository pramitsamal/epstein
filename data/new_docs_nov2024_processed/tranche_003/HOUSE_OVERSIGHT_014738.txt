2. Learning from Japanese fiscal stimulus

Ultimately, fiscal stimulus is not the long-term answer to flat curves or low neutral rates
Qapan being the prime example). Fiscal stimulus merely captures some low-hanging fruit
that extends the business cycle by a couple of years and provides the central bank an
opportunity to get further away from the ZLB. Said simply, fiscal stimulus raises the
terminal rate in the current business cycle while doing little for the long-run neutral rate
— this by definition should be more bearish for intermediate rates than 30y rates.

3. Additional deficit issuance

With the average maturity of UST debt already standing at record highs (7Omonths),
Treasury showing an inclination to cut long-end issue sizes in 2016, and the supply
shortfall in the front end of the UST curve post MMF reform, we also believe that the
US Treasury will finance the increased deficit using the belly of the UST curve as
opposed to the long end

Trade: We recommend a 3m5y OTM payer 25 delta, strike = 2.05% for a gross
payoff ratio of 3.4: 1. See the Best Vol Trades section for more details and risks.

But focus on being short real rates now

After spending much of 2016 successfully being long real rates, we recommend
switching to a real rate short for 2017. We think the consensus was too slow to get on
the real rate train and is now too long relative to benchmark. As described in the detail
here, fiscal stimulus is likely to leave government and private companies competing for
a shrinking pool of savings, driving the real cost of debt higher. We highlight three
reasons why short real rates provides better risk-reward now (Chart 15).

¢ Anti-globalization = higher real rates: Few appreciate that one of the biggest
beneficiaries of globalization has been US real rates. Globalization was undoubtedly
good for EM growth and reserves. As these reserves found their way back into the
US, US real interest rates were held lower. As the global savings glut unwinds, real
rates have the most room to re-price. Chart 16 offers compelling proof.

« _ Risk parity unwind = higher real rates: Exposure to any heightened concern about
a risk parity deleveraging trade in a high vol environment is best found in asset
classes where their footprint is large relative to market liquidity. TIPS is a prime
example of one such asset class. The influence of a multi-asset strategy on real
rates is clear from Chart 17.

- Lower rates = lower breakevens: If the recent euphoria unwinds, it is likely due to
a1) RMB deval; 2} commodity collapse post OPEC; or 3) equity market correction.
