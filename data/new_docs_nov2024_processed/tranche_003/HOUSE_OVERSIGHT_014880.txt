Impact on cash flow
While the impact on production is significant, we suggest the impact on cash flow is
transformational for Hess. Referencing the charts below:

¢ Under our base case that assumes $70 oil from 2020, we estimate operating
cash flow net to Hess would reach over $2.5bn;

¢ Net free cash flow peaks at over $2bn with a net cash outflow at any point in
the development of ~$300mm.

While first oil in 2019 is only the early stage of development, it is enough in our view to
provide visibility on multiple compression perceived absent from Hess’ investment case
given its focus on short cycle development. However, after the low point in production
in 2Q17 we suggest Hess has both — short cycle, comprising not only the Bakken but tie
back opportunities across established infrastructure in Norway and the US GoM — and
long cycle in the shape of a transformational opportunity in Guyana, that becomes
tangible with a likely FID in 2Q17.

Impact on valuation

In our view, an imminent inflexion point in free cash flow comes with a step change in
value recognition for Hess. Momentum from a >20% jump in production in the six
months of the second half of 2017 carries growth through 2018, with Guyana
accelerating for a decade from 2019. At our base case we suggest this leaves Hess
‘discounting’ current strip oil prices at current levels of ~$50 / share.

The table below sets our PO at our target mid cycle multiple of 5.5x EV/DACF; note this
does not include any value for non-producing Guyana resource value that we estimate at
~$6/share.
