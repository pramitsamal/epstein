Zynga (Underperform, $2.70)

Stock view: Live events can improve franchises, but still need new titles

Zynga launched Dawn of Titans end of 4Q, and although it progressed into the top 20
grossing games in the U.S. Apple store, it has fallen out of the top 100 at some points
during the quarter suggesting that its overall revenue contribution has been fairly low.
While this is somewhat disappointing, we think investor expectations for the game are
now at reasonable (lower) levels.

Instead of big new title launches, Zynga has indicated it is focused on strengthening its
current franchises with better engagement and monetization through live events and
new features, and progress in this area is key for the 2017 stock outlook. Zynga Poker
(up roughly 80% y/y YTD) appears to be benefiting from the focus on engagement and
live events with much stronger monetization, which could offset declines in other titles.
Overall, we think it could be hard to get the Street excited on the stock without a strong
future title that could drive more than single digit growth.

Key theme/metric(s): DAUs, and live events impact on DAU trends

After launching 10 new games in 2016, Zynga is focusing more heavily on live events to
drive engagement with in franchises rather than launching additional titles. This should,
if successful, translate into better DAU metrics as consumer engage with a title more
often. With Dawn of Titan likely coming below Street expectations, stronger
engagement will be necessarily for Zynga to drive a stronger DAU base. For the quarter,
we model 17.9mn online game DAUs for 1Q, down slightly q/q, and down 6% y/y.

Biggest issues/risks:
- Dawn of Titans revenues: Zynga spend several years developing the game and lack
of title success could impact sentiment.

- Expense leverage and cost-cutting benefits do not materialize: Zynga plans to
further improve operational efficiency and potentially cut non-profitable franchises,
but this may be hard to do without impacting long term growth opportunities.

- Lack of new releases: Zynga gave no indication of when it will release its next
title leaving current franchises to carry revenue and earnings.

Top data points: Zynga game bookings tracking in-line to slightly below est.
Zynga’s largest revenue generating franchises, Zynga Poker was up significantly in 1Q.
Zynga Poker appears to be benefiting from live events and is tracking up roughly 89%
QTD. Combined slots titles appear a bit more challenged with total revenue down 30%
QTD y/y, in part due to lower monetization on Wizard of Oz slots which is tracking down
in gross gaming rankings. Overall, QTD (January and February} Zynga online game
bookings (ex-ad revenue) is tracking up 7% y/y vs our 1Q est. of bookings up 9% y/y.
