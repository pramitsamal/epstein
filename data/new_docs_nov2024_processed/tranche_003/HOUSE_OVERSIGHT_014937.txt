Estimates vs. Consensus: Mostly inline to the Street

We are slightly above the street on revenue at $189mn vs. $188mn, but in-line on
EBITDA at $20mn. Cost cutting could improve EBITDA and Zynga has restructured some
of its workforce and is focusing on driving more engagement with live events in its
game franchises. For 2017, we are below the Street on revenue at $779mn vs. $805mn,
but above on EBITDA at $101mn vs $99mn.

Zynga is improving profitability while engaging players better with live services but we
remain cautious on the company’s ability to materially grow its audience and still favor
the console gaming group. Zynga should have downside support given roughly $1.50 in
cash and assets and strategic franchise value (we estimate Poker/Slots generates over
$250mn+ in revenue annually}. Our $2.70 PO is based on 11x 2018E EBITDA (which is a
premium to the Mobile gaming peer group due to margin expansion potential}, plus
$1.41/share in cash and assets (building).
