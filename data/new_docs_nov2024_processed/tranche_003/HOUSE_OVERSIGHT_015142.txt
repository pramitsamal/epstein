didn’ ttell Netanyahu that she was just about to perform the same act on
me while | was on the phone with Aim. Anyway, at that point, Monica
found a big old dusty Mason jar under my desk. There was a label on the
side which read, “Property of Ronald Reagan.”

That Mason jar was filled with Teflon, and | have rubbed it on myself
every day since.

| began my talk this morning with an epiphany, and |’ d like to end
with another. This epiphany also occurred while | was watching
television—Larry King Live—and, once again, Paula Jones was the guest. At
One point she said, “I'’ ve never voted in my life.” And | was astounded.
Then she said, “I'’ m so apolitical, it’ s unreal.” And | realized what an
incredibly great country America really is, that somebody who was just a
plain citizen, who was never even /nterested in politics—somebody who
had never even voted for a president—had nearly succeeded in toppling
one.

Well, this has been a catharsis for me. | just want to say once more
how much | appreciate your presence here. And finally | would like to share
with you a little witticism that Hillary came up with last night, an idea for
what my epitaph should be: “Here lies Bill Clinton, but that depends on

what you mean by lies.” Isn't she wonderful?
