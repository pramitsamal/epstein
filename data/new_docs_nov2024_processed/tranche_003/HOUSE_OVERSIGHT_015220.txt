Life Among the Neo-Pagans

In the summer of 1997, | performed at the 17th annual Starwood

Neo-Pagan Festival in Sherman, New York—Amish country on the border
near Ohio and Pennsylvania. This event—a female-oriented celebration of
the sensual and the spiritual—took place on private campgrounds, where
clothing was optional. Many women were bare-breasted, and several men
and women walked around fully naked, a practice known as the “sky
clad” experience.

Instead of camping out, | stayed at a nearby bed-and-breakfast
place. Downstairs in the living room, | asked a woman—falsely assuming
that she was the proprietor—where the key would be left if | came back
late at night.

“|don’ t know,” she replied. “I’ m here for the festival.”
“Oh. In what capacity?”

“I’m in the craft.”

“Which craft?”

“That’ s right,” she said.
