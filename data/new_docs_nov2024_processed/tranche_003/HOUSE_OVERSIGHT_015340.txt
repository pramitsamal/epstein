mention an assistant editor at a conservative magazine who infiltrated a
group of protesters in Washington, D.C., later claiming that his purpose
was “to mock and undermine them in the pages of the American
Spectator, and that he helped incite a riot at the National Air and Space
Museum, getting pepper-sprayed in the process.
Moreover, a document from the Houston FBI revealed their plan
“to engage in sniper attacks” and “kill the leadership” of the Occupy
activists “if deemed necessary.”

The Yippies were essentially countercultural, an amalgam of
radicalized stoned hippies and straight political activists. And, although the
Occupiers are essentially mainstream, their demonization by right-wing
media pundits has been providing a repeat performance of neutralizing a
progressive cause.

Bill O' Reilly called the Occupiers “drug-trafficking crackheads”
and “violent America-hating anarchists.” Sean Hannity said they “sound
like skinhead Nazi psychos.” Ann Coulter referred to them as mobs of

“teenage runaways” and “tattooed, body-—pierced, sunken-chested 19-
year-olds getting in fights with the police for fun.” Glenn Beck warned

that they “will come for you and drag you into the streets and kill you.”
