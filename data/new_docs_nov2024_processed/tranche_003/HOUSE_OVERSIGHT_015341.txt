Andrew Breitbart declared that Occupy Wall Street is “a group of public
masturbating violent freaks.”
And Rush Limbaugh labeled them “dumbed down” and
“propagandized” and asked a rhetorical question reeking with layers of
irony: “Whatever happened to the ' 60s--Question Authority?” At this
point, Limbaugh is like a castrated canine that is still busy humping the

living-room sofa by force of habit.
