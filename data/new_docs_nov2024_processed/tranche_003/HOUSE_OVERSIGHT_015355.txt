You don’ t see many porn sites that feature intercourse with
corpses, and if you do, how do you know they’ re really dead? But, say
what you will about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, you have
to give him credit for signing a bill to forbid necrophilia. Under the new
law, sex with a corpse is now a felony punishable by up to eight years in
prison.

Age is no barrier. The state’ s first attempt to outlaw necrophilia--in
response to a case of a man charged with having sex with the corpse of a
4-year-old girl in Southern California---stalled in a legislative committee,
but the bill was revived after an unsuccessful prosecution of a man who
was found in a San Francisco funeral home, passed out on top of an
elderly woman’ s corpse.

Necrophiliacs have been getting away with it all this time, but
district attorneys will no longer be stymied by the lack of an official ban.
According to Tyler Ochoa, a professor at Santa Clara University of Law who
has studied California cases involving allegations of necrophilia,

“Prosecutors didn’ t have anything to charge these people with other
than breaking and entering. But if they worked in a mortuary in the first

place, prosecutors couldn’ t even charge them with that.”
