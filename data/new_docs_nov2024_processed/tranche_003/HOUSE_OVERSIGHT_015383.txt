She was staying at a house in San Francisco owned by actress
Wynona Rider, whose godfather was Timothy Leary. He had been Anita’ s
role model during the final months of A/s life. “You couldn’ t choose how
and when and with whom you were born,” he said, “but you can take
charge of your own death.” And that’ s exactly what she was now doing.

Robin Williams learned about Anita’ s situation from his co-star in
Good Will Hunting, Matt Damon, who had been told about it by his
girlfriend, Wynona. Robin had never met Anita, but he called and offered
to pay a visit, in keeping with his benign case of Patch Adams Syndrome.
After all, if Patch could travel to Trinidad to entertain murderers who
would be hanged three days later, why shouldn’ t it be appropriate for
Robin to make Anita laugh on Christmas day? She hesitated— “l’ ve
never really been a fan of his work,” she thought—but then invited him to
visit...

And so it came to pass in 2014 that Robin Williams would also
commit suicide. In the midst of mass mourning him, Rush Limbaugh
explained that “Leftists are never happy.” And the anti-choice Lifenews
claimed that Robin killed himself out of guilt over an abortion his girlfriend

had in the 1970s.
