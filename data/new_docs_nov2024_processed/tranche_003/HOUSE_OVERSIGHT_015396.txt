Ram Dass and | went to a health-food restaurant, where we discovered
that we shared something in common: we were all practicing celibacy —
Larry at the suggestion of Dick Gregory, Althea by extension, Ram Dass for
spiritual purposes, and me just for the sheer perversity of it.

When Larry got shot down south by a racist nut because Hust/er had
a black naked model, Althea had transformed the Coca-Cola Suite at
Emory University Hospital into her office, where she was now studying the
Slides of the irreverent “Jesus and the Adulteress” feature. Dick Gregory
was there, and he said, “This scares me He was concerned about
reaction in the Bible Belt, notwithstanding the fact that Hust/er's research
department had already made certain that the text followed the Bible.

And now Althea was checking for any sexism that might have
slipped past the male editors’ limited consciousness. The spread was
already in page forms, but not yet collated into the magazine, and there
was still a gnawing dilemma about whether or not to publish it.

The marketing people were aghast at the possibility that wholesalers
would refuse to distribute an issue of the magazine with such a blatantly
blasphemous feature. Althea and | voted to publish. Gregory and editor
Bruce David voted not to publish. “lI’ m against it,” he said, “because

we're this is an issue that just simply will not be distributed.”
