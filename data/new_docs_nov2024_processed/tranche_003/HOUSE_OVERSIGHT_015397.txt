Faced with this crucial decision, Althea made her choice on the basis
of pure whimsicality. She noticed a pair of pigeons on the window ledge.
One of them was waddling toward the other. “All right,” she said, “if
that dove walks over and pecks the other dove, then we w/// publish this.”
The pigeon continued strutting along the window ledge, but it stopped
short and didn’ t peck the other pigeon, so publication of “Jesus and the
Adulteress” was postponed indefinitely.

Of course, Dick Gregory continued to spread his diligent activism
until he died. He was a loss to me, and to this country, and around the

world, but his powerful inspiration remains.
