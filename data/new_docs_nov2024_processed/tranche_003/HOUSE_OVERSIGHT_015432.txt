study to determine the feasibility of constructing a scientific/military base.

“| was one of the lucky thirteen,” George remembers. “In fact, you
don’ t have to be a rocket scientist to be a rocket scientist. Von Braun told
me that many of his ideas came from science-fiction magazines.

“The project was so secret that the thirteen of us could not even
tell our bosses--they didn’ t have what was called ‘need to know.’ |
would tell [my wife] Judith that | was going to Washington, D.C., and then |
would change planes to go to Huntsville, Alabama, where much of the
work was done. | made up stories about Washington for her, while | really
was in Huntsville, which also was the watercress capital of the world. I’ d
make up a story about the cherry blossoms, or seeing a senator in the
street.

“Unfortunately, when | left the government after nine years (two in
the army), | lost my own security rating and need-to-know, so | had no
idea if the station was ever built on the moon, and | no longer got cheap
watercress.” According to Wikipedia, “The permanent outpost was
predicted to cost $6 billion and become operational in December 1966. A
lunar landing-and-return vehicle would have shuttled up to 16 astronauts
at a time to the base and back. Horizon never progressed past the

feasibility stage in an official capacity.”
