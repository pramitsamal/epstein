Review of Test Data Indicates Conservatism for Tile
Penetration

@ The existing SOFI on tile test data used to create Crater
was reviewed along with STS-87 Southwest Research data
— Crater overpredicted penetration of tile coating
significantly
+ Initial penetration to described by normal velocity
* Varies with volume/mass of projectile (e.g., 200ft/sec for
3cu. In)
+ Significant energy is required for the softer SOFI particle
to penetrate the relatively hard tile coating
* Test results do show that it is possible at sufficient mass
and velocity
* Conversely, once tile is penetrated SOF! can cause
significant damage

* Minor variations in total energy (above penetration level)
can cause significant tile damage

— Flight condition is significantly outside of test database
* Volume of ramp is 1920cu in vs 3 cu in for test

NASA Internal Slide

WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND FROM THE SLIDE?

Some images of the launch are shown on the right

Here is what you should have understood from the slide: tiles are
really tough but if the foam dislodged from the fuel tank broke through
the outer coating it would cause significant damage. The estimated speed
of the foam hitting the tile was 640 times greater than anything previously
tested. Worried?

Is this a proper understanding of the problem? You have the slide
and the images. Take another look and think hard. If you want, you can
check a video of a similar launch on YouTube to get a feel for the scale of
things, but the still frames shown all the information you need to make
your conclusion.
