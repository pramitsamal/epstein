Penrose Steps

Optical Illusions

This picture is an illusion that plays with your stereoscopic synthesis. The
dots appears to flip between black and white. Other illusions play with
depth perception. The Penrose Steps are a type of illusion that tries to
build an impossible physical model in our cerebral cortex. The brain sees
perspective and depth perception cues, but the resulting shape could
never exist.

Hearing
Unlike sight, hearing is an absolute sense. Our ears capture and focus
sound down to the eardrum where a set of small hairs called cilia convert
it into electrical impulses. The impulses stimulate cells corresponding to
specific pitches.

We are born with perfect pitch, yet most of us lose it early on. When
I hear Maria Carey sing a top B flat a specific set of neurons located near
the ear fires, and if she sings a top ‘A then a different clump of neurons
are stimulated. By the time most children come to learn music they have
edited out this absolute pitch information. One group of children who
do not lose the ability are Chinese pianists. Because Chinese is a tonal
language — where the pitch of words affects their meaning — and because
