ach Christmas I buy the Private Eye annual (an English satirical
mens only to be slightly disappointed when much of the

humor falls flat, yet I can watch the TV current affairs quiz “Have I
Got News for You’ featuring its editor and be reduced to tears of laughter.
Being at a live recording of the show is even more powerful. Why is
this? Why is the experience and effect so different? Is it just the sense of
occasion when I go to a live show or is there something more to shared
experience?

We appear to learn more from lectures delivered in person than
reading the lecturer’s book, or even watching the same lecture recorded
on video. Studies show children who are read to by their parents do better
than if they are left to follow along with a CD. Two groups of children
were tested on two made-up words used in a story. The children read to
by their parents had an 80% recall rate, while children who followed the
CD only 17%. This is a big disparity. The simplest explanation is that the
children who were read to pay more attention. Are there other effects?
