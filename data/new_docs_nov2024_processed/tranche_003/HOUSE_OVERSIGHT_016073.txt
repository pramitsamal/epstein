a degree in Physics and Computer Science, so I am no layman. The
modern web gives amateurs like me, easy access to enormous information

libraries even five years ago. Over time I have built up a personal library
of books in the field, many of them ex-library copies which, by their date

I’m always skeptical of the enormous bibliographies found in the
back of science books and whether they are ever read. If you want a
pointer to the next books to read, here are some suggestions: A Brief
History of Time, The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat, The Emperor's
New Mind, The Naked Jape, Gédel Escher Bach, Proust and the Squid,
Logic, A Five Day Course in Thinking, Your Brain on Music, The 4%
Universe, From Eternity to Here and Time.
