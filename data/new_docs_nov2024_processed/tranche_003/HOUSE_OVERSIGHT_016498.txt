ARGUMENT
Despite the Manhattan District Attorney’s apparent opposition to releasing any of portion
of the appellate briefs, good cause exists to unseal briefs with victims’ names redacted because
the handling of Epstein’s designation as a sex offender by New York prosecutors — including the
appellate arguments regarding that designation — are of paramount public concern and should be
open to public scrutiny.

I. THE POST HAS THE RIGHT TO MOVE THIS COURT FOR AN ORDER
UNSEALING THE APPELLATE BRIEFING

As a threshold matter, the Practice Rules of this Court permit non-parties (like the Post)
to submit “[a]pplications for sealing and unsealing documents . .. by motion.” 22 NYCRR
§ 1250.1(e)(3). The Post’s right to petition this Court for an order unsealing the appellate briefs
is further buttressed by the rule that “affected members of the media should be given the
opportunity to be heard” before a Court takes the drastic step of sealing court proceedings, filings
or dockets. In re Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v. Moynihan, 125 A.D.2d 34, 38, 512
N.Y.S.2d 266, 269 (3d Dep’t 1987), aff'd on other grounds, 71 N.Y.2d 263, 525 N.Y.S.2d 24
(1988). See also Mancheski v. Gabelli Grp. Capital Partners, 39 A.D.3d 499, 501, 835
N.Y.S.2d 595, 597 (2d Dep’t 2007) (“[{P]rior to issuance of an order to seal judicial documents,
the court is obligated, where possible, to afford news media an opportunity to be heard.”) (citing
Inre Herald Co. v. Weisenberg, 59 N.Y.2d 378, 383, 465 N.Y.S.2d 862, 864 (1983)); Maxim,
Ine. v. Feifer, 145 A.D.3d 516, 43 N.Y.S.3d 313 (1st Dep’t 2016) (reversing order denying
motion of press entities to intervene for purpose of seeking access to filed motion papers and
other court records).

In addition to guaranteeing the Post’s right to move this Court to unseal documents, New

York law also requires this Court to make “specific findings to support its determination” before
