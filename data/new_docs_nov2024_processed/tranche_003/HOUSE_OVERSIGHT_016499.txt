limiting public access to judicial records or proceedings. Daily News, L.P. v. Wiley, 126 A.D.3d
511, 515, 6 N.Y.S.3d 19, 24 (1st Dep’t 2015) (before sealing records, courts “must adhere

exists for disclosing the appellate briefs because they contain a full explanation for why the
District Attorney’s Office argued before the lower court that Epstein should be registered as a
