Sarah,

We have obtained information about the water supply in NYC as requested. Note that the City of NY
produces about 33 times the amount of water than the City of West Palm Beach. We tried to compile
data that can be comparable. However, NYC act as their own State agency and track different
parameters than the State of Florida. See below for additional information.

Please let know if you want any changes made. NCY produces 1.1 billion mgd per day.

Below is what they say about their treatment process:

Water Treatment

All surface water and groundwater entering New York
City’s distribution system is treated with chlorine, fluoride,
food grade phosphoric acid and, in some cases, sodium
hydroxide. New York City uses chlorine to meet the New
York State Sanitary Code and federal Safe Drinking Water
Act (SDWA) disinfection requirements. Fluoride, at a
concentration of one part per million, is added to help
prevent tooth decay and has been added since 1966 in
accordance with the New York City Health Code. Phosphoric
acid 1s added to create a protective film on pipes that
reduces the release of metals such as lead from household
plumbing. Sodium hydroxide is added to Catskill/Delaware
water to raise the pH and reduce corrosivity.
