rapid development of software without standards of correctness has opened up many
routes to exploit von Neumann architecture’s storage of data and instructions in the same
memory. One of the most common routes, known as “buffer overrun,” involves an input
number (or long string of characters) that is bigger than the programmer expected and
overflows into where the instructions are stored. By carefully designing an input number
that is too big by far, someone using a piece of software can infect it with instructions not
intended by the programmer, and thus change what it does. This is the basis for creating
a computer virus—so named for its similarity to a biological virus. The latter injects
extra DNA into a cell, and that cell’s transcription and translation mechanism blindly
interprets it, making proteins that may be harmful to the host cell. Furthermore, the
replication mechanism for the cell takes care of multiplying the virus. Thus, a small
foreign entity can take control of a much bigger entity and bend its behavior in
unexpected ways.

These and other forms of digital attacks have taken the security of our everyday
lives from us. We rely on computers for almost everything now. We rely on computers
for our infrastructure of electricity, gas, roads, cars, trains, and airplanes; these are all
vulnerable. We rely on computers for our banking, our payment of bills, our retirement
accounts, our mortgages, our purchasing of goods and services—these, too, are all
vulnerable. We rely on computers for our entertainment, our communications both
business and personal, our physical security at home, our information about the world,
and our voting systems—all vulnerable. None of this will get fixed anytime soon. In the
meantime, many aspects of our society are open to vicious attacks, whether by
freelancing criminals or nation-state adversaries.

The second development is that computation has gone beyond simply computing
functions. Instead, programs remain online continuously, and so they can gather data
about a sequence of queries. Under the Wiener/Turing/von Neumann scheme, we might
think of the communication pattern for a Web browser to be:

User: Give me Web page A.
Browser: Here is Web page A.

User: Give me Web page B.
Browser: Here is Web page B.

Now instead it can look like this:

User: Give me Web page A.
Browser: Here is Web page A. [And I will secretly
remember that you asked for Web page A.]

User: Give me Web page B.

Browser: Here is Web page B. [I see a correlation between
its contents and that of the earlier requested Web page A, so Iwill
update my model of you, the user, and transmit it to the company
that produced me. ]
