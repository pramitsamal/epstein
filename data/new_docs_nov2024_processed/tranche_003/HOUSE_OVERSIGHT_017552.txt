TODD OLDHAM

Todd is a well-known designer whose career spans more
than 20 years. Distinguished as an innovator of accessible
design, Todd Oldham is the founder of Todd Oldham Studio,
a multifaceted, full-service design studio based in NYC.
Originally a New York fashion designer, the host
of “Todd Time” on MTV’s House of Style, Todd’s career has
evolved to include all areas of design, from interior design,
film and photography, to furniture and graphic design.
Todd is currently working on his 19th book Charley
Harper’s Animal Kingdom. His previous books include a 672-
page monograph on the life’s work of artist Alexander Girard; a
unique ongoing series called Place Space that explores singular
places and the uncommonly devoted people that create them;
an artist’s monograph on the brilliant, warped work of Wayne
White (all published by AMMO BOOKS). Most recently, Kid
Made Modern, a collection of art supplies and kits, books
and events, debuted this summer in all Target locations.
