advise the victim about any plea negotiations. 734 Interestingly, however, the Hawaii legislature defined major developments
as arrest or release of the suspect by the police, case deferral by the police, referral to the prosecutor by the police, rejection of
the case by the prosecutor, preliminary hearing date, grand jury date, trial and sentencing dates, and the disposition of the case.
234 The usage of the term case and the plain language of the provisions demonstrate that victims in the State of Hawaii are
entitled to a notification right and a possible consultation right long before formal charges are filed.

[*100] Other states also expressly extend rights before the filing of charges. Colorado guarantees rights at all critical stages
of the criminal justice process[,] which includes both the filing of charges and the decision to not file charges. 73° In Missouri,
victims have the right:

on charged cases or submitted cases where no charge decision has yet been made, to be informed by the prosecuting attorney of
the status of the case and of the availability [of different forms of compensation and assistance] and of any final decision by the
prosecuting attorney not to file charges. 77°

In New Jersey, officials typically send a letter informing the victim that the case has been referred to the prosecutors' office
and explains and offers the services available from the country office of victim-witness advocacy. 737 Subsequent letters to

the victim ensure that the victim has notice of a series of decisions long before indictment, 73%

and the office actively solicits
information in order to help the prosecutor's office decide whether or not to prosecute a case. 73? Along a similar vein, the
Massachusetts legislature included a provision that makes it clear that nothing should prevent a prosecutor from providing
victim services to persons injured by the commission of a crime, even though a complaint or indictment has not yet been
issued, 24°

In addition to extending rights before the filing of charges, several states require consultation before the prosecutor reaches a
plea agreement with the defendant. For example, Idaho's statute provides that a victim must be given an opportunity to
communicate with the prosecution in criminal or juvenile offenses, and be advised of any proposed plea agreement by the
prosecuting attorney prior to entering into a plea agreement in criminal or juvenile offenses involving crimes of violence, sex
