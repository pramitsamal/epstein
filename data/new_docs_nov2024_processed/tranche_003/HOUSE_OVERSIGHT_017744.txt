2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *885

the duty of the trial court [in considering whether to approve a jury trial waiver] is not to be discharged as a mere matter of rote,
but with sound and advised discretion, with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or from
any of the essential elements thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity. 716

This is a serious and weighty responsibility. 7!9

[*886] To discharge that serious and weighty responsibility, the trial court should receive as much information as possible.
The victim is often well situated to provide information about how the public will view a non-jury trial. The proposed rule
change takes the modest step of requiring the court to hear the victim before approving any non-jury trial, a step that is
consistent with the CVRA's command that victims be treated with fairness.

Importantly, this change would not interfere with defendants’ rights. The Supreme Court has squarely held that the defendant
lacks any constitutional right to unilaterally elect a bench trial. 72° Of course, in some circumstances, despite a victim's
objection, a non-jury trial nonetheless will be appropriate. Moreover, in extreme cases, the defendant may have a right to a non-
jury trial where pretrial publicity has pervasively tainted the jury pool. 72! Nothing in the proposed rule change would interfere
with a court's right to approve a bench trial in such circumstances, so long as the court considers the victim's perspective as part
of the approval process.

Rule 32(a) - Deleting Old Definition of Victim

The Proposal:

The definition of victim currently contained in Rule 32 should be stricken as follows:
Rule 32. Sentencing and Judgment

(a) Definitions. The following definitions apply under this rule:

(1) Crime of violence or sexual abuse means:

(A) a crime that involves the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another's person or property; or

(B) a crime under /8 U.S.C. 2241-2248 or 2251-2257.
[*887]

(2) Victim means an individual against whom the defendant committed an offense for which the court will impose sentence.
The Rationale:

The old definition of victim in Rule 32 is now too narrow, as it is limited to crimes of violence or sexual abuse. The CVRA, in
contrast, includes all victims within its protections. In the proposed new rules, victim would be defined in Rule 1. 77?
Accordingly, the narrower definition found here can simply be eliminated. The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules is well
