Rule 32(c)(1)(B) - Presentence Report Considering Restitution in All Cases
The Proposal:

Rule 32(c)(1)(B) should be amended to require that the presentence report contain restitution information in all cases as
follows:

(c) Presentence Investigation.
(1) Required Investigation.

(A) In General. The probation officer must conduct a presentence investigation and submit a report to the court before it
imposes sentence unless:

(i) /8 U.S.C. 3593(c) or another statute requires otherwise; or

(i1) the court finds that the information in the record enables it to meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under /8 U.S.C.
3553, and the court explains its finding on the record.
[*888]

(B) Restitution. If the law requires permits restitution, the probation officer must conduct an investigation and submit a report
that contains sufficient information for the court to order restitution.

The Rationale:

As currently written, the rule directs that a presentence report contain information about restitution only when the law
requires restitution. The proposed amendment directs that all presentence reports contain appropriate restitution information
whenever the law permits restitution. If the law permits restitution, the court ought to receive information sufficient to allow
it to determine whether to order such restitution. Only with such knowledge can the court appropriately exercise its discretion.

In most cases, restitution is covered by one of two federal statutes: the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA),
224 and its predecessor, the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA). 7%° For all crimes of violence and certain
crimes against property, the MVRA firmly directs that notwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a

defendant convicted of [certain offenses such as crimes of violence] ... the court shall order ... that the defendant make
restitution to the victim of the offense or, if the victim is deceased, to the victim's estate. 226 For other crimes, the earlier
22)

VWPA controls. It permits the court to order restitution in its discretion after considering various relevant factors.
