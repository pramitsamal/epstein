to full and timely restitution as provided in law. 7°? As a practical matter, many of the calculations supporting a restitution
award will rest on information in the presentence report. While the restitution statutes have their own detailed procedural

provisions, 7°4

the presentence report is clearly a central part of the restitution process. If a presentence report fails to
accurately recount restitution figures, crime victims may be short-changed. For all these reasons, the CVRA should be
understood as giving victims the right to review relevant parts of the presentence report and to be heard before a court makes
any final conclusions about Guidelines calculations and other sentencing issues. Many states follow a similar approach and
give victims access to the presentence report. 7>°

In February 2005, I testified before the Sentencing Commission to recommend a change in the U.S. Sentencing Commission
Guidelines Manual along the lines of the proposals contained in this [*897] Article. *°° In particular, I suggested that the
Commission change its current rule, which allows only the parties to see the presentence report. 7°’ The Practitioners’

Advisory Group to the Sentencing Commission later disputed my proposal. In a letter to the Commission, 7*8

they argued that
nothing in the CVRA or its legislative history states that crime victims should be permitted to review portions of the
presentence report, dispute guidelines calculations, raise grounds for departure, or, as such rights would seem to imply, appeal a
sentence on factual or legal grounds. 7°? The Practitioners’ Group also cited the drafting history of the proposed constitutional
amendment protecting victims’ rights, which they thought was limited to giving a victim merely the right to allocute at
sentencing - that is, merely to provide victim impact information. 7°°

The Practitioners' Group's arguments are flawed for several reasons. First, the Group too narrowly views the relevant legislative
history of the CVRA. As explained above, Congress intended for victims to have broad rights in the sentencing process,
including rights to be reasonably heard in a meaningful manner. 7°! It is not reasonable to deprive victims of the critical
information in the presentence report. Second, the Practioners' Group inaccurately describes the relevant history of the Victims’
Rights Amendment. It is true that the proposed constitutional amendment contained a right to be reasonably heard, just as the
CVRA does. However, the Practitioner's Group fails to recognize that the legislative history of the amendment suggests that
