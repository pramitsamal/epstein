Another person who went to the island with Epstein, Maxwell, and several beautiful women
remembers that the women “sat around one night teasing him about the kinds of grasping women
who might want to date him. He was amused by the idea.... He’s like a king in his own world.”

Many people comment there is something innocent, almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein. They
see this as refreshing, given the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan Dershowitz says that, as
he was getting to know Epstein, his wife asked him if he would still be close to him if Epstein
suddenly filed for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied, “Absolutely. I would be as interested
in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his
ideas.”
