CHAPTER 7

Mary: March 2005

f there’s no traffic, Mary’s hometown is less than thirty min-
utes away from the island of Palm Beach. But in economic

terms it’s a world away. Her high school is run by the county.
Most of Mary’s classmates are black. Thirty percent are Hispanic,
as she is. The rest are white. The school has a C rating, and lots
of students receive free or discounted lunches. Mary is one of
those students. But inch by inch, she’s working her way out of
the crab barrel. A good kid, her teachers think. A kid with a
future in front of her.

Weeks have gone by since her meeting with Epstein. She
hasn't told anyone about the visit. Still, other kids at the high
school have noticed a change.

“Yo, Mary,” a friend says. “What's up with you anyway?”

This is a kid who veers from nice to mean, depending on

who else is around.
