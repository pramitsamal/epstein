CHAPTER 16
The Question of When

The NSA was actually concerned back in the time of the crypto-
wars with improving American security. Nowadays, we see that
their priority is weakening our security.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2015

N HIS 1974 NOVEL, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, John Le Carré

helped establish the concept in the public imagination of a mole
burrowing into a rival intelligence service. Le Carré’s now-classic
mole, code-named Gerald by the KGB, managed in the novel to gain
access to the inner sanctum of the British intelligence service MI6.
Aided and guided by his controllers in Moscow, he systematically
stole British intelligence secrets. As Le Carré wove the plot, the bril-
liantly orchestrated operation involved spotting, compromising, and
recruiting others to gradually advance Gerald the mole to a position
of power. Such well-organized penetrations are not limited to fiction.
The career of the KGB mole Heinz Felfe, who was advanced through
the ranks of West German intelligence by an elaborate series of sac-
rifices by his controllers in Moscow until he actually headed West
German counterintelligence in 1961, could have served as the non-
fiction inspiration for Le Carré’s 1963 novel, The Spy Who Came
in from the Cold. As U.S. intelligence only found out after the Cold
War ended, the KGB also had the ability to sustain moles for decades.
