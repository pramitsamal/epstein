207

While Kucherena did not arrange an interview with Snowden, as I had hoped, he did
something I considered more important. He confirmed the accuracy of his September 2013c
assertion that Snowden had brought secret material to Russia; material he had not given to
journalists in Hong Kong. After what I learned from Cherkashin about the lengths that Russian
intelligence would go to obtain U.S. communications intelligence secrets, I viewed Snowden’s
access to this material to be a crucially important part of the mystery.

As for Snowden, I would send my questions to Ben Wizner and, if he and Snowden approved
them, I would fly back to Moscow. But I decided that I was not going to send money to
Kucherena— or to Snowden.
