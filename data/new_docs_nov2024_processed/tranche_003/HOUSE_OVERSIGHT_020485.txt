e Communicate regularly with federal agencies like the FBI whenever doubts arise
about a cooperative proposal or the Chinese institutions promoting it. Pay attention
to who is on Chinese delegations. Get name lists beforehand and do due diligence

on them.

Promote Reciprocity

Sub-national governments should:

e Follow the money, and the power. In any cooperative venture, US local
governments should determine exactly where Chinese investments originate and
know which Beijing ministry has final decision-making authority related to the
project. They should also check lists of funders and organizations against lists of

known United Front agencies and registered foreign agents.

e Not treat other stakeholders—other countries, Taiwan, or companies—in a

prejudiced manner to win favor in Beijing.

interests, but it does not direct the activities of American local governments and NGOs that do most of the
work of engagement.
