LIFE photographer Robert Capa captured this dramatic image on 6 June, 1944 — during the D-Day invasion. The man in
the photo is Private First Class Huston Riley, a 22-year-old soldier who was shot multiple times. The photographer and a
fellow sergeant helped the wounded soldier who later recalled thinking “What the hell is this guy doing here? I can’t
believe it. Here’s a cameraman on the shore.” Robert spent over an hour taking photographs as men around him died.
Sadly, only one roll of the film survived but the grainy photos were enough to portray the gut-wrenching atmosphere of
that day.
