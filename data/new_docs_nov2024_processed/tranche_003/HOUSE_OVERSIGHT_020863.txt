Perspective —

USA Entitlement Spending = India’s GDP

¢ With a population of 1.2 billion (vs. USA’s 310 million) and
2010 GDP growth of 10% (vs. USA’s 3%), India is a well-
recognized emerging country on the global stage.

¢ It’s notable that India’s 2010 nominal GDP* of $1.43
trillion was equal to USA’s $1.43 trillion in federal
government spending on Social Security, Medicare, and
Medicaid.

Note: *Nominal GDP is not adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). Population and GDP data per IMF.
