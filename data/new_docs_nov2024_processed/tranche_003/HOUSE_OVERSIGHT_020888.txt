Next, We Drill Down on Entitlement Programs...

¢ We begin with the programs with the least sound
financials (Medicaid and Medicare) and end with the
programs with the most sound financials
(Unemployment Insurance and Social Security), as of
today.

¢ We then move to a drilldown of rising healthcare costs
after the Medicaid and Medicare drilldowns.
