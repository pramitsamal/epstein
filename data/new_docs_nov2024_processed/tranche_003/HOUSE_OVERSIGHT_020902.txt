Unemployment Benefits: Long-Term Break-Even,

Though Prone to Cyclicality

Social Insurance Program — Created in 1935 as part of the Social Security Act
to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible workers who are
unemployed through no fault of their own (via layoffs or natural disasters).

e Funded via Taxing Employers — Employers pay federal government 0.8% of
payroll (in addition to various levels of state unemployment insurance taxes) to
fund the Federal Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.

e Funding = Pro-Cyclical — Rising employment increases revenue and reduces
benefit payments, generally leading to surpluses, while falling employment
reduces revenue and increases benefits payments, leading to periodically large
deficits during recessions.

Flexible at the State Level by Design — State governments set policies on
unemployment benefit eligibility / duration / tax levels, while federal government
provide financial and legal oversight.

Generally Break-Even — In 29 of the past 49 years, Federal unemployment
insurance programs have had surpluses. Excluding the 2009 / 2010 loss,
unemployment insurance had a cumulative surplus of $53 billion from 1962 to
2008.
