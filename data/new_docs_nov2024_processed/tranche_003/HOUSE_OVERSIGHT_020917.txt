Debt Level: In the Past, Social Security’s Surpluses Have Masked
USA Inc.’s True Borrowing Needs by $1.4T

e Social Security tax receipts exceeded outlays in every year between 1984 and 2008,
leading to a cumulative surplus of $1.4 trillion.

e These surpluses have been used to fund other parts of federal government operations
(including Medicaid, infrastructure and defense...) under the unified budget accounting
rules.

Without these past Social Security surpluses, USA Inc. would have to have issued $1.4
trillion more debt (or 16% higher than current level of debt) to fund its operations.
