Local Outsourcing/Consolidation: Improve Efficiency of Public Services
Through Automation / Scale / Flexibility

1. Automation — Government agencies cannot afford to perform manual
routine-based processes that can be replaced more efficiently by
technology.

2. Scale — Consolidation of non-core processes across agencies or
outsource non-core processes to local companies can deliver scale
efficiencies.

3. Flexibility — Outsourced labor enables temporary employment in
situations where hiring full-time workers would be costly and
unnecessary.
