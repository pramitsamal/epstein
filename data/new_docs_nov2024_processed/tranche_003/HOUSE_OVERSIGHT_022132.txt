It was an odd thing, Epstein’s association with this self-professed
PhD who, on closer inspection, turned out to be a bit of a grifter.
But the Mindshift conference that Epstein and Seckel hosted
in the Virgin Islands did take place, in 2010. Murray Gell-
Mann was there, along with Leonard Mlodinow, a physicist who
coauthored books with Stephen Hawking. Gerald Sussman, an
expert on artificial intelligence who taught at MIT and also
attended the conference, said that he didn’t remember too much
about it.

“We had scientific discussions, talked about various things,”
he said vaguely.

When Mark Oppenheimer asked him if he’d given money to
Seckel, Sussman “got testy” with the reporter.

“I have had some dealings with him,” Sussman said. “I don't
want to say what it’s about, because I don’t feel good about
it, okay?”
