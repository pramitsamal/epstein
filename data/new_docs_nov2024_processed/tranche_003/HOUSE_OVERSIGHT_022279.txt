Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

IL, Authority

Section 6 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 156,
provides that ‘“The Board shall have
authority from time to time to make,
amend, and rescind, in the manner
prescribed by the Administrative
Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. 553], such rules
and regulations as may be necessary to
carry out the provisions of this Act.’’ As
discussed in detail below, the Board
interprets Section 6 as authorizing the
rule.

A. The Board’s Section 6 Rulemaking
Authority

Numerous comments dispute the
Board’s statutory authority to enact the
proposed rule. Many note the fact that
the Board’s rulemaking is constrained
by Congressional intent as evidenced in
its enabling statute. For instance, the
American Trucking Association quotes a
Ninth Circuit case explaining that
Section 6 ‘‘does not authorize the Board
to promulgate rules and regulations
which have the effect of enlarging its
authority beyond the scope intended by
Congress,’ 11 and similarly, the Motor &
Equipment Manufacturers Association
asserts, “A regulation cannot stand if it
is contrary to the statute.’’12 The Board
agrees that it may not exercise its
rulemaking authority in a way contrary
to that intended by Congress, but for the
reasons discussed below it also does not
believe that it has done so in this rule.

Several comments assert that because
NLRA Section 6 is written in general,
rather than specific, terms, the Board is
not empowered to enact the proposed
rule. For example, Associated Builders
and Contractors argues that “the lack of
express statutory language under
Section 6 of the NLRA to require the
posting of a notice of any kind ‘is a
strong indicator, if not dispositive, that
the Board lacks the authority to impose
such a requirement * * *.’’?18 And the
Heritage Foundation likewise argues
that the Board’s reliance upon its
general Section 6 rulemaking authority
does not suffice to meet the
Administrative Procedure Act’s
requirement that the NPRM must

(1965).

12 Citing United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642,
673 (1997). However, the Supreme Court actually
held there that an agency’s interpretation of its
enabling statute must be given ‘‘controlling weight
unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly
contrary to the statute.” (quoting Chevron U.S.A.
Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,
844 (1984)). There, the Court upheld the rule and
found it was not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly
contrary to the statute.

“reference the legal authority under
which the rule is proposed.” 14

The Board believes that these
comments are in error because the
courts’ construction of other statutes’
general rulemaking authority, as well as
Section 6 in particular, fully support its
reading of this statutory provision. In
fact, earlier this year, the Supreme Court
issued a decision in Mayo Foundation
for Medical Education and Research v.
United States 1° (discussed more fully
below), unanimously reaffirming the
principle that a general grant of
rulemaking authority fully suffices to
confer legislative (or binding)
rulemaking authority upon an agency.

Even prior to Mayo, a long line of both
non-NLRA and NLRA cases supported
reading Section 6 in the manner
suggested by the Board. Over forty years
ago, in Thorpe v. Housing Authority,'®
the Supreme Court found that the
expansive grant of rulemaking authority
in Section 8 of the Housing Act was
sufficient to grant legislative rulemaking
power to the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. The Court
further noted that “[s]uch broad rule-
making powers have been granted to
numerous other federal administrative
bodies in substantially the same
language.’ 17 A few years later, in
Mourning v. Family Publication
Services,1® the Court reaffirmed its
stance in Thorpe:

Where the empowering provision of a
statute states simply that the agency may
‘make * * * such rules and regulations as
may be necessary to carry out the provisions
of this Act,’ we have held that the validity
of a regulation promulgated thereunder will
be sustained so long as it is ‘reasonably
related to the purposes of the enabling
legislation.’ 19

Following the Supreme Court’s lead,
key circuit decisions then extended the

14 See 5 USC 553(b)(2). For this conclusion, the
Heritage Foundation cites Global Van Lines, Inc., v.
ICC, 714 F.2d 1290, 1297-98 (5th Cir. 1983). But
Global Van Lines did not find that a general
statement of authority can never meet the APA’s
requirements to specify the legal authority for the
rule. Instead, the Fifth Circuit held that that portion
of the APA is violated when an agency chooses to
rely on additional statutory provisions in support
of its rule for the first time on appeal, and those
grounds do not appear elsewhere in the
administrative record. See id. at 1298-99. Here, in
contrast, the grounds for the Board’s rule are clearly
laid out in subsection B, Statutory Authority,
below.

rulemaking grant there at issue provided that HUD
may, “from time to time * * * make, amend, and
rescind such rules and regulations as may be
necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act,”

notion that broad grants of rulemaking
authority conveyed legislative
rulemaking power.?° Although the
Board had historically chosen to make
policy by adjudications, the Supreme
Court, consistent with the non-NLRA
case law, used a pair of Board
enforcement cases to unanimously
emphasize the existence of the Board’s
legislative rulemaking authority, NLRB
v. Wyman-Gordon Co.2! and NLEB v.
Bell Aerospace.22

In 1991, after the Board enacted a rule
involving health care units, the
Supreme Court unanimously upheld
that rule in American Hospital
Association v. NLRB.?* The Supreme
Court found that that the general grant
of rulemaking authority contained in
Section 6 of the Act “‘was
unquestionably sufficient to authorize
the rule at issue in this case unless
limited by some other provision in the
Act.” 24 As in AHA, there is no such
limitation here on the Board’s authority
to enact the proposed Rule, as explained
further below. As Senator Tom Harkin
and Representative George Miller 25
emphasized in their comment, the
Supreme Court in AHA examined “the
structure and the policy of the NLRA,”
in order to conclude:

As a matter of statutory drafting, if
Congress had intended to curtail in a
particular area the broad rulemaking
authority granted in § 6, we would have
expected it to do so in language expressly
describing an exception from that section or
at least referring specifically to the section.?°

Thus, the Court could not have been
clearer that unless the Board is
“expressly” limited in some manner,
Section 6 empowers the Board to make
“such rules and regulations as may be
necessary to carry out the provisions of
this Act.” This point was underscored

enactment of the Federal Trade Commission Act of
1914, sufficed to grant the FTC substantive
rulemaking authority).
