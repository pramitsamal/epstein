On August 12, 2011, the final rules for SEC’s
Whistleblower Program became effective. These rules set
forth the requirements for whistleblowers to be eligible for
awards consideration, the factors that SEC will use to deter-
mine the amount of the award, the categories of individuals
who are excluded from award consideration, and the cate-
gories of individuals who are subject to limitations in award
considerations. The final rules strengthen incentives for
employees to report the suspected violations internally
through internal compliance programs when appropriate,
although it does not require an employee to do so in order
to qualify for an award.”

Individuals with information about a possible viola-
tion of the federal securities laws, including FCPA viola-
tions, should submit that information to SEC either online
through SEC’s Tips, Complaints, and Referrals (TCR)
Intake and Resolution System (available at hteps://dene-
bleo.sec.gov/TCRExternal/disclaimer.xhtml) or by mail-
ing or faxing a completed Form TCR to the Commission's
Office of the Whistleblower.

Whistleblowers can submit information anony-
mously. To be considered under SEC’s whistleblower pro-
gram as eligible for a reward, however, the information
must be submitted on an anonymous whistle blower’s behalf

by an attorney.”

Whether or not a whistleblower reports
anonymously, SEC is committed to protecting the identity
of a whistleblower to the fullest extent possible under the
statute.” SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower administers
SEC’s Whistleblower Program and answers questions from
the public regarding the program. Additional informa-
tion regarding SEC’s Whistleblower Program, including

answers to frequently asked questions, is available online at
