the General Services Administration, may also consider a company’s
compliance program when deciding whether to debar or suspend

a contractor Specifically, the relevant regulations provide that the
debarment authority should consider “[w]hether the contractor had
effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at
the time of the activity which constitutes cause for debarment or had
adopted such procedures prior to any Government investigation of the
activity cited as a cause for debarment,’ and “[w]hether the contractor
has instituted or agreed to institute new or revised review and control
procedures and ethics training programs.’ 48 C.ER. § 9.406-1(a).

33 USAM § 9-28.300. When evaluating the pervasiveness of wrongdoing
within the corporation, prosecutors are advised that while it may be
appropriate to charge a corporation for minor misconduct where the
wrongdoing was pervasive, “it may not be appropriate to impose liability
upon a corporation, particularly one with a robust compliance program in
place, under a strict respondeat superior theory for the single isolated act
of a rogue employee.” /d. § 9-28.500.A (emphasis added), Prosecutors
should also consider a company’s compliance program when examining
any remedial actions taken, including efforts to implement an effective
compliance program or to improve an existing one. As the commentary
explains, “although the inadequacy ofa corporate compliance program is
a factor to consider when deciding whether to charge a corporation, that
corporation’s quick recognition of the flaws in the program and its efforts
to improve the program are also factors to consider as to appropriate
disposition ofa case.” Id. § 9-28.900.B. Finally, the Principles of Federal
Prosecution of Business Organizations provides that prosecutors should
consider the existence and effectiveness of the corporation's pre-existing
compliance program in determining how to treat a corporate target. Td.
§ 9-28.800.

319 This is also reflected in the Sentencing Guidelines, which recognizes
that no single, formulaic set of requirements should be imposed, but
instead focuses on a number of factors like applicable industry practice
or the standards called for by any applicable governmental regulation,
the size of the organization, and whether the organization has engaged
in similar misconduct in the past. See US. SENTENCING GUIDELINES §
8B2.1 & app. note 2 (2011).

311 This was underscored by then-SEC Commissioner Cynthia Glassman
in 2003 ina speech on the SEC’s implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act: “[T Jhe ultimate effectiveness of the new corporate governance rules
will be determined by the ‘tone at the top. Adopting a code of ethics
means little if the company’s chief executive officer or its directors make
clear, by conduct or otherwise, that the code’s provisions do not apply
