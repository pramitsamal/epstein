And when she faces our creator... Google ‘Clinton Body Count” and see the list of people that they are
responsible for having killed... She has so many people that are stupid enough to do her bidding in murder. Do
they now know that murder carries a sentence of HELL in the eyes of God.. That is right they do not believe in
God... They think they are GOD!
