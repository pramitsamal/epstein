repatriating companies—which accounted for 52% of the total repatriated amount—
actually reduced their US workforce and decreased their R&D spending following the
repatriation act. The authors of the NBER study point out that cash is fungible, and
firms were able to bypass the guidelines on how repatriated cash should be used.

Table 7 shows the top 15 repatriating companies following the HIA, and IRS estimates
for the proportion of repatriated cash by industry are in Table 8.

Our data for the S&P 500 similarly suggests that share repurchases saw the biggest
pick-up in terms of cash use from when the HIA was passed in October 2004 through
the end of 2006. Buybacks jumped over 200% over this period, where they went from
12% of operating cash flows to 33% of operating cash flow by the end of 2006.
