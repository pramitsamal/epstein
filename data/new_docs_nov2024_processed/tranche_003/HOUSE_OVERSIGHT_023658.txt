- Rumors are too many and certainly enemies want to create as much rumors as possible among allies.

* Why are the areas under the control of al-Houthi, a more secure and stable like Sanaa than the
legitimacy areas in Taiz and Aden?

- | want the source of your information, and | am skeptical of this thing completely.

* Some reports say that the alliance intelligence reports are ineffective with evidence that Houthi and
Saleh still have weapons stocks?

- We can uproot Houthi and Saleh in just few days, and we can mobilize only the Saudi land forces alone
and in a few days, clear all areas and the remaining 15% under the control of Houthi and Ali Abdullah
Saleh. But the result will be victims in our forces by the thousands, and we will open condolences in
every Saudi city and the second result is the victims of Yemeni civilians in very high and very large losses.
And the time is in our side, the long breath is ours. We have the supply, we have all logistical supplies,
and our morals are high. While the enemy has no supply, no money, and does not have a long breath.
Time is in our favor and we will take advantage of the time that is in our favor for us. If we do not take
advantage of the time that is in our favor, we have served the enemy.

* There are proposals from Ali Saleh. cannot this be a way to isolate Houthi?

- Ali Abdullah Saleh has a very big disagreement with Houthi and we know that he is today under the
control and the custody of Houthi, if he is not under the control of guardianship of Houthi, his position
will be completely different from his position today without a doubt. If Ali Abdullah Saleh left Sanaa to
another area his position will be quite different from his position today. Today, he may be forced to
many of the positions he mentioned.

* He submitted an initiative when his son came at the beginning of the war, but you refused?

- That is true, that we were trying to make a political initiative that would make us avoid the war
and we were opening a discussion line at that time provided that they did not approach Aden,
because if they approached Aden, it would be very difficult to discuss a political solution, and
Houthi was courting in Yemen. Unfortunately, nothing has happened as we hope and we have
been forced into operations.

* Your Highness the Prince, there are forces that are neither belonging to the legitimacy nor the
coupists. Why do not the kingdom open lines with these forces?

- All lines are open whether the forces belong to the legitimacy or force belongs to Ali Abdullah
Saleh, or those who are not belong to both sides. And every day we are attracting more.

* Are the tribes of the northern Yemen concealed neutrality? You met with the tribes how do you see
them today?

- There is no doubt that the enthusiasm was very high among them and all of them are very much
hatred of the Houthi group and want to get rid of them as soon as they can devote to Yemen's
development programs.

* | refer to the subject of Egypt again. The relationships with Egypt were excellent. Then the Egyptian
media began to suggest that the relations were almost broken, what is happening?
