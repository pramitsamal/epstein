How Not to Teach 177

Rule #3: Teach practice first, theory and facts second [if you
must teach theory and facts at all]. It is the rare course that starts
with, let’s build this now. Courses that start like that usually hold the
students’ interest, however.

Now let’s move on to the next mistake.

Mistake #4: Thinking that students are not worried about the
purpose of what they are being taught

When students ask what use algebra will be to them, they are told
they will need it later. They are told this about any number of subjects
that they are forced to learn in high school. The problem is that sub-
ject-based education is never about the potential use of those subjects.
Those were the subjects at Harvard in 1892; that is the only answer
that is true about why students are being forced to learn them. No one
gives that answer. In fact, very few seem to know that answer.

Students have the right to know why they are learning something.
“You will need it later,” is usually a lie, so we need to stop telling them
that. And, we need to think about what real reasons there are to learn
something. If we cannot find those reasons, we really shouldn’t be
teaching the subject. But, of course, I don’t think we should be teach-
ing subjects at all, so my view on this should come as no surprise.

Rule #4: Don’t teach anything unless you can easily explain the
use of learning it.

Let’s look at the next mistake.

Mistake #5: Thinking that studying can replace repeated practice
as a key learning technique

Practice makes sense. When studying and homework mean prac-
tice, then they are good things. But rarely is that their intent. Unless,
of course, we are talking about practicing test taking, which makes
sense only if good test scores are the goal. I realize that good test scores
are, these days, the goal in our society, as one would expect in any
subject-based education system.

So here is rule #5:
