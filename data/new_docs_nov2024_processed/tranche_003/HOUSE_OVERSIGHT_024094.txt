equity interest is neither a publicly offered security nor a security issued by an investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act, the assets of the ERISA Plan include
not only the equity interest, but also include an undivided interest in the underlying assets of
the entity, unless an exception to this general rule applies.

Exceptions Under the Plan Assets Regulation

The Plan Assets Regulation provides several exceptions to the general rule of plan asset
treatment. Pursuant to one such exception, the assets of certain entities, such as the Fund, will
not be treated as plan assets if the entity is operated as a “venture capital operating company”
within the meaning of the Plan Assets Regulation (“VCOC”). Generally, for an entity to qualify
as a VCOC, at least fifty percent (50%) of its assets (excluding short-term investments made
pending long-term commitments or distribution to investors) valued at cost must be invested in
(a) “operating companies” with respect to which the entity has the direct contractual right to
participate substantially in, or to substantially influence the conduct of, the management of the
operating company and the entity must actually exercise such management rights with respect
to one or more such operating companies in the ordinary course of its business, or (b)
“derivative investments” (as defined in the Plan Assets Regulation) (the “Asset Test”). For the
purposes of qualifying as a VCOC, an “operating company” is defined as an entity that is
primarily engaged, directly or through a majority owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, in the
production or sale of a product or service other than the investment of capital, and includes a
“real estate operating company” as defined in the Plan Assets Regulation (but does not include
another VCOC). Determination as to whether an entity qualifies as a VCOC is made at the time
when the entity makes its first long-term investment (other than short-term investments made
pending long-term commitments) and thereafter during a ninety-day annual valuation period
each year, the first day of which shall begin no later than the anniversary of the entity’s first
long-term investment. In order for an entity to continue to qualify as a VCOC, the entity must
meet the Asset Test on at least one day during each such ninety-day annual valuation period.
Special rules apply to any wind-up of a VCOC when it enters its “distribution period” as
defined in the Plan Assets Regulation.

An additional exception applies when equity participation in the entity by benefit plan
investors is not “significant.” Equity participation in an entity by “benefit plan investors” (as
defined in Section 3(42) of ERISA) is “significant” on any date if, immediately after the most
recent acquisition or disposition of any equity interest in the entity, 25% or more of the value (in
the aggregate) of any class of equity interests in the entity is held by “benefit plan investors.”
For purposes of the 25% test, the term “benefit plan investors” includes ERISA Plans, certain
other retirement plans defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code (such as individual
retirement accounts), and entities or accounts deemed to hold “plan assets” due to an
investment in such entity or account by ERISA Plans or such other retirement plans (such as
insurance company general accounts). For the purposes of calculating the 25% threshold under
the Plan Assets Regulation, the value of any equity interest held by a person (other than a
“benefit plan investor”) who has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of
the entity or that provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such
assets (or an affiliate of such person) is disregarded.

The General Partner will use reasonable best efforts to conduct the affairs and operations of the
Fund in such a manner so that the assets of the Fund will not be treated as “plan assets” of any
