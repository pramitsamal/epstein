o Stemming the flow of illicit bulk cash out of the United States

o Attacking trade-based money laundering at home and abroad

o Promoting transparency in the ownership of legal entities

o Examining anti-money laundering regulatory oversight and enforcement at casinos

o Implementing and enforcing anti-money laundering regulations for the insurance industry
o Supporting global anti-money laundering capacity building and enforcement efforts

o Improving how to measure progress

e International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) — An annual report issued by the U.S. Department
of State that describes the efforts to attack, country by country, all aspects of the international drug trade, as well
as chemical control, money laundering and financial crimes.

e Country Reports on Terrorism — An annual report, previously known as Patterns of Global Terrorism, issued
by the Department of State that provides overviews of terrorist activity in countries in which acts of terrorism
occurred, countries that are state sponsors of terrorism, and countries determined by the U.S. Secretary of State
to be of particular interest in the global war on terror. The Country Reports on Terrorism also cover major
terrorism-related events involving Americans, information on terrorist groups, terrorist sanctuaries, terrorist
attempts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, statistical information provided by the National
Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) on individuals killed, injured or kidnapped by terrorist groups, and bilateral and
multilateral counterterrorism cooperation.
