The Top-Tier Media Stocks have outperformed Speculative Media Stocks over the past three years (for the most
part). Therefore, you should strongly consider the first set of stocks listed above. While it’s entirely possible

they all underperform in 2015 if the market falters, these are elite names that are highly likely to be around for a
long time. Even if the worst occurs, you will have an opportunity to add more to your position at cheaper prices.
