Looking forward, it is really not up to the west, much less the US, to
plan Libya’s transition. It is a relief to see so many articles and
statements reflecting lessons learnt from Iraq. But the Libyans are far
ahead of where the US was when the initial fighting ended in Iraq.
The National Transitional Council has a draft constitutional charter
that is impressive in scope, aspirations and detail — including 37
articles on rights, freedoms and governance arrangements.

The sceptics’ response to all this, of course, is that it is too early to
tell. In a year, or a decade, Libya could disintegrate into tribal
conflict or Islamist insurgency, or split apart or lurch from one
strongman to another. But the question for those who opposed the
intervention is whether any of those things is worse than Col Gaddafi
staying on by increasingly brutal means for many more years.
Instability and worse would follow when he died, even had he
orchestrated a transition.

The sceptics must now admit that the real choice in Libya was
between temporary stability and the illusion of control, or fluidity and
the ability to influence events driven by much larger forces. Welcome
to the tough choices of foreign policy in the 21st century. Libya
proves the west can make those choices wisely after all.
