the secrecy of internal deliberations a hallmark of his time in office,
divulges a number of conflicts with others in the inner circle.

He wrote that George J. Tenet, the director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, resigned in 2004 just “when the going got tough,” a decision
he calls “unfair to the president.” He wrote that he believes that
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell tried to undermine President Bush
by privately expressing doubts about the Iraq war, and he confirms
that he pushed to have Mr. Powell removed from the cabinet after the
2004 election. “It was as though he thought the proper way to express
his views was by criticizing administration policy to people outside
the government,” Mr. Cheney writes. His resignation “was for the
best.”

He faults former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for naiveté in
the efforts to forge anuclear weapons agreement with North Korea,
and Mr. Cheney reports that he fought with White House advisers
over softening the president’s speeches on Iraq.

Mr. Cheney acknowledged that the administration underestimated the
challenges in Iraq, but he said the real blame for the violence was
with the terrorists.

He also defends the Bush administration’s decision to inflict what he
called “toughinterrogations” — like the suffocation technique known
as waterboarding — on captured terrorism suspects, saying it
extracted information that saved lives. He rejects portrayals of such
techniques as “torture.”

In discussing the much-disputed “16 words” about Iraq’s supposed
hunt for uranium in Niger that were included in President Bush’s
2003 State of the Union address to help justify the eventual invasion,
Mr. Cheney said that unlike other aides, he saw no need to apologize
for making that claim. He writes that Ms. Rice eventually came
around to his view.
