Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

Methodology and Estimates: Industry Comparisons

To evaluate our methodology and results, we compare estimated values from our model with values
for the same parameters in markets for certain other stimulants and pharmaceuticals. We believe that
this comparison is useful because cannabis is used recreationally in much the same way alcohol, coffee

and tobacco are used, and because cannabis may be an alternative to pharmaceuticals currently used
to treat a range of medical conditions. The following table compares the estimated penetration rate,

average monthly consumer spending and U.S. retail market size for a number of common stimulants

and pharmaceutical categories.

U.S. retail markets for alcohol, coffee, tobacco, and pharmaceutical painkillers and antidepressants.
