Challenges For Growth

We see several issues that we expect will moderate growth of hemp CBD in years to
come. As a commodity, we see economics diminishing as CBD supply rises with
increased acres along with higher costs for seed from increased seed demand. We also
see a lack of best practices for cultivation, storage restrictions and uncertainty about
the consistency of seeds/clones available increasing the probability that yields are
compromised.
