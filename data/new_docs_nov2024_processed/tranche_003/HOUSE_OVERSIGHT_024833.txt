Synthetic Cannabis (Schenkel)

The Broad Spectrum Of Cannabinoids

Cannabinoids fall into three main types: (1) endogenous cannabinoids, which are
produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals; (2) phytocannabinoids, which
are isolated from plants; and (3) synthetic cannabinoids, which are produced in the
laboratory and may have some structural deviations from the naturally occurring
molecules.

Of the three types, phytocannabinoids have garnered a lot of interest because of their
therapeutic and recreational potential. For example, Marinol and Syndros, which the
FDA cleared for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients,
include the active ingredient dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) which is considered the psychoactive component of marijuana. In June 2048, the
FDA approved an oral formulation of cannabidiol (CBD), Epidiolex, which GW
Pharmaceuticals PLC developed for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare
and severe forms of epilepsy in children.

n addition to THC and CBD, more than 100 other phytocannabinoids have been
identified from the cannabis plant. This includes lesser-known compounds such as
tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabichromene (CBC).

The broad spectrum of phytocannabinoids can bind to a range of different receptors in
the human body and induce a wide variety of pharmacological responses. However, due
to the limited research into these varying effects, a full understanding of the role of each
cannabinoid compound is still poorly understood. With that said, some of the most
studied roles are listed in the table below.
