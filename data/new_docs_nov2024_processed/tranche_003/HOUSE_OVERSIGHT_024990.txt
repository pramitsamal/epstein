herself shies away from the Cineplex imagery in favor of the notion
of “smart power.”

“Smart power’ is the use of American power in ways that would help
prevent and resolve conflict—not just send our military in,” she says.
“Smart power’ is closer cooperation between our development
experts, our diplomats, our military leaders.” Hillary offers an
example: in Afghanistan, the Pentagon has a fund that allows a young
American officer to take $100,000 in discretionary funds and rebuild
a school on his own authority. By contrast, a diplomat or
development expert trying to rebuild a school would spend months
filling out forms, Hillary says, and probably still wouldn’t get the
money out of Congress. “We need a more agile civilian power,” she
concludes.

Hillary draws a distinction between focusing on relations with
governments (the locus of diplomacy for hundreds of years) and
stimulating change in societies, where the results are less controllable
but ultimately more profound. She clearly wants to try both at once,
but that intention can break down under the stress of a crisis. In the
debate over the bombing of Libya, the “society” policymakers were
the hawks. Their argument was caricatured by critics as purely
humanitarian but was in fact strategic. The thinking here was that the
U.S. must “get on the right side of history” and connect to the
aspirations of young people in the region. By contrast, the Old Guard
focused on nervous allies like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Jordan.
Seeing the upheaval through the lens of stability, they were doves on
the question of bombing Libya, which they thought might detract
from the larger aim of containing Iran. Their mantra was “Beware
unintended consequences.”

While the Pentagon was clearly opposed beforehand, the other power
centers in the government were more conflicted. It wasn’t State
versus White House, much less women versus men or old versus
