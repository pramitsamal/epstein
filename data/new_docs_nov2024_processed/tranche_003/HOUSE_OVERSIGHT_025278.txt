G10 currencies

UBS View

side have been considerably reduced.

¢ The GBP trended higher despite stimulus measures by the Bank of England. The main reason is the need
for diversification out of the EUR and USD and decisive UK policy making. We maintain an overweight
after the strong rebound of economic data in 3Q 2012 which we expect to persist into 2013.

¢ The CAD remains supported by better growth dynamics. However in the short term, around the US
elections and fiscal cliff debate, a setback cannot be ruled out. We also remain underweight in the AUD.

¢ The SNB has shown that it can defend the CHF floor. With EUR tail risk reduced the CHF likely recovers
together with the EUR against most other currencies. Thus we close the CHF underweight.

e We expect stronger policy intervention in Japan to weaken the JPY over the coming months.

4 Positive scenario

& Negative scenario

What we're watching Why it matters

Chinese growth We expect China to land softly and then recover. Should China disappoint with a
hard landing, then risk-unwinding would support USD and JPY vs. risk-taker
currencies. In the base case, a Chinese recovery should support the AUD in the
medium term, but a dip below parity is likely in the short term.

European sovereign The main focus lies on the Spanish application for ESM/ECB support, which would
crisis, ECB policy be EUR positive; a rate cut (not expected) would hurt the EUR. Key date: Nov 8,

ECB meeting

US growth and Fed What will the Fed do once Operation Twist ends at year end? How will the
policy response presidential elections change political power in Washington? Key dates: Nov 6,
US presidential elections; Dec 12, FOMC meeting

FX targets: EURUSD >1.35 / EURJPY 115
¢ The announcement of unlimited QE in the US, as well as a stronger-than-expected acceleration of global
growth or further European integration would be EURUSD positive. EURUSD should trade above 1.35 in

this case. Yen weakness should come as the Bank of Japan intervenes to weakens its currency.
FX targets: EURUSD <1.25 / EURJPY 90
¢ The European growth outlook deteriorates further with continued recession in 2013. The euro could
rapidly fall below 1.25. A European debt-default cascade (possibly triggered by a disorderly Greece euro
exit) is a tail risk for the single currency. Risk aversion would lead to an extended USD and JPY rally.

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

¢ We continue to have a preference for the
GBP and keep the short in the JPY.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e We recommend that investors diversify
from large USD and EUR exposures into
minor currencies. Structural financing
issues weigh on all the major currencies.

e The best diversifiers based on long-term
macroeconomic fundamentals are the
CAD and the SEK. The AUD, NOK and CHF
should only be added at better entry
levels. The GBP also remains attractive.
