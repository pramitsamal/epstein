Emerging market currencies

UBS View See table for current exchange rates and CIO forecasts
e We continue to like emerging market (EM) currencies over a medium term horizon. We think monetary
policies of major central banks will remain loose for longer whereas the easing cycle in several emerging
markets is over. This should support EM currencies relative to major currencies (USD, EUR, and JPY). Long
term investors should therefore diversify into EM currencies using surplus exposure to these currencies.

¢ In Europe, both the Polish zloty (PLN) and the Turkish lira (TRY) have supportive fundamentals in the
long-term and could benefit from inflows into their fixed-income market which offers attractive yield
relative to G4 currencies. Due to structural reasons we remain cautious on the Hungarian forint (HUF).

¢ The South African rand (ZAR) is currently attractively valued, but Investors should be willing and able to
tolerate bouts of volatility due to the current strikes and a cyclical slowdown of the economy.

e In Asia, we like the Korean won (KRW), the Singaporean dollar (SGD) and the Malaysian ringgit (MYR) as
all three countries have a strong economy and should benefit from increasing liquidity and a recovering
Chinese economy.

¢ In Latin America, the Mexican peso (MXN) remains attractively valued, despite its recent rally.

A Positive scenario
¢ Macroeconomic data comes in stronger than expected and contagion risks in Europe subside further. EM
exchange rates could appreciate swiftly against major currencies (USD, EUR, and JPY).

& Negative scenario
¢ Global growth prospects suffer a prolonged deterioration and the European debt crisis intensifies. EM
exchange rates could see a significant, although likely temporary, sell-off across regions.

Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)

> 5% outperformance of EM FX against G4 currencies over a 6-month horizon

> 5% depreciation of EM FX across regions against USD over a 6-month horizon

What we're watching Why it matters

Inflation dynamics
inEM

Inflation dynamics are important to forecast central bank policy rate
decisions. Monetary easing typically weighs on EM currencies, while rate hikes
tend to be supportive. Key policy rate announcement dates: 11 Nov,
Indonesia; Nov 20, Turkey; Nov 22, South Africa; Nov 30, Mexico

European sovereign crisis Setbacks in sentiment will likely lead to bouts of EM currency depreciation,

providing attractive entry points for longer term investors.

Growth Growth in the US, Europe, and China is key for risk sentiment, growth

prospects in EM. Key date: Dec 6, European Central Bank meeting
