In FY 2013, OGIS began looking at several specific issues regarding agency
policies, procedures, and compliance, including FOIA fees and fee waivers, and the
ways agencies process records related to immigration matters. OGIS also began
a “Preventing Litigation” project, working with agencies on ways to reduce their
chances of a request resulting in litigation.

GAO recommended that OGIS establish a time frame for completing and
implementing a methodology that defines, among other things, the scope,
schedule, criteria, and evaluation questions for reviewing Federal agencies’
FOIA policies, procedures, and compliance. OGIS had already begun creating
a draft assessment framework, which will form one piece of OGIS’s expanded
review methodology.

GAO’s recommendation mirrored that of the National Archives and
Records Administration’s Inspector General (IG), which conducted

a routine review of OGIS in FY 2012 to determine whether OGIS was

adequately established and meets Congress’s intent. The IG report,
completed in September 2012, found that OGIS meets the requirements set

forth in FOIA with regard to both review and dispute resolution. The IG
found that “additional resources could significantly improve OGIS’s ability
to address and meet its mission.”

In response to the GAO recommendations, NARA concurred with both

recommendations and will work to address them in FY 2014.
