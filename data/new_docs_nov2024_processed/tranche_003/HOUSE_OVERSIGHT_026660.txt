Can you imagine the picture of 53 MILLION letters arriving at the White House by January 26th? It will be a mountain.
That image might help deter the Republicans from killing the most substantial improvement to American healthcare since
the discovery of Penicillin.

Do it today! Drop it into a mailbox near you on Monday, January 23rd.
Please send this email to 20 (or more) of your friends, neighbors ann fellow Americans. Ask them to do the same.

This also helps out the US Postal Service, with about $20 Million of stamp sales.

Don’t send emails to Trump...they don’t photograph well.
