RLK: If we look at these, China's
making real progress in intellectual
property, reducing cyber theft —
more needs to be done. Not
requiring tech transfer. The big one,
which they won't change, is
government subsidy for nascent
technologies of the future. Such
government-industry cooperation is
part of the Chinese system — that's
beyond their red line.

RLK: But China should be able to
open their markets — and we
should be able to have a trade
between seriously open markets,
which even Chinese economists say
is good for the Chinese economy
and very good for the world and
American companies — and some
sort of a recognition that China will
continue to subsidize industries.
That's where it will happen, we
hope soon.
