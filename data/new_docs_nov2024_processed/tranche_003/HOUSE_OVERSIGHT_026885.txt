HOST: Yeah. So then if there is
room for a trade deal from an
expert like you, that there's room
for both sides to agree to a deal
that would benefit both the United
States and China. How would you
advise President Trump in terms of
his tactic and how he should
approach China?

RLK: You know, I am not going to

be an expert in advising President
Trump on tactics. I'm not sure he's
amenable to advice and he has his
own style.

RLK: And many people in the US —
let’s put it on the table — who
disagree with Trump on virtually
every other policy — support
Trump either overtly or quietly on
his approach to China. And that's
because there's general recognition
in the US — from Bernie Sanders
Democrats all the way on the left to
the rightwing Republicans all the
way on the right who favor Trump
— that something needs to be done
to alter the US trade relationships,
and the US’ overall relationships,
with China.
