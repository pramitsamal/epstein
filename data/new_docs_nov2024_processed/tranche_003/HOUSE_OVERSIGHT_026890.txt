RLK: There are five real issues
and I do not include the trade
deficit — because, obviously the
trade deficit is complicated. You
have components coming from
other countries that is counted
as part of the trade deficit, but

China gets no benefit from them.

An iPhone for example. Maybe,
China gets 6 or 10 percent of the
cost of roughly $350 for a $1000
retail price. China has also
service purchases that's not
included in the trade deficit,
something like $40 billion per
year — tourists, students.
