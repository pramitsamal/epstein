Anita’s Art Diay

Tuesday 02 November 2010

We made it to Paris for fiac which as usual was a delightfully elegant experience. Paris for the day by
Eurostar is so easy. Everyone was smiling, happy and friendly.

We loved at Mitchell-Innes & Nash William Pope. L’s performance: three world leaders holding a huge-
looking meteorite excreting dye all over them at their own command......

Francis Chantala would not let me look at the Josh Smith paintings he was being most difficult.

There are some strange sights at art fairs: a woman artist dragging around a Louis Vuitton dustbin.
Perhaps she was hoping someone would drop in a nice little unwanted designer package into her bin.

We dropped by to see Jim Lambie in his show in Paris. My amazing designer friend Jean Pierre Tortil,
Elliot Mcdonald and Jim.

Back to London and we visited Wolfe Lenkiewicz at his show The House of the Noble Man. It was a very
lovely show ina lavish £50 million home in Regents Park.

We found on the top floor a lovely work by Matthew Welch called In The Glass Coffin of the Virgin
Forest, the artist was one of Channel 4s New Sensations.
