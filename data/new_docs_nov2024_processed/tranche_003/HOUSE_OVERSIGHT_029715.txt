States would have to return to
Afghanistan two decades later to oust a
Taliban regime that was harboring
terrorists. Before 1990, moreover, no one
predicted that Iraq, having just ended a
bitter eight-year war with Iran, would
swing its battered forces south to invade
Kuwait.

So if it's conventional wisdom that the
United States will not, or should not,
intervene militarily in the Middle East or
South Asia after it draws down forces in
Iraq and Afghanistan, it's also likely dead
wrong. What is true, however, is that
political and military trajectories in the
Middle East and South Asia are likely to
increasingly challenge U.S. contingency
access in the coming decade. The ability
for the United States to surge large-scale
forces into the region, as it did in the
1990 and 2003 wars against Iraq, will
grow increasingly circumscribed. The
United States will have to adapt to this
new strategic landscape by developing
more nimble, highly-mobile, stealthy, and
networked forces, and by abandoning the
traditional practice of slowly and steadily
building up conventional forces at
regional logistic hubs prior to launching
war.
