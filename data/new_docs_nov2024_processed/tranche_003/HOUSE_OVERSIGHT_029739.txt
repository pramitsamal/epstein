procedures; and improving the
transparency and speed of the system for
settling disputes.

Next, the U.S. needs to keep the WTO
current with a vastly changed world
economy. The past WTO agreements are
valuable for all 158 WTO members. But
some economies want to go further by
reducing barriers in important sectors
such as the services trade, environmental
goods and services, government
procurement, and the digital economy.

The services trade, for example, 1s vital
for boosting innovation, productivity and
jobs in developing and developed
countries alike—but regulatory,
licensing, zoning and other barriers to
services are often equivalent to a 30%
tariff or higher. Because liberalization in
the WTO has been stuck, countries have
turned increasingly to bilateral and
multilateral free-trade agreements, some
of which have addressed these newer
topics. The U.S. should foster the WTO
principle of world-wide liberalization by
adopting standards in various industries
and sectors that would be open to all
economies that reciprocate. The WTO
also needs new rules for fair trading by
state-owned enterprises.

Yet the U.S. also should use free-trade
agreements to open markets. Trade
competition advances structural reforms
