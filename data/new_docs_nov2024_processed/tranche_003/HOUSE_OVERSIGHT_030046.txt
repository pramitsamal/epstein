Egypt's new Constitution: an update

Nathan Brown

March 29, 2011 -- The March 19 vote in favor of constitutional
amendments in Egypt provides a boost to the military-led transition
process and its vigorous electoral schedule.

The voter turnout was impressive by Egyptian standards — 41 percent
of eligible voters, at least double the turnout in any previous national
election or referendum — and the victory was overwhelming at 77
percent of voters. But opponents attracted enough votes to make the
outcome seem less like the predictable landslides of the authoritarian
order. Those who objected to the content of the amendments and,
more forcefully, to the process by which they were written and the
political sequence they implied marshaled forceful arguments,
campaigned hard, and then lost.

As a consequence, Egypt’s transition process will likely rush forward.
What are the next steps? The basic sequence of events is clear, but
the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) has not
revealed many of the details. Nor has it shared decision-making
power over the sequence and rules in any serious way.

The amended articles — most of them governing presidential and
parliamentary elections — are now clearly in effect. But the rest of
Egypt’s Constitution remains suspended. Egypt’s military rulers have
suggested that they will very shortly issue a declaration indicating
how authority will be exercised while Egypt’s Parliament and
president are elected, which parts of the 1971 Constitution will be
brought back into effect, and what their own role will be.

The committee that drafted the amendments also prepared
amendments to various laws in order to bring them into conformance
