Hammersmith.

Questions swirl. Who are the Libyan rebels? Who are the angry of
Latakia? The Arab transitions will be long and bumpy — like those
that brought representative government to Latin America and Central
Europe and wide swathes of Asia — but now that fear has been
overcome, they are irreversible.

Here’s who the protesters are: people like Asmaa Mahfouz, 26, the
Egyptian woman who on Jan. 18 made a video urging citizens to go
to Tahrir Square on Jan. 25 — the demonstration that would start the
revolution. She said then: “We’ll go down and demand our rights,
our fundamental human rights. I won’t even talk about any political
rights. We just want our human rights and nothing else.” And she
said people “don’t have to come to Tahrir Square, just go down
anywhere and say it, that we are free human beings.” And: “This is
enough!”

People are being born throughout the Middle East. They are
discovering their capacity to change things, their inner “Basta!”
That’s how the Arab spring began on Dec. 17 in the little town of
Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia — with a fruit peddler’s “enough” to
humiliation. In my end is my beginning.

Three months later the genie is not only out of the bottle, it’s
shattered the bottle. I said of Libya in an earlier column: Be ruthless
or stay out. So now the West is in, be ruthless. Arm the resurgent
rebels. Incapacitate Qaddafi. Do everything short of putting troops on
the ground. Qaddafi, as President Obama has said, “must leave.” So
that Libya can be an Arab country that is imperfect but open.
