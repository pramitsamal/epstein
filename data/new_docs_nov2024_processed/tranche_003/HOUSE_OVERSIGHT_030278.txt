expensive. However, there is a huge discrepancy in the financial
capacities of the two camps. The secular camp can not even dream of
matching the financial resources of the Muslim Brotherhood and the
remnants of the NDP. Finally, much will depend on the ability of the
rivals to win public support by means of clear and succinct electoral
platforms that truly address people's hopes and aspirations.

On the basis of the foregoing criteria and circumstances as they
currently stand, the critical mass is likely to swing towards the
religious camp, with its better organisational, mobilisational and
financial capacities. In addition, even if that camp truly relinquished
the slogan, Islam is the solution, it still possesses a remarkable
talent for swaying public opinion through emotive and misleading
oversimplifications and attacks on the opposing viewpoint. For
example, during the referendum on the constitutional amendments, it
centred its propaganda around Article 2, claiming that a No vote
would negate the Islamic character of the state. Although the
proposed constitutional amendments in the referendum came
nowhere near this article, the tactic worked marvellously, and helped
yield this camp's desired result.

The secularists, therefore, have their work cut out for them. They will
need to expand their base of support considerably and to try to use
the proportional list system to their best advantage. They will also
have to enlist the moral and financial support of the business
community. Finally, they must couch their liberal secularist message
in a simpler and graspable language that will capture the public's
attention. Their ability to rise to this challenge will determine the
future of Egypt, the Egyptian constitution and the nature of its
government. The more effective they are the lower is the probability
that the country's first free and fair parliamentary elections will be its
last.
