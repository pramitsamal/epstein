Also, we plan on running a story this Friday about the Crime Victims' Rights Act suit, and the Jane Does'
proposed remedies. The alleged victims want the U.S. Attorney's Office to rescind the immunity provisions in
the NPA, and to pursue a prosecution against Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators. Can you comment on this?

Thanks so much!
