official circles. The people may be surprised in the future with a new “Sykes-

Picot Agreement”, other “Balfour Declaration” or even other “1967” and we

have lessons in the history of ancestors. The treachery and collusion have been

discovered since 1948 until now make us fear everything and doubt in everything

especially that there are clear signs in the horizon.

Unfortunately, the plotters, in Egypt and other Arab countries, will preach and
promote to such visit and meetings as the savior of the region of its pests. They
will ignore the recent and distance past experiences, depending on the weak Arabic
memory. This matter should be warned in the light of Russian-US conflict on the
dominance in Syria, Saudi-Iranian conflict on the dominance in Yemen, Sunni-
Shute conflict on the dominance in Iraq and Lebanon, and the Israeli presence in
the region. All of these mentioned conflicts are made by the United States.
Accordingly, should we depend on Donald Trump or the new prince of believers

(Caliph)?!

Anyway, I want to remind you that Trump said: “I will get the Gulf states,
who are not doing much, believe me. The Gulf states have nothing but
money. I’m going to get them to pay. We owe 19 trillion, we’re not paying

for it. Don’t forget, without us, the Gulf states won’t exist.”
