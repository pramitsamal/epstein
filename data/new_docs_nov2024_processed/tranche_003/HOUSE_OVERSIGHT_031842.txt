The Awkward Exit of Mideast Envoy
George Mitchell

Daniel Stone

May 13, 2011 -- Two days after Barack Obama's inauguration,
George Mitchell was named special envoy for Middle East peace.
With the new president standing beside Mitchell and Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden took the podium and
extolled Mitchell's reputation and experience having brokered peace
in Northern Ireland, calling him an outstanding public servant with
incredible capacity. In the press, Mitchell was praised as the right
man for the job at the right time.

On Friday, though, that capacity had reached its limit, and Mitchell
told his bosses in the West Wing that he'd had enough. His reasons,
he said, were personal—the kind of nebulous rationale that leaves
ample room for interpretation. Unmentioned were the months of
frustration that Mitchell had built up as direct negotiations between
Israelis and Palestinians became more difficult and the peace process
further off.

The timing of Mitchell's departure couldn't be more awkward. Obama
will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Jordan's King Abdullah next week, as well as deliver a major speech
on Middle East policy. But the resignation didn't come as a surprise
to those who worked closest with Mitchell. A State Department
official described to Newsweek a man increasingly annoyed by both
parties’ constant moving of the goal posts and the constraints of the
administration's unshakeable political instinct to support Israel.
