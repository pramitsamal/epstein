The strain was noticeable in the Middle East. In a recent interview
with Newsweek, one senior Israeli official said Mitchell often would
say one thing about the direction the U.S. was taking with the two
sides, only to be contradicted by Dennis Ross, Clinton's special
adviser to the region. The official, who did not want to be quoted by

Mahmoud Abbas openly accused Mitchell of not doing his job.

he said. At the end we discovered that he didn't convey any of these
ideas to the Israelis. What does it mean?

could sense the increasing difficulty of the job: Administration
officials had been unable to convince Israel to halve new settlements
in the West Bank, alienating Palestinians, and Israelis were irked in
early May when Abbas allied with Hamas, a group that refuses to
