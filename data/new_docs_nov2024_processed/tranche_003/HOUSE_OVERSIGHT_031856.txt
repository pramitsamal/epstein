If the problem continues and escalates further in the Syrian street it is
probable that the prefabricated facility in the Hatay province
constructed to provide temporary lodging to pilgrims during the Hajj
season will not suffice in providing a shelter to Syrian refugees who
thanks to the no-visa regime in travel between Turkey and Syria may
freely escape to Turkey from the trouble in their own street and thus
carry the problem to the Turkish street.

For now the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, terrorists
are abiding with an unilateral truce, which is claimed to have been
negotiated with the government by Abdullah Ocalan, the chieftain of
the gang serving an enforced life term on the Imrali island prison,
which according to claims will last until June 15, three days after the
June 12 parliamentary elections. Indeed, excluding some rehearsal for
a possible mass civilian disobedience campaign after the elections
and some exceptional terrorist acts, it might be said that there is
nothing extraordinary in Turkey’s southeast bordering Syria, Iraq and
Iran, where there are sizeable Kurdish populations.

The “success” of the unrest in Syrian streets in uprooting the
government might mean added trouble for Turkey, which has been
battling with separatist terrorism for the past 25 years. Turkey
remaining silent or supportive of the Assad regime crushing the
pressure for a regime change and reform calls of the Syrian street, on
the other hand, would seriously imperil the regional role aspired by
the AKP governance of Turkey.

Indeed, while the AKP government in Ankara joined the calls of the
U.S.-led coalition of the willing that time is up for Moammar Gadhafi
in Libya and for peace and safety of his own people Gadhafi must
step down, as regards to Syria Ankara, as well as the Western
alliance, has been restraining their calls with a shy request from
Assad to accelerate reforms.
