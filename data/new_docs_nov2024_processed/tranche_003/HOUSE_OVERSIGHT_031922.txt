The matter goes beyond Hamas. The Syrian regime is currently
fighting for its life against its majority Sunni population. It has
survived thus far, but it needs to redefine the conflict. The Iranians
and Hezbollah are among those most concerned with the fall of the
Syrian regime. Syria has been Iran's one significant ally, one
strategically positioned to enhance Iranian influence in the Levant. Its
fall would be a strategic setback for Iran at a time when Tehran is
looking to enhance its position with the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.
Iran, which sees the uprising as engineered by its enemies - the
United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - understandably wants al
Assad to survive.

Meanwhile, the fall of Syria would leave Hezbollah - which is highly
dependent on the current Syrian regime and is in large part an
extension of Syrian policy in Lebanon - wholly dependent on Iran.
And Iran without its Syrian ally is very far away from Hezbollah.
Like Tehran, Hezbollah thus also wants al Assad to survive.
Hezbollah joining Hamas in a confrontation with Israel would take
the focus off the al Assad regime and portray his opponents as
undermining resistance to Israel. Joining a war with Israel also would
make it easier for Hezbollah to weather the fall of al Assad should his
opponents prevail. It would help Hezbollah create a moral foundation
for itself independent of Syria. Hezbollah's ability to force a draw
with Israel in 2006 constituted a victory for the radical Islamist group
that increased its credibility dramatically.

The 2006 military confrontation was also a victory for Damascus, as
it showed the Islamic world that Syria was the only nation-state
supporting effective resistance to Israel. It also showed Israel and the
United States that Syria alone could control Hezbollah and that
forcing Syria out of Lebanon was a strategic error on the part of Israel
and the United States.
