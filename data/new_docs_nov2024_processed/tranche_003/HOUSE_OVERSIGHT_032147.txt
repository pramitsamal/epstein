This six-day journey with Momentum Adventure explores the wild,
stark landscape of the Baja Peninsula, and balances adrenaline-infused
outings with relaxation at the iconic One&Only Palmilla. Navigate a Baja
Challenger racecar through sand washes, cactus forests and lone
beaches; score a hole-in-one at a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course;
and fish for blue marlins in a yacht off the shore. Come evening, sip
tequila in a breezy villa that overlooks the Sea of Cortez.
