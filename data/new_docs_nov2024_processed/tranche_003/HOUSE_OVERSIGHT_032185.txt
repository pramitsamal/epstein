programme Israel should help itself and the international community.
The most potent way would be by improving relations with the
Islamic world, especially the PLO and Turkey. Israel had good
relations with them before. It can do so again.

Fortunately for Israel, and unfortunately for Khamenei, Israel even
has the option to hurt the regime on its very own streets.

That option is the cessation of verbal military threats against Iran.
Cessation of military threats from Israel will make it much harder for
the regime to divert the public's attention away from its falling
popularity and serious domestic problems. Silence from Israel will
make Iran's leaders more worried, as it will rob Khamenei from an
important tool which has helped him, and at a crucial time when the
regime is hemorrhaging legitimacy and popularity at an
unprecedented rate. The damage such an endeavour will cause is
worth the inconvenience of Israeli politicians having to bite their
tongues. Cessation of verbal threats will also prevent significant
future damage being caused to Israel's deterrence posture if, at the
end of the day, it decides to not to attack Iran's nuclear installations.
Coelho once said:

Be careful. You can hurt with your words, but you can also hurt with
your silence.

The words of a wise man.
