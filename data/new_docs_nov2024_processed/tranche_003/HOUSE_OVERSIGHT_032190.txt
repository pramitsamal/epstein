accurate description for Gates may be steady hand on the wheel,
says the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Michael Noonan.

T don't think [Gates's] accomplishments merit the sky-high
reputation that he enjoys as he leaves office, former senior CIA
analyst Paul Pillar says. Gates has long had a knack for nurturing his
own reputation.

Pillar recalls that Gates during his CIA days was always saying, 'I'm
going to whip this organization into shape.' Anything good that
happens, it's because 'I'm head of the organization.’ Anything bad can
be attributed to ‘institutional resistance.

When Gates took over the Pentagon in December 2006, he quickly
demonstrated the diplomatic and political acumen he had acquired as
he worked his way up through the intelligence community as the first
career officer to become CIA director.

Take, for instance, his decision to court Hillary Clinton when she
took over as secretary of state in 2009. One of the few senior Bush
holdovers in the new Obama administration, Gates was keenly aware
of the tensions between the State and Defense departments built up
during the war in Iraq. He invited Clinton to his Pentagon office, and
the two ate lunch at a table that belonged to Confederate President
Jefferson Davis back when he was U.S. secretary of war.

T just told her, based on my experience, that how well the
administration worked would depend a lot on how well she and I got
along together, Gates recalls. If we got along, the message would
go to the entire bureaucracy--not just our own bureaucracies but the
rest of government as well. She totally understood.

Gates made a calculated--and more public--courtship of her entire
agency. I read in the press, and therefore it must be true, that no
secretary of defense had ever been quoted as arguing for a bigger
budget for State, Gates boasts now. The strategy worked. Clinton
