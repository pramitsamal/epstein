From a political and military standpoint, the
Trump defense plan parallels the goals and
objectives of President Reagan’s military
push. And with McCain’s more aggressive
plan aligned on the same premise of
modernizing and improving the readiness
of the US military, Trump will likely have the
backing of this influential member of the
Republican congressional leadership.

Today's Economic Backdrop—

Similar to the 1960s

The economic and financial implications of
a large, multiyear defense-spending plan
must be weighed against the economic
environment at the time of implementation.
And from a historical context, today’s
conditions have more similarities to the
economic setting of the mid- 1960s than
during the defense buildups of the early
1980s or early 2000s, which were either
in recession or the very early stages of
recovery.

In contrast, the US economy in the mid-
1960s was already in its fifth year of
expansion, the jobless rate of 4.5% was
relatively low and inflation was tame
(roughly 1.5%). Nonetheless, the extra
defense spending boosted domestic
demand growth and added significant
pressure to labor costs, materials and
supplies, and product prices. So much so
that the acceleration in consumer price
inflation (from 1% in 1961 to near 6% in
19°70) from the start to the end of that
business cycle was one of the largest of
any economic growth cycle during the
postwar period.

Today’s economic backdrop looks similar in
many ways. The economy has been in
recovery for seven years, the jobless rate is
in the mid-4% range and inflation is stable
(at around 2%). While many domestic and
global factors are different now, we would
still expect a large multiyear defense-

spending program to add to growth and
put upward pressure on labor costs and
inflation in the coming years. Keep in mind
that we’re coming off the weakest five-year
defense spending trend in the past 50
years, so Trump’s defense spending need
not match any of the prior three to have a
major impact.

Stay tuned for the unveiling of Trump’s
budget and pay close attention to the
defense spending request. A large
multi-year program would definitely lift
inflationary pressures. While we wouldn't
expect an acceleration like that in the
1960s, a sustained rise of 100 to 200
basis points in general inflation would still
seem reasonable—and far above what the
Federal Reserve and financial markets are
currently expecting. =
