Leon, 
Yesterday, I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and 
you and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing 
the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be 
helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per 
year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, 
a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. 
boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 
page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, 
home mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead 
of less that 3 million dollars. 
I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights 
. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised 
as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I 
fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those 
things that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you 
wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer 
many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait. 
ONE YEAR AGO 
Feb 17 2014 i wrote : 
With regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong

involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my 
involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the 
complexities who else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with 
little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would 
report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I 
prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer 
be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) 
With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to 
think through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you 
might find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but 
would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure 
what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller 
stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy 
Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into 
consideration. 
TODAY 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023292 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each 
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was 
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very 
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new 
staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying  but Leon 
said  or its on Leon's desk etc , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her 
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by 
me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the 
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation 
,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating 
down my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide 
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your 
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
In order to move forward 
I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention 
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you 
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will 
have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind 
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final 
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every 
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was 
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions 
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no 
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which 
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took 
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my 
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear 
of your own design ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art 
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( 
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you 
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was 
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should 
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said 
you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion 
of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of 
our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. 
However, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the 
required work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. 
share moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . 
always. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.

okay, its time for you to decide how you would like to move forward. ( fyi get your money from the 
1031 . the screw up is only one of many,) If you decide to move foward on decanting. phaidon, note basis 
estate update , each requires many carefully orchestrated detailed steps. and precision. there are hundreds of 
millions in saving if done correctly and a huge mess if not. If you want me and my colleagues to do it, 
oversee it paper it and guide it, you should tell me. It is a big undertaking. If not, ok .. Brad and your crew 
can do it. I will have no real further involvement apart from confirming the outcome of my proposed 
structure, I will not risk the admonition of- they thought you said, they thought you meant, they understood it 
to be. but they said you said, ( i e ,I asked at our meeting that accounting be done properly for bens house, 
what came back was ada thought that I meant that we needed to go back to the 97 trust and give him a full third 
party accounting of where his money had gone??!! I kid you not). I dont think brad should talk to jane heller

Jeffrey-given the high daily interest cost (50k+/-) on $$ borrowed which you pointed out yesterday, here's what 
I'm thinking, but I want to be 100% on the same page as you: 
1. Close next monday on the credit line, but don't borrow any $$. (We can, of course push closing back but my 
preference wld be to close.) 
2. Right now, at barry's request, Irene Steiner, on behalf of the trustees is reviewing apol and apo-ol. While 
probably not impt on a substantive basis it was (a) impt to barry and (b) is likely good for leon. 
3. We are hoping to have signature pages to the trustees (and returned to us) by early to mid next week. (Ada 
will oversee.) 
4. We will then get the new trust to bofa who, moving quickly (according to them), will have an acct open the 
following week, 12/7-9. 
5. We need to manage execution of paperwork associated with decanting which I assume occurs once apo-ol 
and bank acct are operative. (Ada I'm sure you'll be on top of this). 
6. I assume we will move $$ to pay down loan the day or day after (?) apo-01 bank acct open. As you know we 
cld do this as early as next monday/tuesday but then cash will be sitting in apo-1 while we're waiting for apo-01 
bank acct. 
7. If there are sales of assets (or 'lc's) from leon to apol or apo-01 that needs to be buttoned down and 
organized asap. 
8. Same if you want another NEW trust in the mix as that will involve paperwork and opening an acct with 
bank. 
Let's discuss to make sure we're on the same page on process. B

I have mixed emotions about what transpired today. really, You saw first hand in nauseating detail what i 
have been saying to you for quite a while now. Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible, the charts he 
prepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I have recently gotten 
along quite well, I thought. Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar number. no cash flow 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023296 
after weeks of requesting? odd. when you suggested that heathers behavior was emblematic of a sloppy 
office , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay, admittedly no change for the year. . plane not 
done. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july . . I sent you a list of 10 consultantts. brad said 
three, . i didnt want to push it. I was shocked that brad was opining on things he knows little or nothing 
about. tax issues. 1031. neg basis, note payoffs ( the same idea he said he had had from the beggining??!!) 
. answers re LBF holdings that can be corrected ( they cant) . valuations that have never been read. . When 
we met in your lobby he seems surprised that i was there. I dont know if he felt somewhat sandbagged. . . 
the savings on the note payoff is aprrox 33 % of 1.8 billion, real money if you do phaidon which i see no 
reason not to . if later josh and ben want to buy it back with you or without you they can. i will walk you 
through the structure one on one. . the losses will offeset the calder gain as well as apollo gain. 
Im aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you. I felt badly for you. 
You wanted a contingent deal. real value. etc. I will not of course hold you to your deal . . its silly. its not 
how i work or a reflection of our friendship, my proposal is as follows. I want away from your buisiness , but 
at the same time leaving you in good shape. I think you should pay the 25m that you did not for this 
year. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are done. I will give 
you advice and counsel but new people will be running your operating machine. I will oversee all the work 
that needs to be done you and I will hire new people , and it will be self running. ( it was may in my house 
when you told brad it had been 5 months and you were getting fed up ) I will set up a parallel. office , somenoe 
like wendy dolman or her quality is paramount. two accountants two bookeepers and two office 
admins. . alan and zoe will handle trusts and grats. heatehr diana george will be incolved in art partnership. if 
you want brad, analysts etc. and kids to do investments I have little to add in that regard ,except to be able to 
account for things properly. I suggest that the kids must have skin in any deal. 
Alternatively , we can continue to focus on fun and let someone else do the things that you want done. and 
you and I can kibbitz about it all. structures outcomes risk, museums. charity, ( joslins answer by the way 
was I had asked how much charity was leon planining to give this year , ( the 2 m ) he didnt include your 
foundation or the payment to me, or from debra and you??!!

As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do as a friend, and a great deal that 
I have already done ( both known and some things that willneed to remain unknown.) Our arrangement was 
for me to architect sophisticated structures that would be beneficial to you. that is what I have done and will 
continue do in order to fulfill my obligations under our agreement. The discovered fact that you in reality 
need an entire family office built from scratch has been trying I have aleady agreed de- facto to try 
to help. I would suggest that Phaidons payroll and attention pales in importance to your personal 
structure,which has taken a back seat, Some of my suggestions regarding the Eysium office are as 
follows you will need a budget of 3- 5 million per year. CEO 1 million, new tax person to work with rich, 
250. new bookkeeper ,200 new paralegal to work with ADA ALan etc , coordinating with Apollo, Akin , paul 
weiss , new acct openings, sec filings , sales tax review, etc. $150 . art point person. loan, inventory,

will continue to say so , and you obviously decide. but I will reiterrate even in the face of your nobody is 
good enough argument. keeping foremost in my mind that you and I have only beeen shown a very tiny 
handful of people. 4. I find the friction over fees , counterproductive, in an attempt to avoid it I had 
suggested a multi year deal early on. you rejected it. I then suggested, and urged you to have an option at a 
fixed fee , you also rejected that .you wanted the fee payment only at the end I argued but ,conceded. I 
suggested a structure that tom didn't like, you rejected it. 5 I suggest you make a fair proposal.- that i can 
either accept or reject. some payment up front this time is a requirement. I am willing to modify any outstanding 
obligations. - there are creative ways to assure you of your desired characterization of those payments. 6 you 
should open accts at Deutsh. and goldman. I am told that eilleen has set up over one hundred bank acccts for

Leon, 
Yesterday, I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and 
you and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing 
the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be 
helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per 
year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, 
a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. 
boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 
page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, 
home mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead 
of less that 3 million dollars. 
I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights 
. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised 
as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I 
fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those 
things that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you 
wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer 
many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait. 
ONE YEAR AGO

With regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong 
inclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many 
that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people 
involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my 
involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the 
complexities who else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023299 
little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would 
report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I 
prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer 
be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) 
With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to 
think through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you 
might find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but 
would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure 
what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller 
stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy 
Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into 
consideration. 
TODAY 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each 
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was 
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very 
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new 
staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying  but Leon 
said  or its on Leon's desk etc , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her 
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by 
me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the 
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation 
,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating 
down my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide 
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your 
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
In order to move forward 
I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention 
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you 
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will 
have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind 
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final 
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every 
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was 
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions 
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no 
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which 
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took 
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my 
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear 
of your own design ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art 
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( 
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023300 
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was 
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should 
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said 
you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion 
of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of 
our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. 
However, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the 
required work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. 
share moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . 
always. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.

Transaction complete ! 
. this - in spite of your collection of Elysium misfits. !!! 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his utter incompetence was 
brought front and center, he may be a step up from Eileen, but if he is, then it is not certainly not by much, . 
Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of details and mechanics. I was not 
shown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his so called 
advisors however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get 
to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the 
list I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your 
office still remains virtually undone. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023304 
IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without 
brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is 
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. 
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is 
rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they 
said that is the question they get asked !  were they deducted  not 2 is there a benefit !! I asked for the 
balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. sorry we never 
got one? though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo 
fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
The following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
the paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you 
consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank 
loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do 
will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid 
of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more 
protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art 
division with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra 
died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads 
chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common 
agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. 
. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150 b they have a 
distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK 
visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on 
transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the 
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and 
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that i would go back on my word I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. 
From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . 
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was

Transaction complete ! 
When we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple times 
that i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont have many 
friends and didnt want money to interefer with our unique relationship. For five years you had the kind but 
goofy Eileen Alexandersson managing your accounting, legal, investments, reporting, trusts etc. When I told 
you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed she was incompetent you admonished me for speaking out of 
both sides of my mouth . With regard Brad Wechsler, there is no  both sides. . I have 
consistantly maintained since day one that he was highly unsuited for the job. When you initially asked me to 
help convince him to take the role , promising him a postion to manage mirage investments I sent you a note 
saying instead you should pay up and get first class people. I have reiterated the same message for over a year 
now.. Brad, not me was tasked with hiring new people and as you wanted him to take ownership of the 
staff,he conducted many interviews, you may recall that as late as may, you told him in my presence that he had 
had six months and had not hired anyone. since then I have rectified errors in sales tax, use tax, income 
tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions. ,( last nov ) 11 million found in dormant accounts 
and 4 million in the drawer. errors in cash flow both personal and Phaidon. Oversight on new grats first at 22 
and then at 19 that were done without my consulatation were resolved only as aresult of my intervention. . 600 
million in after tax savings was just accomplished. 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his total and 
utter incompetence was brought clearly, front and center. He may be a step up from Eileen, but, if he is, 
then it is certainly not by much, A major difference is that Eileen knew she was over her head. Brad struts his 
stupiditly whenever he gets a chance. 
A critical example. - Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of care 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023307 
and attention to details and mechanics. with regard Phaidon I was not shown one single document, not 
one.!! Brad wanted to keep it private between he, and his so called advisors however as he was out of the 
office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the 
situation in your office is totally ludicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - 
of things I thought were a priority to get done - still remains in the whole unresolved. 
The IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperate need of a format - reporting flawed cumbersome and 
inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off exercises , when either you or brad ask for it - airplane: re structure, 
(my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all 
done.( the office was told by Brad not to share the outside proposals with me - brad has no idea even as to 
what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in the office. a little 
man , using your power, to appear larger. Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is 
a huge difference. bad info is rampant a simple emblematic example- 3 million in deductions Im told 
were taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit 
) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they said that is the only real question you were 
focused on !  were they deducted not 2 is there a benefit !! I asked for the balance sheet and P and L 
for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. sorry we never got one? though 9.8 
million invested, no p&l, nothing!, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo fired after only 3 
months., no clue. fyi artspace financials are also a total mess. ( no receivables ??). when i asked for a list of 
what got done and did not, i received the email from Brad basicailly mind you own business, so much was 
promised. !!! 
As in your words probably your closest friend and in order to turn the page. I hope the following to 
be constructive 
Here is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
a paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their importance. THe Phaidon transaction papered 
and structured as contemplated DOES NOT WORK, its as simple as that. DOES NOT !! I suggest again 
that you re-do bank loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no 
longer trustee. re- do will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for 
executor role. get rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed 
ages. put more protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make 
decisions. , decide art division with children in attendance. have fire drill done on estate. fill out 
estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled 
out was his own. Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., A strategy of the use of art should be 
implemented. . you have tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. . boat 
consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA, BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, I still think you might consider a 
Rothshcild bank transaction they have 150 b and a distribution network with no products , private 
bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk 
about Rowen request re Athene , complex 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then only after weeks, when you 
delayed any detailed discussion of money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully 
understand ) . you unilaterally changed changed our agreement. . 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and 
out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only a third. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and the 
artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023308 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that i would go back on my word I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay 
I included in this letter the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out 
my understanding of the compensation for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just 
completed. though the number was great it was clear. When it appeared that the details could now be worked 
out I was the first to say, it is too much money, however. 
From day zero I proposed to discount to 50 - 60 million the fair price of the transaction just completed. 
including Phaidon. . though this amount was already substantially less than our agreed and negotiated 
formula. - I was never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane, or 
an -in-kind payment were discussed ( ie including keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I 
provided as you specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that 
i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then 
told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question 
that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including any wayt 
to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of your largest asset by far , the BRH 
agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it 
was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were wearing a brightly colored clown

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, 
Mark was here this morning , the proposed transactions are extremely complex . and would take a great deal 
of detailed time. I do not know how, and if ,to move forward - our last transaction. a transaction which you 
saved 600 million in tax. even if as you say it could be 20 years away, ( i hope longer) discounted to today is 
a savings of 300 million . for some reason you chose to ignore our agreements , verbal written and emailed - 
and decided that it was only worth 8 million dollars to you.. ( assuming phaidon -richard happens. the 
calculation that you can see is a 24 m savings not including artspace and debt benefits- certain to come later

deal of my detailed time. I do not know how, and even, if ,to move forward - . After months of hearing that 
you would have no problem paying a large fee if you could only ascertain value. The last transaction. a

want to disoccount for its future realization, creating a savings of over 300 million real dollars. For some

provided. then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for the group to follow You told 
me that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be paid, (and even that 
was more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did 
brad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it 
would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were 
never consummated, i would not be owed a dime, however , the expected fee was known up front. , the 
detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the 
transaction had even begun, had already been heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re 
only paying 20 m has frankly, left me felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or 
Rothschild transaction.

you've agreed that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023312 
Your office is a multi billion dollar responsibility, your children will inherit it, in order to oversee their 
financial lives- I feel for you, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provided one bad 
document after another for over a year, no getting away from it,, bad cash flows no new IT, each time 
with its gettting better no in fact -! its not. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is ludicrous. 
of course he didnt actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but over and over he presented them to 
you and me , after, holding them back for his personal review multiple times and after multiple drafts. weeks 
of his editing, the consistant but inexplicable missing the obvious serious errors . ( gaming ) inaccuracies, 
( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like 
you ,also give points for effort. )- ! an elegant art partnership gone fallow. ??!!I and its core reason to exist. 
not used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why? no docs for decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last 
night,  no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest  . why wasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant 
reminders i spoke to him , he knows little of either transaction except for over view, never saw pahidon 
anything except projections until yesterday ? ?and this after your clear admonition etc. re the trading 
accounts no activity, at all, 
Barry Cohen is great. more like him please . 
you asked, - I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were 
never going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands ? Brad at its head . you can't as a 
ceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether and not 
notice, you and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He 
told me he didnt know the details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no more than that, any 
other story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself. 
re your estate. Yes another Brad issue - your will, needs revision, the tenants in common structure I assume 
Alan has carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious 
issues in an email but we can speak over the weekend. 
How can I help? We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him, I would bear no 
responsibility because it was clear that he shouldnt be hired. brad and you both said , its on us, but... the 
equivalent of your art consultant pointing to a picasso and calling it a renoir. then a brancusi and calling it a 
michaelangelo. those were the types of erros that i saw immediatily, you said give them more time. at least 
they saw it was a painting and not a photo? 
being weaned of our biz /pay realtionship has been our mutual goal. However since novemebr, you chose to 
do so by ignoring' our agreement re, phaidon,and your oft stated commitment to me of large payments for 
large value, ( 37 percent was our number ). chose to pay me a number picked by what appears to be only by 
whim,- have yet to justify it except for telling me that you and Brad Karp talked.. . 
What should we do? the next two years in biz world appears to both you and I , very fragile. Im happy to 
have brad sit in ?

today is Oct 15 
With your full knowledge I paid out 8 mil to my staff before june, . so i guess I can safely assume that after 
consideration of all the things I did for the entire past year separate and apart from your unique free after 
care concept. , what you thought was ultimately fair was the contribution of 5 million to a foundation 
and a total of 2 million dollars to me.

josh's arrival cut short our needed conversation. I understand we have a difference of opinion, friends 
sometimes disagree, I shook on the 20 so you have no further obligation, none, I am willing to have brad 
karp hear both sides. as my view, you and i had an agreement. on phaidon /publishing, and then a long 
standing what you say is 28, which is correct AFTer TAx. , 37 pre. . that was our numbers. I was clear what 
i thought the transactions were worth. far less than full. alan etc. , had you said i will pay you only 20. i 
would have said ill pass. you never told me that 50-60 the number that i put on the table at the very beginning 
was not right, you asked that i lay out my plan step by step. and what i believe would have been the fair thing 
to do is say to me, I will pay you only 20 if you do as i ask, not tell me for the first time only after i laid it 
all out. had it not been you, i would have required payment in escrow. BEFORE fyi the reason I sent you 
an invoice so that if you decided that you wanted me to continue this year . it would be applied to last years 
income. I think today was a beginiing for you. I am glad I will meet wendy the 23, rd, . separate and aprt 
from being your sounding board for personal issues, I do not see my involvment moving forward.
