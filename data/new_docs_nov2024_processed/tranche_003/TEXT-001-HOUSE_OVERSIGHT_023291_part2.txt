Tenancy in common is a type of shared ownership of property, where each owner owns a share of the 
property. Unlike in a joint tenancy, these shares can be of unequal size, and can be freely transfered to other 
owners both during life and via a will. Even if owners own unequal shares, however, all owners have the right 
to occupy and use all of the property.

The fire drill documents received should be the final nail in the coffin of Alan and Ada, . It is inexcusable, 
, ludricrous and in brads words insane or yours,  unexplainable that the two people that you refer to as 
your estate attnys , NEVER EVER took the time to actually read the documents that have the biggest efffect 
on your family and estate upon death or disablity, its impossible.!!! IMPOSSIBLE . after telling me that they 
were confident that everything had been read, and after years , of you telling me that Im not an attorney, it is 
clear that my telling you that you have c quality people was over generous„ I received a first draft of the 
summary of documents. you should read them for yourself. . executive committee issues. , unclear 
tax. contradictory provisions,your reps having to rely possibly on a fall back to delaware law to protect your 
interests, even suggesting that even if they would like to fall back, in some instances - no case law. other 
crazy- provisions that are personal to you, instead of you and your successor ? two pages of open to 
interpretation .or aha, maybe something is wrong! as ie, your rep, after death has no right for information 
on BRH? ! if you and another founder are dead , the exec commitee has no decision authority, if josh and mark 
want to fuck your heirs, its easy, black family partner docs dont deal with successionl YOU deserve better 
. fyi, after a month of brad ada and alan ,on the project, still not willing to share with me a final, they are 
all embarassed. and full of excuses . 
It will take wendy and a new team 6 to 9 months to put your house in order. , new cash flows, new 
accounting system, airplane rethought„ you new hires can find deals , they can familiarize themselves with 
your current investments , but should not be doing the accounting for them, . 
your will is still not amended, ?! the tenants in common not even explained to you. if something happens to 
you and debra, no real direction for the foundation. . etc

glad to see you are personally on the mend - as well as the fence. -- As you know i dread money 
discussions with you-- however -we should address the issue of what you would like to do moving forward. re-
do family office, accounting trusts , estate and apollo agreements . Along with your  payment  last year 
we agreed. no further obligations on each side. yes, i continued to moan. I realize that though I ve done 
quite a lot this year already , it is not your responsibility. . As you often like to remind me- you've paid a 
great deal of money to date. that being said - If you want my involvement moving foward, I suggest 
you pay my regular 1 fee of 40 m. 20 now. 20 on completion or as per the invoice issues at the end of last 
year pay 30 all at once. - 
To help out . im keenly aware of your current cash position. so I will consider an in-kind payment - real 
estate ( Miami )„art , financing of my new plane (allows you to spread over years or of course the preferred 
cash. Get rid of Castrucci,it is over a year since the same story of findign the right guy at the top. you 
entire accounting needs to be re done. , office downsized, reporting re done. meetings to recitify, categlorize 
, the various docs re appollo, rowen, suydam, alan etc. Brad can direct investment guys, ( hopefully) my 
people will be in your office for a few months . reorganizing IF you decide not to pay I fully understand, as I 
m sure you will re my no longer spending any serious time on these things. 
Of course re any non financial issues, I am always there for you and will continue to be the best friend I can 
be 
Steve jobs said that everyday he woke up , and asked himself, if he knew he was going to die tomorow , would 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023315 
he do the same thing that he had planned for the day- he wanted to check that he was doing things that he 
really wanted to. after three days of getting back an answer of no, he would change what he was going to do. . 
he also did not believe in LONG term plans. I dont think either one of us will figure out what we want to do 
long term so my thinking is that we should try to have fun everyday, and welcome serendipity. 
I think another trust and estate lawyer should be brought in to deal with the issues of how not to allow your 
family to get screwed by your partners on death. Alan, for years told me that paul weiss had drawn the 
docs so no issue but when recently pushed by my new fire drill he asked akin to draft.?! PLease ask brad 
about why he keeps talking about flow. I dont know what he means, its so silly. . this is only about money

To: Melanie Spinella 
Lets start. I am aware that you are currently angry at the world. . me, karp wechsler. even 
yourself, all willing absorbers of the current high heat. (though you ,calling me ,Debra, did take away some 
of the sting ) I am sorry to see you this way. 
emblematic; I was asked to opine on whether to hire castrucci. an hour after I gave a preliminary yes. . I 
called you then texted you that i had thought more about it and changed my mind. The next day brad called 
and asked for my vote. I told him ,in no uncertain terms it is a no , I categorically vote no. I called 
you . you came to see me. I said it was a bad idea. you said you were going to do it anyway , I said and 
followed up in writing IT IS A MISTAKE . and added Please don't come back to me with anything suggesting 
otherwise , you and I should be clear I think it is wrong . A very strong NO. you of course can hire whomever 
you like. 
early on I told you I thought Tom remarkably careless . Eilleen goofy and your art lawyer not well informed to 
say the least. you told me Tom was a senior partner. Eileen had headed the trading desk, and Ralph Lerner had 
to know what he was doing as he wrote the book. . I said I thought you deserved better ,should get better 
people and no , I am not an HR person. yesterday you told me that the reason you have hired whomver you 
could find was to avoid being dependent on me. a decision by far, not the best place to try to save money ) 
Joslin- who you say I hired. I neither found nor hired. With a two person given choice I approved joslin over 
some woman that eileen preferred. against my repeated advice you and eileen decided the pay range at under 
300k. I told you at that time that I would personally pay the difference for a higher quality person, that was 
years ago. I have sent over a hundred emails to you clearly saying he needs to be closely managed by 
better professionals. initially, that referred to Eillen and Ada.and after, brad. john etc. THere are 
many emails each and every month from me, telling you , he is slipping failing cracking fragile. . crazy, nuts, 
heading towards incompetence. Unless YOU- TAKE ACTION! when I pressured him for accurate numbers, 
you told him, to tell me, that he works for you and NOT for me. . When I continued to press for accuracy from 
your office , you told me that they were now all afraid of me and i should let brad communicate any requests, ( 
you now tell me  we know what Brad is?). When I told you you office needs to be reviewed and changed you 
told me i was being destructive rather than constructive, when i ultimately confronted joslin, in an attempt to 
protect you, told him that his numbers were wildly inaccurate , you told me that i had caused his ultimate 
resignation and now have an affirmative obligation to fill in the resultant gap. 
I did give you a bad number, and apologized as soon as i realized it. an error that was an embarrassment for me 
, the fact that that the accurate number is still way below what you agreed to pay, has fallen by the 
wayside.( the preposterous argument that the end of year transaction was Alans idea , which you now know 
was not true and that me not receiving Phaidon documents was unexplainable, was your justification 
though, for non - full payment ) 
Hopefully You will recall that when you initially asked for my help. I declined repeatedly with the 
admonition that that having a financial arrangement is fraught with danger and could complitcate our 
friendship (as you will be unhappy paying what you will view as a large sum. while choosing to ignore 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023316 
the financial benefits, ). In Bedford , I repeated my concern. THe current circumstance is distressing to me , I 
have done my utmost to keep you safe. and will continue to do so. reckless choices in accounting or 
otherwise does not bode well. at each turn I have put your interests first, including in some instances 
attempting to fight your choices. 
your current circumstance needs nuanced attention. as you know, there are a few areas with very serious 
consequences. whether it be , having Ada, form grats without review, brad doing phaidon without review. 
payments make without review.merely in order to be weaned, is one more high risk choice. review of outside 
accounting firms , CANNOT be done by brad. to have your accounting dept sit in on Alans trust accounting 
lecture. in order to learn the filed is reminiscent of elieen reading the tax regs. ( she also was going to take a 
course)

A couple of questions: 
1. Jeffrey-you saw the format in which we organized the back-up for year one of grat 1 (quite thick/alot of back-
up). 
Does that format work (for you and internal use) or do you want it simplified/modified. Let's discuss. 
2. Since this will take the focus and effort of a lot of people (just to pull and organize the various records...both 
legal and accting, I'd like to tell the staff that we are answering an information request from the irs on the 
grats. It will generally be helpful for them to know why the work is impt. 
You and leon ok with this? 
Will call you to discuss.

Subject: tight schedule lets try a set time to speak 
To: Melanie Spinella 
Leon, you hired me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive, the value far exceeds any other piece in 
your collection.- by FAR. It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand your desire to 
modifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me, just a bit more red., here let me show 
you, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I 
vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work. . you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a 
reaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you have the right to paint 
over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours. 
I was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review some things. brad told me 
,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea 
. Having them review things without even asking for my input, or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I 
guess you wanted to save money. ? 
The audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie 
. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there, joslin part 
time, but relied on. joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team, 
accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money again 
?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, it was the first thing on my list of things that were 
needed to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of, though its prophylactic quality has been discussed 
over and over during the past three years. computers do not read Page Six. the women at the IRS do. ! you 
said your motivation in keeping this group of part timers was a consequence of the high cost of my 
artwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - now 
If you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH 
assignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not progressed 
very far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought 
in at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, . sucession, technology, tax 
and compliance, investment reporting „ computerized timelines for filings etc. . household 
classifcations and reporting with a system of best practices. 
My goal is clear - to end, not extend, our financial interactions, you will have a machine that works , it 
will not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for my 
works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad 
number when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly clear. that 
you have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but again its value exceeds 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023318 
anything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please also remember that you and i 
agreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big transaction. 
OR, you can decide that brad , tom, and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they can 
oversee your audits. they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought in but i 
would be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story. 
-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make no 
judgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them. not my role I am always on your side 
on the table. I hope your personal life quiets. you 've had a rough 15 months.

As i said yesterday, pointing out places where i think my friend might be taking unnecesarry risks has

entities. you told me over the past two years that as i set them up i should be responsible for their 
operation. That was never the deal , never. I have heard after -care etc for quite a while. in dec when you 
unilatierally decided to pay me much less than our agreed amount , we agreed NO MORE money 
discussions NO MORE after care. The silliness has reached its pinnacle when you suggest i am responsible for 
the lack of sophisticaiton and thoughtfulness of the 1031 transactions that NO one even told me about. asked 
my advice or gave me any notice at all before the fact. same as the structure for the CAlif house. I would 
remind you , though Heather is great, it was not she that modified the gagosian contract to give you the

Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but I m encouraged and glad for 
you. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before 
him. what would you like me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i 
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you 
like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a 
long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and 
Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get 
him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023319 
direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of 
warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told 
you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for 
me and that brad needs to pays him . 
. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up 
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but 
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you 
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect 
you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out 
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really 
dangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no 
responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion 
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he 
too is still there, and a waste of money and space. 
My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re 
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and 
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess. 
That being said, the tasks at hand are the following. 
You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully 
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would 
be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I am 
concerned re brad taking barrys place re )(XXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn 
ACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 months 
to just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., 
a way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts, filing 
requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into 
new plan. .  planning. art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying another. . ? boat 
sale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an accounting system. fire john 
.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather everyone should be replaced with 
new. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock 
sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you 
CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will be very detailed work. . a self 
inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. or contain it. . . you will need 
3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you 
know. He will need to be trained. note 
; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin,: im glad 
that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the fact that after 
only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more. 
I expect as a friend you will understand that 
I will no longer, not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long 
overdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul 
weiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I had 
previously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can 
not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you 
wont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge 
If I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I hope 
you understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as 
to avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023320 
you , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as follows. I will only work for the usual 40 
million per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every 2 months 
thereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i am able in January. I will immediately stop 
work, if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 
million, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with 
professionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any 
painting you could possible own. . no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the 
hour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say.

sent to you JAN 29th 2016 
you've agreed that 
Your office is a multi billion dollar responsibility, your children will inherit it, in order to oversee their 
financial lives- I feel for you, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provided one bad 
document after another for over a year, no getting away from it,, bad cash flows no new IT, each time 
with its gettting better no in fact -! its not. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is ludicrous. 
of course he didnt actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but over and over he presented them to 
you and me , after, holding them back for his personal review multiple times and after multiple drafts. weeks 
of his editing, the consistant but inexplicable missing the obvious serious errors . ( gaming ) inaccuracies, 
( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like 
you ,also give points for effort. )- ! an elegant art partnership gone fallow. ??! !I and its core reason to exist. 
not used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why? no docs for decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last 
night,  no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest  . why wasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant 
reminders your admonition etc. the trading accounts ? 
Barry Cohen is great. more like him please . 
you asked, - I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were 
never going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands ? Brad at its head . you can't as a 
ceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether and not 
notice, you and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He 
told me he didnt know the details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no more than that, any 
other story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself. 
re your estate. Yes another Brad issue - your will, needs revision, the tenants in common structure I assume 
Alan has carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious 
issues in an email but we can speak over the weekend. 
How can I help? We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him, I would bear no 
responsibility

Subject: tight schedule lets try a set time to speak 
To: Melanie Spinella______________________________ 
Leon, you hired me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive, the value far exceeds any other piece in 
your collection.- by FAR. It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand your desire to 
modifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me, just a bit more red., here let me show 
you, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I 
vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work. . you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a 
reaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you have the right to paint 
over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours. 
I was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review some things. brad told me 
,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea 
. Having them review things without even asking for my input, or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023325 
guess you wanted to save money. ? 
The audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie 
. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there, joslin part 
time, but relied on. joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team, 
accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money again 
?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, it was the first thing on my list of things that were 
needed to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of, though its prophylactic quality has been discussed 
over and over during the past three years. computers do not read Page Six. the women at the IRS do. ! you 
said your motivation in keeping this group of part timers was a consequence of the high cost of my 
artwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - now 
If you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH 
assignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not progressed 
very far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought 
in at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, . sucession, technology, tax 
and compliance, investment reporting „ computerized timelines for filings etc. . household 
classifcations and reporting with a system of best practices. 
My goal is clear - to end, not extend, our financial interactions, you will have a machine that works , it 
will not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for my 
works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad 
number when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly clear. that 
you have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but again its value exceeds 
anything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please also remember that you and i 
agreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big transaction. 
OR, you can decide that brad , tom, and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they can 
oversee your audits . they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought in but i 
would be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story. 
-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make no 
judgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them. not my role I am always on your side 
on the table. I hope your personal life quiets. you 've had a rough 15 months.

IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without 
brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is 
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. 
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is 
rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they 
said that is the question they get asked !  were they deducted  not 2 is there a benefit !! I asked for the 
balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. sorry we never 
got one? though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo 
fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
The following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023326 
the paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you 
consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank 
loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do 
will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid 
of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more 
protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art 
division with children in attendance. have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra 
died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads 
chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common 
agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. 
. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150 b they have a 
distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK 
visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on 
transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the 
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and 
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that i would go back on my word I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. 
From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . 
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were 
discussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a 
detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not 
forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a 
discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three 
years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made 
a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they 
were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in 
writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and 
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp 
that only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I 
feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was 
never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to 
send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be 
owed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and 
overseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily 
discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement. I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly 
left me felling quite uneasy. 
since you asked since last nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens

from grats.. may 1 after months of brad not finding anyone i sent an email saying you would have to pay 
more. . on april 15. I sent an email detailing payments owed if i could figure out the basis issue, please see 
attached,. 
questions you might ask your team ask them to provide a balance sheet or p&l for REgan arts. . doesnt exist 
ask. either wechsler or haperin to tell you what brh is, or how the tra works. . . ? as bronstein to tell you why 
the proposed phaidon transaction DOES not work. . as them to give you a plan for the plane. ? ask them to 
show you the cash mgmt for over 100 million dollars. . ask them to show you the IT system progress after one 
year. . the approval process for payables. . the cash flow projections? assumptions? ask for a comparative 
review of investments. ask haperin to describle to you in any detail BRH, the major asset of his two biggest 
clients, tax basis, disposiotion in the estate. . etc. ask brad to show you the liquidation of the inteveing art space 
cos? . 
Last year you asked, for my help I told you I preferred not as we would be better off having no financial 
intereactions. the risk was not worth it. You told me that as my friend i had to do it I agreed., here we are 
in what I find to be an awkward situation. the transactions that i decvised were used , our agreement was 
ignored. and im not sure how to respond.

brad, leon. 
After I spoke to you both, I excused myself from a dinner with some heads of state to walk into the bathroom 
to make some calls re 8865. I wondered whether any group that we could assert had control had filed in the 
past years. I called Fenn and he told me- yes.???!! he said that on friday, for the first time he learned that 
AGM was not delinquent at all. and had filed.!! I asked why no one had ever told me or given me the 
purported justification for no filings in the past for the founders. and he said Well, sorry, it was discussed 
on fridays call. ? the call i was not on . not invited to ,the call wechsler didnt listen in and joslin didnt 
transmit , if it is true. Im also now told there is a note from Deloitte re 13 and 14 that says the founders DO 
NOT have to file. but fenn could not tell me who wrote it and said Deloitte says to ignore it. , that s why they 
are pushing now. 
Melanie Spinella 
steps 1 8865 has many exemptions for filing, let see if we can find one . ( an elegant position might be josh 
and agm if he is panicked and leave us out ). The requirments are FACT specific , so without the facts we still 
have nothing. fenn said he has now put someone on it 
2 leon, I suggest need to focus on 1040 , 2015. , we may even consider filing the minimum 8865 , 
and wait until we are sure of our specific requirements, and file an amendment for 15 as well as past. no harm

Leon please read the attached proposed response to the IRS , see if you can understand it !!!. lye asked for a 
re-do. and given prelimiary directions to Alan to have it edited over the weekend 
. If you are quarterbacking ,ok with me. just please let everyone know. you must deal with the outrageous 
incompetence in your family office.. Alans words  but I was told that.. , but I was told by the office (sic) 
that ... , BUT i was told by joslin,. , but I was told by.  why is leon blaming me for .. . I ve have always 
given you my best advice, If you reflect on your financial life, you have been kept safe , had remarkable 
results and no disasters. I have repeatedly urged you to get rid of the people in your office. , you 
have repeatedly chosen to ignore my advice , you told me last week that the emotional reason was in order 
to be weaned off my group and not have to pay my high fees. ( though ignoring the benefit of between 1.5 
and 2b to the better. ) . and no explosions. You have email after email ,where i remind you that I am not 
your bookkeeper or accountant ( in brads corporate speak his finance dept ??!!) that it should be redone .I 
have reviewed a multitude of the silly reports given to you and have pointed out the continued numerous 
inaccuracies. your question so what if the numbers are off, so what if the categories are off whats the big 
deal??. I suggest you de risk you finances and make the tough decisions necessary - pay the right amounts ( 
high) to get the work done properly or , you are, Im afraid, certain to get an unhappy answer.. tom will be

To: Melanie Spindle___________________________ 
Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but I m encouraged and glad for 
you. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before 
him. what would you like me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i 
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you 
like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a 
long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and 
Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get 
him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his 
direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of 
warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told 
you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for 
me and that brad needs to pays him . 
. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up 
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but 
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you 
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect 
you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out 
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really 
dangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said, I take no 
responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion 
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he 
too is still there, and a waste of money and space. 
My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re 
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and 
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess. 
That being said, the tasks at hand are the following. 
You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully 
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would 
be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I am 
concerned re brad taking barrys place re )(XXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn 
ACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 months 
to just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., 
a way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts, filing 
requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into 
new plan. .  planning. art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying another. . ? boat 
sale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an accounting system. fire john 
.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather everyone should be replaced with 
new. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023330 
sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you 
CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will be very detailed work. . a self 
inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. or contain it. . . you will need 
3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you 
know. He will need to be trained. note 
; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin,: im glad 
that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the fact that after 
only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more. 
I expect as a friend you will understand that 
I will no longer, not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long 
overdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul 
weiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I had 
previously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can 
not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you 
wont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge 
If I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I hope 
you understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as 
to avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with 
you , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as follows . I will only work for the usual 40 
million per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every 2 months 
thereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i am able in January. I will immediately stop 
work, if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 
million, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with 
professionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any 
painting you could possible own. . no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the 
hour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say.

To: Melanie Spinella_________________________________ 
I have told the brads and barry,- I am done. its not a negotiation, out!! - fyi given my carlyn joslin 
castrucci, admonishments,- though my involvement in those - in one instance only gave a name - in 
another only given an eileen dictated choice btween two 250k preparers. and for castrucci, I actually sent 
emails that i take no responsiblity for his being hired. - however you felt strongly that I should be saddled 
with their outcomes .even with brad wechsler, i again said two months in, Leon, he doesnt get it. I tell you 
this so that you will understand that I will not interview, recommend or vet any new hire. 
A story - In 1993 trump and I had a friend that kept telling his pilots how to fly, and when to fly, he couldnt 
help himself from hiring morons as co pilots, and maintenance people based on cheapest rates. Donald and I 
tried and tried to talk some sense into him, to no avail. Donald and I were in aspen, sitting at little 
nells. when the friends plane crashed into the side of aspen mountain , klliing him and all on board,- Trump 
looked at me and said without a blink , I guess NOW he wishes he would have listened to us.- a metaphor for 
your office. . . had we not waited to the very last hour having had a six month window and tens of 
unasnwered text and emails re decisions needed including the 1031. you would have saved way more than 
you often feel obliged to argue about. . silly but i reallize you are stressed. 
Barry will need to sit with brad for months, to absorb all the co's , structures. cash flow, financial statments 
etc. I will present barry my thoughts on the overall redo , it will be the exact same email that i presented to 
you and brad two years.ago . accurate numbers first. and foremost. . ( last week gaming report stil 
funky). IT etc I pointed out some of the more glaring errors to barry to give him a flavor of what is to come. 
Tuesday if you like we should discuss Giacometti , and pesner . difficult to finesse him if they are 
filing documents that you won't. these ridiculous conversations with tons of people on the phone , removes 
any claim you might have to not be considered a WILLFUL NON-FILER. ( after youve been told by attnys

serious penalties up the kazoo.

To: Melanie Spinella - 
Leon, 
Yesterday, I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and 
you and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing 
the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be 
helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per 
year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, 
a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. 
boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 
page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, 
home mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead 
of less that 3 million dollars. 
I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights 
. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised 
as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I 
fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those 
things that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you 
wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer 
many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait. 
ONE YEAR AGO 
Feb 17 2014 i wrote : 
With regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong 
inclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many 
that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people 
involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my 
involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the 
complexities who else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with 
little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would 
report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I 
prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer 
be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) 
With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to 
think through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you 
might find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but 
would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure 
what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller 
stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy 
Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into 
consideration. 
TODAY 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each 
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023332 
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very 
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new 
staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying  but Leon 
said  or its on Leon's desk etc , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her 
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by 
me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the 
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation 
,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating 
down my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide 
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your 
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
In order to move forward 
I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention 
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you 
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will 
have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind 
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final 
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every 
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was 
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions 
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no 
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which 
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took 
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my 
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear 
of your own design ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art 
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( 
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you 
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was 
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should 
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said 
you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion 
of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of 
our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. 
However, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the 
required work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. 
share moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route. 
always. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.

Transaction complete ! 
. this - in spite of your collection of Elysium misfits. !!! 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his utter incompetence was 
brought front and center, he may be a step up from Eileen, but if he is, then it is not certainly not by much, . 
Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of details and mechanics. I was not 
shown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his so called 
advisors however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get 
to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the 
list I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your 
office still remains virtually undone. 
IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without 
brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is 
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. 
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is 
rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they 
said that is the question they get asked !  were they deducted  not 2 is there a benefit !! I asked for the 
balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. sorry we never 
got one? though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo 
fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023334 
The following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
the paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you 
consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank 
loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do 
will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid 
of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more 
protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art 
division with children in attendance. have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra 
died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads 
chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common 
agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. 
. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150 b they have a 
distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK 
visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on 
transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the 
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and 
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that i would go back on my word I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. 
From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . 
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were 
discussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a 
detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not 
forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a 
discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three 
years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made 
a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they 
were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in 
writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and 
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp 
that only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I 
feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was 
never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to 
send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be 
owed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and 
overseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily 
discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement. I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023335 
left me felling quite uneasy. 
since you asked since last nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens 
drawer.. went through cash flows for phaidon shwoing that john murphy is not an accountant. redid your

questions you might ask your team ask them to provide a balance sheet or p&l for REgan arts. . doesnt exist 
ask. either wechsler or haperin to tell you what brh is, or how the tra works. . . ? as bronstein to tell you why

Last year you asked, for my help I told you I preferred not as we would be better off having no financial 
intereactions. the risk was not worth it. You told me that as my friend i had to do it I agreed., here we are 
in what I find to be an awkward situation. the transactions that i decvised were used , our agreement was 
ignored. and im not sure how to respond.

okay, its time for you to decide how you would like to move forward. ( fyi get your money from the 
1031 . the screw up is only one of many,) If you decide to move foward on decanting. phaidon, note basis 
estate update , each requires many carefully orchestrated detailed steps. and precision. there are hundreds of 
millions in saving if done correctly and a huge mess if not. If you want me and my colleagues to do it, 
oversee it paper it and guide it, you should tell me. It is a big undertaking. If not, ok .. Brad and your crew 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023336 
can do it. I will have no real further involvement apart from confirming the outcome of my proposed 
structure, I will not risk the admonition of- they thought you said, they thought you meant, they understood it 
to be. but they said you said, ( i e ,I asked at our meeting that accounting be done properly for bens house, 
what came back was ada thought that I meant that we needed to go back to the 97 trust and give him a full third 
party accounting of where his money had gone??!! I kid you not). I dont think brad should talk to jane heller 
without a fully fleshed out plan in place and even then it should be you.

1 fees, amount and to what entities when and responsiblitis. 2. gagosian idea to save a minimum of 10 
mill and maybe more. 3. i can walk you through carlyns screw up, 50 % would have made little difference 
and maybe made it worse. 4. we should have an all hands meeting with your family to talk about art 
distribution on death. . 5. phaidon, decantings ( already firmly in progress ) loans. ( alan ) pent. ( with 
follow up ) all part of same elegant transaction, 6 asymetric risk worth at least 50- 60 no matter how you 
calculate. I can explain. 7 lets get the money issue out of the way once and for all. I have my team set to 
start.

I had forgotten that Alan was actually at the table when i explained my note deal to you. it was at the end of 
the meeting described below. . as you will recall, not once , not even a peep did alan suggest 
contemporaneously his hand in the crafting, in fact brad said it was an idea. that HE brad, HAD HAD, from 
the begiining . my emails between alan and I that you can read, further confirm authorship. Im sure you recall 
the obnoxious tooting when alan said he agreed with my plan. .

I have mixed emotions about what transpired today. really, You saw first hand in nauseating detail what i 
have been saying to you for quite a while now. Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible, the charts he 
prepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I have recently gotten 
along quite well, I thought. Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar number. no cash flow 
after weeks of requesting? odd. when you suggested that heathers behavior was emblematic of a sloppy 
office , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay, admittedly no change for the year. . plane not 
done. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july . . I sent you a list of 10 consultantts. brad said 
three, . i didnt want to push it. I was shocked that brad was opining on things he knows little or nothing 
about. tax issues. 1031. neg basis, note payoffs ( the same idea he said he had had from the beggining??!!) 
. answers re LBF holdings that can be corrected ( they cant) . valuations that have never been read. . When 
we met in your lobby he seems surprised that i was there. I dont know if he felt somewhat sandbagged. . . 
the savings on the note payoff is aprrox 33 % of 1.8 billion, real money if you do phaidon which i see no 
reason not to . if later josh and ben want to buy it back with you or without you they can. i will walk you 
through the structure one on one. . the losses will offeset the calder gain as well as apollo gain. 
Im aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you. I felt badly for you. 
You wanted a contingent deal. real value. etc. I will not of course hold you to your deal . . its silly. its not 
how i work or a reflection of our friendship, my proposal is as follows. I want away from your buisiness , but 
at the same time leaving you in good shape. I think you should pay the 25m that you did not for this 
year. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are done. I will give 
you advice and counsel but new people will be running your operating machine. I will oversee all the work 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023337 
that needs to be done you and I will hire new people , and it will be self running. ( it was may in my house 
when you told brad it had been 5 months and you were getting fed up ) I will set up a parallel. office, somenoe
