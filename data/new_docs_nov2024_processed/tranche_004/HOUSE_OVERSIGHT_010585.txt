EBF1BEF68F5DE14BFB2CAA5C37E0. See Article attached hereto as Exhibit “X”.

51.  Edwards’s three complaints against Epstein contained less detail about sexual
abuse than (as one example) a complaint filed by attorney Robert Josephsberg from the law firm
of Podhurst Orseck. See Complaint, Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein (Exhibit “B”). As recounted in
detail in this Complaint, Jane Doe 102 was 15 years old when Ghislaine Maxwell discovered her
and lured her to Epstein’s house. Maxwell and Epstein forced her to have sex with both of them
and within weeks Maxwell and Epstein were flying her all over the world. According to the
Complaint, Jane Doe 102 was forced to live as one of Epstein’s underage sex slaves for years
and was forced to have sex with not only Maxwell and Epstein but also other politicians,
businessmen, royalty, academicians, etc. She was even made to watch Epstein have sex with
three 12-year-old French girls that were sent to him for his birthday by a French citizen that is a
friend of Epstein’s. Luckily, Jane Doe 102 escaped to Australia to get away from Epstein and
Maxwell’s sexual abuse.

52. Edwards learned that in addition to civil suits that were filed in court against
Epstein, at around the same time other attorneys engaged in pre-filing settlement discussions
with Epstein. Rather than face filed civil suits in these cases, Epstein paid money settlements to
more than 15 other women who had sexually abused while they were minors. See articles

regarding settlements attached hereto as Composite Exhibit “Y.”
