the accuracy of your publie statements?
MR. SCOTT: If it involves lawyer-client

BY MR. SCAROLA:
Q. You're refusing to answer?

not to answer. I would like to answer.

MR. INDYKE: Objection. This is Darren.

Anything that relates to your conversations

with Jeffrey --

THE REPORTER: He's going to have to speak
up.

MR. SCOTT: You're going to have to speak
up a little bit more, Counsel.

MR. INDYKE: Objection. This is Darren

Indyke. Anything that Alan might have to say

to that, to the extent they are covered under

conversations with Jeffrey Epstein, privileged

under attorney-client privileges as well as
common interest privileges.
MR. SCOTT: Do you understand?
THE WITNESS: I do.
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. To which your response was: Sure, sure,
certainly I have been his lawyer and J did speak to
him about it. I wanted to make sure that his memory
and mine coordinated about when I was at his island.
He was able to check. I was able to check. |
checked with my friends who went with me.

Did you make that answer to that question?

A. Yes.

Q. Disclosing the contents of your

254

1 want to know what the words making
something up out of whole cloth mean.

A. 1 said those words in the context of
Virginia Roberts.

MR. SCOTT: That's -- that's fine. Go
ahead.
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. What do the words mean?

A. That there was absolutely no basis for
Virginia Roberts' claim that she had any sexual
contact with me. That the story was entirely false.
I don't know where the metaphor derives about whole
cloth, but certainly that's the common
understanding. And I repeat under oath that
Virginia Roberts made up the entire story about

having sexual contact with me out of whole cloth.

Q. During the course of the same interview
that we have been referencing with Hala Gorani —~
for the record, that's H-A-L-A, G-O-R-A-N-I.

A. What page?

Q. Page 19.

You were asked: I'm wondering, have you

spoken to Jeffrey Epstein about this since these
allegations came out in this suit in the United
States? Have conversations happened there?

communication with Jeffrey Epstein, correct?

A. I disclosed that | had spoken to him to
find out whether he had any records of when | was on
his island. And, yes.

MR. INDYKE: Again, this is Darren Indyke.
Jeffrey does not waive any attorney-client
privileges here.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Well, the reason why you were able to
answer that question and discuss with the press what
Jeffrey Epstein was telling you was because you
weren't his lawyer at that time, right?

A. No, I was his lawyer at that time. I'm
still his lawyer.

Q. Oh, what were you representing him on
then --

A. The ongoing --

Q. -- that is, on January --

MR. SCOTT: Whoa.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. -- on January 5, 2015?

A. The ongoing --

MR. INDYKE: My objection stands.

MR. SCOTT: You can answer what you were
representing him on, | think.
