BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. And can you determine from the calendar
entries here where your wife is during the period of
time that's covered by these calendar entries?

A. I would have to look at a particular
entry. If it describes where she is, yes.

Q. Okay. Well, tell me where she is.

A. What day?

MR. SCOTT: Which one? What point?
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. The period covered by this calendar
between December 7 and December 13.

A. What year?

Q. You know what, I can't tell you what year
it is from these calendars. So you tell me.

I suggest to you that this is a calendar
from December of 2000, since the next two months at
the top of the calendar are January 2001 and
February 2001. So let's assume that since it is a
page from a calendar that appears to be December of
2000, that it's December of 2000.

That would be a reasonable conclusion,
wouldn't it?

A. [have no idea.

Q. You don't know?

December.

Q. One shows the subsequent two months and
the --

A. Okay.

Q. -- other one shows --

A. Yes.

Q. -- the preceding and following month,
correct?

A. Yes, that does look like it's December of
2000, yes.

Q. Okay, sir. So look at the calendar and
tell me where it appears your wife is during this

period of time.
A. The whole period of time?
MR. SCOTT: Picase read the exhibit, all
the pages, thoroughly, so that you have a full

context.
A. It says, A.D. in Boston. That means I was
in -- in Boston.

It says Charleston, New York. It says
book fair. It says book fair. It says A.D. in
Boston.

It then says the Halbrciches arrive.

They -- they were probably our gucsts.

A. I don't know. I mean, { don't know -- you
said you don't -- you can't tell what the year is,
so --

Q. Well, I'm telling --

A. -- [can't tell what the year is.

Q. -- you that it appears to be December 2000
because the next two months at the top of the

calendar are January of 2001 and February of 2001.

A. [only see -- I'm sorry, we're probably
looking at different things. [ see November 2000,
December 2000. [ don't see January or anything like
that. Maybe you can show them to me. Oh, it's on
the first page.

Q. First page, yes, sir.

A. So it's in reverse order.

Yeah, so the pages are in reverse order.
The first page says on top January 2001,
February 2001 and the second page says
November 2000, December 2000, yeah.

Q. So it appears we're looking at
December 2000, correct?

A. When we're looking at which page? When
we --

Q. Both pages.

Carolyn is. McDonalds -- let's see, this is 2000
and what year? 2001. 2000. Yeah, yeah.

So tell me what you're looking for. I'll
try to --

Q. I want to know where your wife was during
this period of time if you can tell from the
calendar entries.

A. Well, she may have been in -- there's
something about Charleston. There's something about
New York. There's something about me being in
Boston. | really can't tell much beyond that.

Q. Okay. So you don't know one way or
another from these calendar entries where your wife
was during this period of time; is that correct?

A. [can't tell that from this entry, no.

Q. What we can tell from the entry in the
bottom right-hand corner --

MR. SCOTT: Which page?
