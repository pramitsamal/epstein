A. Oh, 5:00 a.m., New York City, yes.

Q. Okay. Thank you, sir.

And the next page, where did -- where did

your wife have opera instructions?

A. Ihave no idea. We go to the opera in
Boston, we go to the opera in New York, we go to the
opera in Florida. We do a lot -- a lot of opera. I
don't know what opera instructions means.

Maybe it would be best if you asked my

wife about these things. It's her calendar.

Q. }--Lintend to, sir, but

. Well, no --

would do it by remote when I was in a different
city. And I clearly did some remotes for Court TV.

Q. In fact, you took an apartment in New York
for purposes of convenience to facilitate your
New York Court TV appearances, correct?

A. Totally false.

Q. Did you have an apartment in New York
during this period of time in December of 20007

been a reference to --

A. Ihave no idea.

Q. -- on this calendar page.

A. I just have no idea. I would be
speculating.

Q. During the same period of time on
December 12 when there's a calendar entry that
reflects 1:30, Jeff, we know from the flight logs

Palm Beach International Airport to Teterboro
Airport, which is the private plane facility that
services the New York Metropolitan area.

A. Ihave no idea.

plane. I haven't seen the flight log.

flight log. It's the next page.
