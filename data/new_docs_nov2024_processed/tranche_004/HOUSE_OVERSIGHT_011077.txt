Suppose for example that cash flow rate is known to be 4%. Using (7.2), we would

figure

1 100
years purchase = —_———— = yer oN 2 SO 525 years.
A%/year 4% 4/100 4.
That allows (7.1) to be reexpressed as
capital = (cash flow) x (years purchase). (7.3)

Where cash flow and cash flow rate are assumed constant over time, they become
identical to profit and rate of return. Sumerians realized that return is the universal
maximand, three millennia before Turgot wrote that down, and that competition
tended to equalize it to a current market norm. Then it would also equal years

purchase.

Petty was searching for the rationale of years purchase, and found it in the

generation length. Petty’s idea I think, and mine anyhow, could begin with

capital = means of accomplishing goals= means of lineage survival= fitness. (7.4)

Nature’s way is transmission of all fitness, meaning total capital for humans, to the
next generation. Nature cares just as much for later generations, but trusts each
generation of immediate descendants to know best what their own immediate
descendants will need for that long-range goal. Each passes the baton and retires.
We invest everything in the next generaton precisely because we care about the

ones after. Hamilton’s rule reflects this reality. Grandoffspring are only % related to
