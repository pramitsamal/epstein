trial to become a mini trial about whether or not he, for

calendars, his credit card receipts, his telephone records, all

of that. It gets into the issue, you know, obviously we have

another witness who says that they were in a similar

circumstance with respect to him. So it takes the trial away
from whether or not the allegations relating to Maxwell are
true or false and turns it into a trial about another
individual who we have not made a claim against who comes in.
There's also a problem with respect to that because he
