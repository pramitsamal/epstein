Re: Investigation of Jeffery Epstein
Dear Mr. Lefkowitz:

Pursuant to your request and the request of U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta, we have
independently evaluated certain issues raised in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein to determine

federal prosecution. We have discussed the factual and legal issues you raise with the Criminal
Division’s Appellate Section, and we consulted with the Office of Enforcement Operations
concerning the petite policy.

We are examining the narrow question as to whether there is a legitimate basis for the
U.S. Attorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein. Ultimately, the
prosecutorial decision making authority within a U.S, Attomey’s Office lies with the U.S.
Attommey. Therefore, to borrow a phrase from the case law, the question we sought to answer
was whether U.S, Attemey Acosta would abuse his discretion if he authorized prosecution in this
case.

As you know, our review of this case is limited, both factually and legally. We have not
looked at the entire universe of facts in this case. It is not the role of the Criminal Division to re-
conduct a complete factual inquiry from scratch. Furthermore, we did not analyze any issues _
concerming prosecution under federal Statutes that do not pertain to child exploitation, such as the
money laundering statutes,
