2.2 Commonly Recognized Aspects of Human-like Intelligence 21

The following list of key aspects of human-like intelligence has a better claim at truly being
generic and representing the consensus understanding of contemporary science. It was produced
by a very simple method: starting with the Wikipedia page for cognitive psychology, and then
adding a few items onto it based on scrutinizing the tables of contents of some top-ranked
cognitive psychology textbooks. There is some redundancy among list items, and perhaps also
some minor omissions (depending on how broadly one construes some of the items), but the
point is to give a broad indication of human mental functions as standardly identified in the
psychology field:

e Perception

— General perception

— Psychophysics

— Pattern recognition (the ability to correctly interpret ambiguous sensory information)
— Object and event recognition

— Time sensation (awareness and estimation of the passage of time)

e Motor Control

— Motor planning
— Motor execution
— Sensorimotor integration

e Categorization

— Category induction and acquisition

— Categorical judgement and classification
— Category representation and structure
— Similarity

e Memory

— Aging and memory

— Autobiographical memory
— Constructive memory
— Emotion and memory
— False memories

— Memory biases

— Long-term memory

— Episodic memory

— Semantic memory

— Procedural memory
— Short-term memory
— Sensory memory

— Working memory

e Knowledge representation

— Mental imagery
— Propositional encoding
— Imagery versus propositions as representational mechanisms
