mansion to be sexually abused. Reinhart had previously been an Assistant United States
sis in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida when Epstein was
being investigated criminally by Reinhart’s office. Reinhart left the United States Attorney’s

conspirators during the civil cases against Epstein. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at 411.
