86. Front in or about 2005, through in or about November 2009, Scott Rothstein
appears to have run a giant Ponzi scheme at his law firm of Rothstein, Rosenfeldt and Adler P.A.
(“RRA”). This Ponzi scheme involved Rothstein falsely informing investors that settlement
sepeemenits had been reached with putative defendants based upon claims of sexual harassment
and/or wihistle-blowt actions. Rothstein falsely informed the investors that the potential
settlement agreements were available for purchase. Plea Agreement at 2, United States v. Scott
W. Rothstein, No. 9-60331-CR-COHN (S.D. Fla. Jan. 27, 2010) attached hereto as Exhibit “SS.”

87. It has been alleged that among other cases that Rothstein used to lure investors
into his Ponzi —— were the cases against Epstein that were being handled by Bradley J.
Haman, Esq. Edwards had no knowledge of the fraud or any such use of the Epstein cases. See
Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at 99.

88. Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., joined RRA in about April 2009 and left RRA in
November 2009 — a period of less than one year. Edwards would not have joined RRA had he
been aware that Scott Rothstein was running a giant Ponzi scheme at the firm. Edwards left
RRA shortly after learning of Rothstein’s fraudulent scheme. Jd. at 48.

| 89.  Atno time prior to the public disclosure of Rothstein’s Ponzi scheme did Edwards
know or have reason to believe that Rothstein was using legitimate claims that Edwards was
prosecuting against Epstein for any fraudulent or otherwise illegitimate purpose. Jd. at 420.

90. Edwards never substantively discussed the merits of any of his three cases against

Epstein with Rothstein. See Deposition of Bradley J. Edwards taken March 23, 2010, at 110-16.

(hereinafter “Edwards Depo”) (Deposition Attachment #22).
