rules of professional responsibility. The Florida Bar investigated and dismissed the
complaint.

Affidavit. Each of the assertions concerning what I learned, what I did, and the good
faith beliefs formed by me in the course of my prosecutions of claims against Jeffrey
Epstein as contained in the Statement of Undisputed Facts is trus, and the foundations
set out as support for my beliefs are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

25. All actions taken by me in the course of my prosecution of claims against Jeffrey
Epstein were based upon a good faith belief that they were reasonable, necessary, and
ethically proper to fulfill my obligation to zealously represent the interests of my
clients.
