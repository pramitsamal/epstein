Now sitting in the plane, Julie looked out at the clouds as the wing cut past them, already thinking of
their next plans: to find a place in the mountains and ski all year long, using income from a sail-rigging
workshop to fund the slopes and more travel.

» LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION

I was done with driving across town to collect my son from child- care only to slide across icy
highways trying to get back to work with him in tow to finish my work. My mini-retirement brought us
both to live at an alternative boarding school full of creative lifestyle redesigning children and staff in a
gorgeous Florida forest with a spring-fed pond and plenty of sunshine. You can easily search for
alternative schools or traditional schools that might accept your children during your stay. Alternative
schools often see themselves as supportive communities and are exceptionally welcoming. You might
even find an opportunity to work at a school where you could experience a new environment with your
child.

Tim,
Your book and blog have inspired me to quit my job, write two e-books, sky dive, backpack through

South America, sell all the clutter in my life, and host an annual convention of the world’s top dating
instructors (my primary business venture, third year running). The best part? I can’t even buy a drink yet.

Thank you so much, bro!
—ANTHONY

please everybody all the time.
