ZEN AND THE ART OF ROCK STAR LIVING
Hi Tim,
Here’s the story. ’'m a musician based in Munich, Germany. ’'m running my own label and it has

been difficult to get it off the ground. While working on that, my creativity slowly decreased until I hit
rock bottom (a couple of times).

While it is still difficult to survive in the music industry I find it not hard at all now to do what I want
to do. And that’s all I do. I do what I want to do. It includes being a father, making music, composing,
taking care of business, traveling, learning languages (mostly Italian), riding my bike, etc.... It’s all in the

the longest). I outsourced:

o » research, most of which is music-industry related (research
outsourced saves about 2—3 hours/day)
