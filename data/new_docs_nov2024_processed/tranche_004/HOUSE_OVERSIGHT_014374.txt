= How to do M&A right: When describing acquisitions that most impressed the
panelists, a key reason for success was the acquirer keeping the target
management in place as well as giving the target management independence. The
scope and planning of the integration was also critical for success.

Understanding the Changing Fixed Income Markets

We hosted a panel to discuss the evolution of the fixed income market structure given
the advent of electronic trading and regulatory construct. Our panelists included Lee
Olesky (co-founder and CEO of Tradeweb), Adam Brown (Head of US Rates
Electronic Trading at BofAML) and Brian Callahan (Head of US Par Loan Trading
and the head of Electronic Initiatives for Global Credit and Special Situations at
BofAML).

= Electronification of fixed Income markets steadily growing; however, lag
European market. Electronic trading came to fixed income trading in the late
1990’s as a way of automating transactions (i.e. create a more efficient process
between parties}. Today in the US, the investment grade market is 16-20%
electronic, the high yield market is 8% (has doubled over the last few of years), the
treasury market (which has been growing steadily over last 10-15yrs) is 80-90% of
the actual trade count is electronic. While the electronification of the derivative
market was slower to evolve, recent regulatory reform has accelerated the
electronification process (50% today}. That said, while the evolution towards
electronification in the US continues to grow, the European bond market is actually
more advanced with nearly 50% of the bond market automated (vs. 20% for the
US).

= Regardless of possible regulatory relief, electronification may slow but won’t
end entirely. While a partial repeal or lightening of Dodd-Frank would be a net
positive for the financial markets, and possibly lower the costs to banks and end-
users, Mr. Brown doesn’t see a dramatic effect on the market structure. In other
words, regulatory relief may only slow down the electronification progress.

= Electronification within the fixed income market is a modest priority among
asset managers. Fifty-two percent (52%) of the audience polled believe it to be a
modest priority in their own corporate strategy to embrace new
technologies/electronification in fixed income. Mr. Brown was not surprised by the
results as many of the asset managers have their own constraints from technology
funding to regulatory issues to running the day-to-day business. While
