Automatic easing

Policy headwinds are also abating: for the first time since 2013, both fiscal and

monetary policy are poised to turn stimulatory in 2017.

Monetary policy: Bo) pegs to zero

The Bo)’s transition to yield-curve targeting ensures that real yields will drop as inflation

picks up, implying that financial conditions will turn increasingly loose as the recovery
progresses. There are good reasons to be cautiously optimistic: after all, despite a triple
whammy of weak domestic demand, weak commodity prices, and a stronger yen,
Japanese inflation measures are showing early signs of bottoming out (Chart 6).

We expect Japan-style core inflation (CPI ex fresh food) to trough in Q4 CY16, after
which it should accelerate relatively quickly in the first two quarters of 2017 in response
to 1) a recovery in crude oil prices, 2) a weaker yen (we assume USDJPY rebounds to
120 by the end of the year), and 3} stronger wage growth. This also implies stronger
core-core inflation (CPI ex food & energy). We are bullish on all three factors and see
CY17 core inflation running at an above-consensus 1.0% and 1.4% in CY18.

This is still short of the central bank’s 2% target (Chart 7). But we believe there will be
little pressure to lower rates further, especially against the backdrop of a weakening yen
and rising global yields. More broadly, things are moving in the right direction for the
Bo). The private sector has been steadily re-leveraging, albeit gradually. Meanwhile,
labor markets continue to tighten and wage growth is slowly improving: the 4-quarter
moving average for hourly wages is now up to 1.2% y-o-y (Chart 8). With the labor
market for lower-cost part-time workers nearing saturation, growth in higher-quality,
full-time jobs is picking up (Chart 9). We expect a moderation in employment gains and

faster wage growth ahead.
