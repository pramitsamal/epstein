Fiscal policy: turning looser In FY17

Fiscal policy is undergoing an equally important shift. In August, the Cabinet approved
an economic stimulus package totaling JPY28trn (roughly 5.5% of GDP). Though “real
water” government spending is a comparatively modest JPY7.5trn (1.5% of GDP}, this is
enough to put the fiscal impulse back in expansionary territory, after three years of
tightening (Chart 10). The stimulus measures, which are centered on public investment
and cash transfers to households, should boost CY2017 GDP by O.5ppt. Public
construction orders are already rebounding as the government front-loaded public
infrastructure spending (Chart 11). Meanwhile, the next stage of the consumption tax
increase has been postponed until October 2019.

To be clear, we are not talking about massive shifts in the fiscal stance here—the
Ministry of Finance remains very much opposed to expanding the deficit and Prime
Minister Abe has yet to abandon the government’s long-standing goal of balancing the
primary balance by FY2020.

However, there is a growing consensus among Japanese policymakers that premature
fiscal tightening is counter-productive for reflation efforts, especially when monetary
policy is stretched. Even Bo) Governor Kuroda, who initially underplayed the risks from
2014 fiscal tightening, has recently acknowledged that loose monetary and fiscal
policies will have a “synergistic effect.” The upshot is that the risk of another policy
error is low, in our view. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus in
the form of a third supplementary budget or relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget.
We would not rule out further delays to the October 2019 consumption tax hike, either.
