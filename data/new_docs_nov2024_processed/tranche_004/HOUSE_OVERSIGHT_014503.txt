ST. THOMAS — A massive op-
eration involving more than a dozen
armed local and federal officers —
while a helicopter circled overhead
— at Oswald Harris Court on Fri-
day evening yielded two marijuana
arrests.

Jose Squiabro, 42, and Yasim Ross,
31, both of Oswald Harris Court,
were arrested as a result of the opera-
tion, according to court documents.
Both were charged with possession
of marijuana with intent to distribute
and released Monday after posting
$10,000 bond each. Arraignment for
the two men is scheduled for Jan. 5.

Friday’s operation shut down the
housing community and caused
alarm for residents around Estate
Thomas, Long Bay and Centerline
Road.

More than a dozen armed officers
secured the intersection around Build-
ing 9 in the housing community as a
US. Customs and Border Protection
helicopter flew overhead. None of the
officers would say what they were do-
ing, but they were dressed in tactical

gear, some armed with long guns that
appeared to be semi-automatic rifles,
and officers wore body armor labeled
as being from the Drug Enforcement
Administration or police.

Probable cause affidavits filed
Monday against Squiabro and Ross
shed light on the operation, known as
“December Reign.”

The operation is a joint effort by
officers from Homeland Security In-
vestigations, U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Patrol, the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco, Firearms and Explosives, the
Drug Enforcement Agency, the Jus-
tice Department, and the VI. Police
Department. It is meant to patrol St.
Thomas housing communities, “due
to the recent increase in gun violence
in those areas,” according to the af-
fidavit for Ross.

At 4:45 p.m. Friday, officers ap-
proached a group of men around
Building 20 and noticed Squiabro
drop a partially smoked joint, accord-
ing to the affidavit.

Officers recovered the joint and
105 bags containing marijuana, ac-
cording to the affidavit. The affida-
vit does not note how large the bags
were or the total weight of marijuana

ST. THOMAS — Federal agents
arrested a crack cocaine dealer in
Red Hook on Saturday as part of
an ongoing investigation targeting
armed drug trafficking, according to
court documents.

Tolomah Foy was arrested and
charged with possession of crack
cocaine with intent to distribute, ac-
cording to an affidavit filed Monday
by a special agent with the U.S. Bu-
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms
and Explosives, also known as the
ATF.

The arrest came as a result of oper-
ation “Total Recall,’ an ATF initiative
on St. Thomas that began in August
and is ongoing, according to the af-
fidavit.

“This investigation focuses on the
armed drug trafficking fueling vio-
lence which has resulted in over 48

homicides to date,” according to the
affidavit.

Agents focused on armed drug
traffickers operating in Red Hook, a
commercial bar and restaurant dis-
trict frequented by a large number
of tourists, and have created cases
against 10 subjects for federal fire-
arm and narcotics violations so far,
according to the affidavit.

On Nov. 11, an undercover agent
made a cold contact with Foy, also
known as “T;’ who led the agent
behind Tap and Still and sold him
approximately 3 grams of crack co-
caine, according to the affidavit.

The agent exchanged phone num-
bers with Foy and called him on Nov.
14 to arrange another transaction out-
side the Fresh Mart Grocery store.

Foy asked the agent to instead meet
him behind Tap and Still, where he
sold him approximately 6 grams of
crack cocaine for $200, according to
the affidavit. On Nov. 17, Foy sold the

Similar to Squiabro’s arrest, at
about 5:50 p.m. Friday, officers ap-
proached Ross and other men near
the 1st Stop Gas Station in Estate
Thomas, which is located south of
Oswald Harris Court. When asked
whether he had any illegal substanc-
es, Ross said, “yeah I have a little
weed in my back pocket,” according
to the affidavit.

Officers found a total of 2.2 ounces
of marijuana packaged in various plas-
tic bags in Ross’ possession and arrest-
ed him, according to the affidavit.

Ross’s criminal history includes a
2003 arrest for third-degree burglary;
a June 2009 arrest for delaying and
obstructing; a Sept. 2009 arrest for
first-degree robbery, possession of a
dangerous weapon, and unauthorized
use of a vehicle; and he was arrested
in January and charged with destruc-
tion of government property.

disposition” for each of Ross’s prior
arrests.
