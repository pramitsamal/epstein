» Virginia Roberts reveals she is 'Jane Doe 102’ in Jeffrey Epstein case

+ Mother-of-three spent four years as millionaire's personal masseuse

- She describes being flown across world to meet Prince Andrew

« Epstein trained her ‘as a prostitute for him and his friends’

As the UK's special representative for international trade, the Duke of York holds an important
position, requiring sound judgement and widespread respect.

But those qualities have been thrown into question since photographs of Prince Andrew with his
billionaire financier friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child-sex offender who was jailed for 18
months for soliciting underage prostitutes, appeared last weekend.

Today, however, even more serious doubts are cast on his suitability after a woman at the centre of
the Epstein case revealed to The Mail on Sunday that she had, as a 17-year-old employed by
Epstein, been flown across the world to be introduced to the Prince.
