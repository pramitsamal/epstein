LONDON, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies the 4 Googie’ play
various allegations about her

that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations
are all entirely

false.

Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine

, TYORS, PRNE
RCH g. 2044

It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell's legal
representatives to certain newspapers pointing out the truth Ee
and asking for f.-Linda Craft

the allegations to be withdrawn have simply been ignored. © 41016-569-3956 MOBILE

In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take
legal action against those newspapers.

I understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is
well known that certain newspapers live by the adage, “why
let the truth get

in the way of a good story.” However, the allegations made
against me are

abhorrent and entirely untrue and I ask that they stop,” said
Ghislaine

Maxwell.

Record call

“A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of
accuracy

in their reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the
most

elementary investigation or any real due diligence. Iam now
taking action to

clear my name, she said.
