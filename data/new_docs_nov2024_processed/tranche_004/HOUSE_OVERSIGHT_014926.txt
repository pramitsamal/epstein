Our PO of $15 is based on a 3.5x 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We note that 3.5x is roughly
in line with the lead generation peer group average 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We think
our EV/Sales multiple is warranted as a balance between Trivago's higher growth and
lower profitability. Our price objective is supported by our DCF analysis.
