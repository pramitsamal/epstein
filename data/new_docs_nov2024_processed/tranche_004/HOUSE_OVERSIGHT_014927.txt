Wayfair (Neutral, $44 PO)

Stock view: Timeline on profitability still an issue, but comps ease in 2Q’17
Wayfair’s two issues have been deceleration in U.S. revenue growth and negative
operating margins as the company continues to aggressively invest in logistics,
international expansion, marketing, and new categories. 1Q customer and order growth
comps remain tough, which was one of the drivers of revenue growth guidance below
expectations. Wayfair also attributed weak guidance to caution on the retail
environment and added investment. Growth comps ease in 2Q/3Q, and there is potential
for more stable growth in 2Q guidance to drive improving investor sentiment.

As for margins, management guided to EBITDA margin of (3.5%)-(3.8%), a deceleration
from (2.8%) in 1Q’16 due to a lower opex absorption in the quarter on seasonally lower
sales. The US is expected to swing back to EBITDA losses in 1Q’17, while Intl losses are
expected to remain steady. We forecast EBITDA margin of (2.4%), with (0.2%) EBITDA
margin in the US and (19.0%) margin in International. The company continues to expect
little to no ad spend leverage given increase International ad spend.

Management historically builds conservativism into its guidance and, until last year, had
a track record of beating the upper end of its sales outlook by ~10%. Recently, revenue
has been by a low-single digit percentage. Our above consensus 1Q revenue forecast
implies 1% upside to the high end of the guidance range, in line with the trend over the
past 3 quarters. We think investors expect sales growth above the guidance range as
well.

Over the past two quarters, Wayfair has expressed caution on the macro environment,
though this proved to be somewhat unwarranted in 4Q. According to February 2017
aggregated BAC credit and debit card data, furniture sales were up 1.3% (down 0.4% on
rolling 3-month m/m basis), while home goods were down 1.2% y/y and flat on a rolling
3 month m/m basis. Please see the BofA Merrill Lynch US Economics team's report for
additional commentary on broader retail trends and a detailed explanation of the
methodology and limitations in connection with BAC data. Williams-Sonoma reported
disappointing 4Q earnings (March 15* report) and provided modest 1Q guidance that
the BofA Merrill Lynch Hardline Retail team called “a little rich,” though it is difficult to
tell if weak trends are the result of secular home goods weakness or the disruptive
impact of eCommerce players like Wayfair.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: 2Q revenue guidance on easier y/y comps

1Q revenue guidance was a disappointment, though comps ease in 2Q’17, and
opportunity for more stable US growth could aid stock sentiment. Customer growth in
2Q has a 400bps easier y/y comp vs 1Q17, while order growth has a 1700bps easier y/y
comp. Overall, revenue growth faces a 1600bps easier y/y comp. and would expect
guidance anywhere near the Street’s 2Q estimate at 25% y/y growth to be viewed
positively given several quarters of guidance below street estimates.
