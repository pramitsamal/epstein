¢ Metrics could remain under pressure: Investors likely will look for stabilization in
key metrics such as app unique devices growth and local ad account growth, but it
could take time for incremental marketing and sales investments to bear fruit.

« Stock comp could create overhang: With Alphabet’s decision to only report GAAP
profits, Yelp’s high stock comp (67% of 2017E EBITDA) could create overhang to
the valuation.

Leading indicator data points:

Salesforce growth decelerating

While it possible that Yelp sees improving productivity per salesperson, and the mix shift
to national and self-serve reduces reliance on direct sales, the deceleration in salesforce
headcount is a negative leading indicator for revenues.

Accrued sales bonus and commissions tracking lower

We note that 4Q accrued bonuses and commissions are down y/y and reflect only 0.3%
of NTM revenue, which would be the lowest ratio seen in recent years. Even on an
absolute basis, the total accrued bonuses and commissions of $3.1mn is the lowest
since mid-2013. While this is likely due in part to gains in self-serve and perhaps
increased sales focus on National accounts, the change is noteworthy, in our view.
