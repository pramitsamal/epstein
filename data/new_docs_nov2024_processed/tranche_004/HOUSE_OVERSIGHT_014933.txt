In addition, the y/y change in commissions expense disclosed in company filings
continued a downward trend to negative territory. Over the course of 2016, the number
has gone from +$5.7mn in 1Q16, to +$2.4mn in 2Q16, to +$1.4mn in 3Q16, to down
$1.7mn in 4Q16.

We also consider comScore mobile data, which indicated that US monthly active users
were up 2% y/y (2-months data) while desktop monthly active users were down 14%
y/y. This reflects a moderate deceleration in mobile from 4Q (+4%) and slightly lower
declines in desktop (4Q at -16%). Total QTD US minutes are down 6% y/y for mobile (vs
+4% in 4Q), though App minutes were flat, and desktop was up 6% y/y (vs +1% in 4Q).
The somewhat weaker mobile minutes trend is notable, particularly the lack of growth in

Estimates vs Consensus

Our revenue and EBITDA estimates are slightly above consensus for both 1Q17 and
2Q17, as well as for 2017 and 2018. We expect local ad revenue to grow 28% y/y in 1Q
(vs 36% in 4Q) and transaction revenue to grow 17.5% (vs 19% in 4Q). Our 2017
estimates are near the high end of management’s 2017 outlook, and we would expect
any upside potential to likely surface in the latter half of the year.

We are more constructive on the stock given more negative sentiment and recent sell-
off, but maintain our Neutral rating given the decelerating sales leading indicator
metrics and tougher revenue comps. Our $43 price objective is based on 14x 2018E
EV/EBITDA, slightly above online media comps, which we believe is warranted given the
higher margin potential in the model. We believe our multiple balances premium growth
vs peers with medium-term concerns on competition and limited GAAP profitability. We
believe the slight premium valuation is sustainable if the company can continue to
deliver 20%+ y/y topline growth, which would be above the advertising industry.
