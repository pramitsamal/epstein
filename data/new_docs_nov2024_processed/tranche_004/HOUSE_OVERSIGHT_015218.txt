swinging is the answer. To them, cheating is not an issue, unfaithfulness is
obsolescent, and adultery is merely a concept that deprived former Air

The Lifestyles Convention provides a nurturing environment for
these couples the same way a convention of crossword-puzzle enthusiasts
or barbed-wire collectors would provide for those folks. Yet, in the case of
swingers, one is left with a puzzle. Is impersonal intimacy an oxymoron? |
ask that question of psychologist Stella Resnick, sex therapist and author
of 7he Pleasure Zone. Her reply:

“We can’ t put a value judgment on this. These are all consenting
adults. It doesn’ t really matter that it’ s rather impersonal because they
are in long-term relationships, so they’ re getting their intimacy needs
met, but not necessarily their needs for excitement in sex, and this is
certainly a way to do it. Often they are sexually identified in the sense that
they’ re sexual people, they have strong desires, they’ re not necessarily
into politics or other causes, but this is a good cause—being in the body,
being healthy—and it’ s a way of relaxing and enjoying their bodies.
Whatever turns you on, as long as you’ re not doing any damage to

anybody else and you’ re taking care of yourself, fine, enjoy.”
