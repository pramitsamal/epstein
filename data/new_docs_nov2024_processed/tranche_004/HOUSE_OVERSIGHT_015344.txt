like to pass along--they can be largely eliminated with, of all things, Visine
eye drops. But pubic hair is practical; serves as a cushion against friction.

The porn industry has played an important part in shaping pubic
styles. Jordan Stein writes in an article titled Has Porn Gone Mainstream?:

‘Consider the near icon status the female porn star has achieved. She is
sO mainstream that even good girls are imitating her various styles of
undress, disappearing hair and all. Porn chic? You bet.”

However, Julia Baird writes in Celebrity Porn. “The idea that the
fashion industry can strip, then exhibit women in the name of ‘porn
chic,’ is a bit silly, frankly. But ‘flesh is the new fabric’ could be the new
catch-cry. Americans call their bush George W. It’ s fashionable--the
curious fact is that it is fueled by the porn aesthetic that celebrities love to
love.”

Among Hollywood actresses, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kirstie Alley have
both admitted favoring Brazilian wax jobs, where most of their pubic hair is
removed, leaving a small tuft that remains hidden under a thong bikini.
Sara Jessica Parker’ s character, Carrie Bradshaw, had her pubic hair
removed during the third season of Sex /n the City. Presumably, it’ s now
in the Smithsonian museum along with Archie Bunker’ s easy chair and

the Fonz’ s leather jacket.
