On ABC’ s Women’ s Murder Club, a medical examiner directs her
gaze to the crotch of a female corpse and says, “That’ s not your
mama’ s bikini wax. On 7he View, Joy Behar said, “No pubic hair
creates a wind tunnel.” And in a hysterical episode of HBO’ s dark
comedy series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, former Se/nfe/d producer Larry
David performed oral sex on his wife, and in the process he sort of
swallowed one of her pubic hairs. The next day, he was still choking on it,
like a cat trying to get rid of a hairball.

A psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of Survival of
the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty, Nancy Etcoff, writes that “There’ s
also an erotic, sexual component to hairlessness because your skin is more
sensitive when it’ s more exposed. Women today are emulating porn stars
who have no pubic hair, and | think men like it.”

My own resistance to the plethora of bald pussies stems from my
pre-adolescent days when pubic hair was such a big taboo that | became
obsessed with it. In those pre-bikini days, | would go to Coney Island and
stroll around the sand, sneaking glances at ladies in the hope of finding a
few stray curlicues of forbidden pubic hair peeking out from their various
and sun-dried crotches. And if | was able to discover any, why, it felt as

though | had experienced a really productive afternoon.
