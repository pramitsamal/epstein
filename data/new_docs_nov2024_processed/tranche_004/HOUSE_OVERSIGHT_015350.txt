sperm because it’ s a good source of protein, something that’ s often
lacking when meat is removed from the diet.

Finally--and this could possibly be an urban legend--in a biology
class at Harvard University, a professor was discussing the high glucose
levels found in semen which give the spermatozoa all that energy for their
journey. A female freshman raised her hand and asked, “If | understand
you correctly, you’ re saying there is a lot of glucose, as in sugar, in
semen?”

“That’ s correct,” replied the professor.

The student asked, “Then why doesn’ t it taste sweet?”

“It doesn’ t taste sweet,” he answered as she realized what her
question implied. She blushed, picked up her books and headed for the
door, as he continued, “because the taste buds for sweetness are on the

tip of your tongue and not the back of your throat. Have a good day.”
