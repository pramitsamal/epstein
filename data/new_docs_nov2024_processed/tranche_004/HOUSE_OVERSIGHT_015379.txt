Remembering George Carlin

George Carlin died in June 2008. He was a generous friend. When |
performed in Los Angeles, he sent a limousine to pick me up at the airport,
and | stayed at his home. And such a sweet man. When | opened for him
at the Warner-Grand Theater in San Pedro, we were hanging around in his
dressing room, where he was nibbling from a vegetable plate. | watched as
he continued to be genuinely gracious with every fan who stopped by. If
they wanted his autograph, he would gladly sign his name. If they wanted
to be photographed with him, he would assume the pose. If they wanted
to have a little chat, he indulged them with congeniality.

| said, “You really show respect for everybody.”

“Well,” he responded, “that's just the way / would want to be
treated.”

As a performer, Carlin was uncompromising, knowing that his
audience trusted him not to be afraid of offending them. In fact, he was
excited by that possibility. The day before one of his live HBO specials, he
called and told me to be sure and watch it, because he would devote the

first ten minutes of his performance to the subject of abortion.
