Diehl: “I was hoping you hadn’ t seen it, Robin. It’ s said of you in
Hollywood that you don’ t read your scripts. Anyway, ladies and
gentlemen, I’ d like to bring you Robin Williams, fresh from C/ub Paradise,
his biggest failure yet.”

Williams: “Thank you, Gary Franklin [the movie reviewer Diehl

Smith references. That’ s some funny stuff.”

Robin confessed, “I really don’ t know Harlan for shit,” then
described his house. “ It’ s like Notre Dame done by Sears. There’ s
Harlan, naked, playing in his toys with a beautiful shiksa goddess jumping
up and down saying, ‘I like him. He’ s smart.’  Robin morphed into a

little boy in the bathroom. “I'’ m reading Bradbury, dad.” (Roaster Ray
