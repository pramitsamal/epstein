he had decided to run for president, and he wanted to know if | thought
Bob Dylan would make a good vice president.

“Oh, sure, but to tell you the truth, | don't think Dylan would ever
get involved in electoral politics.”

Gregory would end up with assassination researcher Mark Lane as
his running mate. Next, | called Jerry Rubin in New York to arrange for a
meeting when we returned.

At our counter-convention we all attended an Unbirthday Party for
President Lyndon Johnson at the Coliseum, with Ed Sanders, leader of the
Fugs, serving as emcee. The atmosphere was highly emotional. Dick
Gregory recited the Preamble to the Declaration of Independence with
incredible fervor. Fists were being upraised in the audience as he spoke,
and | thrust my own fist into the air for the first time.

When my marriage broke up in 1971 | moved to San Francisco and |
had my own talk program. Gregory announced on my show that, until the
war in Vietnam was over, he was going to stop eating solid foods. | in turn
announced that, until the war was over, | was going to eat all of Dick
Gregory's meals. Actually, my only rea/ discipline was being silent one day

a week.
