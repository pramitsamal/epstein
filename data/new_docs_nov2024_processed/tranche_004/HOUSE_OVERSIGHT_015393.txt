When my young daughter Holly came out to stay with me that
summer, she decided to join me on my silent day. We communicated with
handwritten notes. Holly wrote, Does /aughter count? Since we were
making up the rules as we went along, | answered, Yes, but no tickling.
Naturally she tried to make me laugh, but | held it in - and got a rush.

All the energy that normally gets dissipated into the air with
laughter seemed to surge through my body instead. | decided to stop
laughing altogether, just to see what would happen. The more | didn't
laugh, the more | found funny. And, paying closer attention to others, |
refined my appreciation of laughter as another whole language that could
often be more revealing than words. Sometimes | would get a twinge of
guilt if | nearly slipped and laughed, and | remembered what | had always
known, that children must be taught to be serious. When | mentioned my
laugh-fast to Dick Gregory, still on his food-fast, it didn't sound so far-
fetched to him.

That's two things people do out of insecurity,” he said. “Eating
and laughing.”

“Well, what would happen to us if everyone in our audiences
realized that?”

“Brother, we'd go out of business.”
