remind somebody else to pass a joint, you lose your own turn.” Since
Bogart and Lauren Bacall were a classic Hollywood couple, | was inspired
by that snippet of dialogue to say, “Don’ t baca//that joint.”

4. Intuitively, | was an advocate of equal rights and opportunities for
both genders long before Women’ s Liberation became a movement. In
1959, | wrote, “From a completely idealistic viewpoint, classified ads for
jobs should not have separate Male and Female classifications, with
exceptions such as a _ wet-nurse.” In 1964, that practice became
illegal. Masturbation was a powerful taboo for females, a subdivision of
the war on pleasure, while it was somehow expected of males. But if it was
okay for guys to jack-off, | wrote in a media fable, 7a/es of Tongue Fu, in
1974, then it was also okay for girls to jill-off.

5. In 1979, | covered for a weekly alternative paper the trial of ex-cop
Dan White for the double execution of San Francisco Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the gay equivalent of Martin Luther
King. In a surprise move, homophobic White’ s defense team presented a
bio-chemical explanation of his behavior, blaming it on compulsive
gobbling down of sugar-filled junk-food snacks. This was a_ purely
accidental tactic. Dale Metcalf, an attorney, told me how he happened to

be playing chess with one of White’ s attorneys, Steven Scherr.
