On top of that, my name was on a list of sixty-five “radical”
campus speakers, released by the House Internal Security Committee. The
blacklist was published in the New York Times, and picked up by
newspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my

campus speaking engagements stopped abruptly.

When | was assigned to write a piece for the Los Angeles Times, |
titled it “| Was a Comedian for the FBI,” because | mentioned that | had
once recognized a pair of FBI agents taking notes while | was performing
at the Community Church in New York. My FBI files later stated that |

“purported to be humorous about the government.” Since when did

taxpayers provide the funds to cover the FBI’ s theater critics squad?

The banner headline on the cover of that LA. 7imes Sunday
Calendar section blared out: Paul Krassner-- “1 Was a Communist for the
FBI.” \|n the San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen wrote,
“Fearing Krassner would sue, the 7imes recalled and destroyed some
300,000 copies at a cost of about $100,000. Krassner would have laughed,

not sued.” Or maybe | would've sued and laughed my ass off.
