RE: Edwards adv. Epstein
291874

DATE: April 07, 2011

JS: Virginia, Jack Scarola and Brad Edwards

BE: Hi Virginia.

V: Hi Jack! Hi Brad! How you guys doing?

JS: | We’re doing fine, thank you. I’m sorry for all of the trouble and before we go any
further, let me tell you, if I have your permission, I have started a tape recorder and I
want to be able to tape this conversation from the very beginning. Is that alright with
you?

V: Sure, that’s fine, Jack. No problem

JS: | Ok, good, thank you. I appreciate that. Let me start off by introducing myself. I know
that Brad has spoken to you about me but I am Brad’s lawyer, and I assume that you can
confirm that you and I have never had any communication before. Is that right?

V: That’s correct.

JS: Alright. I have, however, gotten some information from Brad about conversations that
you have had with him, and that will enable me, hopefully, to make this a little bit more
efficient and take up a minimum amount of your time while still getting the information
that we think is going to be helpful to us and to any jury that might ultimately have to
hear these facts.

So, let me begin by asking you first to tell us what your full name is.

V: Virginia Louise Roberts. That’s my maiden name. My married name is Virginia Louise
