IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
SEVENTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN
AND FOR BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA

CASE NO.: CACE 15-000072
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and PAUL G.
CASSELL,

PLAINTIFFS/COUNTERCLAIM DEFENDANT EDWARDS AND
CASSELL’S RESPONSE TO DERSHOWITZ’S MOTION TO DETERMINE
CONFIDENTIALITY OF COURT RECORDS

Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, by and
through their undersigned attorneys, hereby file this response to Dershowitz’s Motion to
Determine Confidentiality of Court Records. The records at issue are not confidential, and so the
Court should deny Dershowitz’s motion in its entirety.

The court records at issue are three court filings by attorneys Edwards and Cassell
in which they recite their client’s (Mr. Virginia Giuffre’s) allegations that she was sexually
abused by Dershowitz. These records are hardly “confidential” in this defamation case,
where the parties have claims and counterclaims about these sexual abuse
Allegations. Rather, these records are an important part of this case, since they not only
support the conclusion that Dershowitz abused Ms. Giuffre, but also indisputably establish
Edwards and Cassell’s strong basis for filing the allegations on her behalf. Moreover,
contrary to assertions made in Dershowitz’s motion, these documents have never been

found to be “confidential” by any other court. And Dershowitz has repeatedly referred to
