Functional PET

PET

The last scan we will look at is functional positron emission tomography,
or f-PET. In this machine the scanner detects positrons given off by
excited oxygen atoms.

As you think, you burn glucose by combining it with oxygen.
The parts of the brain that are thinking hard use a great deal of oxygen
and this shows up in scans. Again the consecutive slice trick is used to
generate a 3D image that allows you to fly through the brain as it works

There is one problem common to all these methods. X-rays, MRI
and PET scans only show us the location of thoughts with an accuracy
of a few millimeters. Each pixel in the image contains around 10 million
neurons, so we can't see the details of thought. For a scale comparison it
