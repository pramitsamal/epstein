Thinking

“We cannot solve our problems
with the same thinking we used
when we created them.”

Albert Einstein

is normal. Mental work takes energy. Scientists estimate the brain
consumes 20% of our resting energy; around 12 watts. Physical fitness
is important for thinking. If you get out of breath running for a bus,
thinking is going to be harder for you. Studies are mixed about whether
the additional work involved in solving a difficult problem causes you to
use more energy. We certainly see an increase in the flow of glucose to
the appropriate part of the brain, but the overall energy use in the brain
is quite high in the first place, so it is hard to see the incremental effect.
Unlike muscles, which store energy locally as glycogen, brain cells
‘burn’ glucose and oxygen from the blood stream in real time. If scientists
detect glucose and oxygen flowing to a part of the brain they know it
must be working on a problem. As we know, there are several ways to
make glucose and oxygen show up in brain scanners. You can, therefore,
inject someone with the right chemical markers, wheel them into a brain
scanner, and watch them learn new skills. On a practical level, there
is limited space within a scanner and you can't wield a golf club, for
example. Julien Doyon, a researcher at the University of Montreal, was
recounting this problem to a friend and she suggested knitting. Knitting
is a physical activity you learn just like a golf swing or a tennis stroke, with
all the initial fumbles and jerky activity, settling down to a fluid learned
skill. Most experienced knitters can engage in a full conversation while
knitting complex patterns, only needing to break off and concentrate
during a pattern change. Luckily, there are ceramic and bamboo knitting
