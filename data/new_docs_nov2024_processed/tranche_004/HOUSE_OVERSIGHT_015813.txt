The Brain 123

Paramecium

DNA into its two complementary strands when a cell divides. In single-
celled organisms, including paramecium, the ends of the tubes stick out
of the body and form the cilia that drive the organism along.

The presence of tubulin in complex, single-celled organisms
provides a clue that the smallest information processing unit might not
be the neuron. Some single cell organisms, such as paramecium, display
complex behavior: hunting for prey and escaping danger. This suggests
they can process small amounts of information without the need for a
matrix of neurons. Since we evolved from these organisms, why wouldn't
our brain cells take advantage of this sub-cellular intelligence?

The structure of tubulin lends itself to digital processing as the
molecules forming the walls have two stable states and can flip between
them. We might recognize this as the basis of a binary computer, and
cells might have little computers within them. They would not need to
process many bits to be useful. Perhaps single-cell organisms developed
information processing capabilities in their micro tube structures that
allowed them to better survive and, as their nervous systems evolved, they
coupled these structures to form the brains we see today. This piece of
theory is not too controversial. After all, nerves have wiring within them
to carry information to the synapses and it’s likely this wiring is involved
in the thinking process. But Hameroff is not finished. He has teamed up
with Roger Penrose to bring quantum mechanics into the picture.
