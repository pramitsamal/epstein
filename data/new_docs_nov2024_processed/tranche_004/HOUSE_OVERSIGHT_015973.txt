reasons. First, most people see no need for super-Turing thought. They
believe computers are sufficient. Second, they believe the brain is not a
hospitable place for quantum effects: it is too hot and too chaotic. Indeed,
until recently people assumed quantum effects would have no place in
biological entities, but this orthodoxy has recently been overthrown by
the discovery of quantum processes in photosynthesis. The paper by
Travis Craddock of Nova and others suggests there may also be quantum
structures in the neurons of our brains and we might possess quantum
computers after all. But, remember, Penrose and Hameroff don't only
need quantum coherence within our brain to explain consciousness.
They also need gravitational effects.
