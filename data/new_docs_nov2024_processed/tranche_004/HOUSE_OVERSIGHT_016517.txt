group), and favoritism toward the class of perpetrators, law enforcement officers. 4° In the ordinary organization of criminal
justice systems, those cases call on officials from one law enforcement agency to assess the evidence against officials from
another, even when the agencies regularly work together. +! As in the context of local public corruption, conflict-of-interest

rules 42

are far from adequate to prevent prosecutors from making judgments in light of such professional relationships and
circumstances. 43 The possibility of partiality is inevitable. When [*857] that possibility combines with the long history of
racial disparities in U.S. criminal justice administration, widespread suspicion of non-prosecution decisions in cases of police

violence against minority civilians is hardly surprising, as the Black Lives Matter movement demonstrates. “4
4. Other Underenforcement Contexts

Corruption, sexual assaults, and police violence illustrate the key causes and effects of failures to enforce criminal law, but the
same forces are recognizably at work in other social contexts. Scholars and advocates have pointed to biases as explanations for
inadequate law enforcement responses to offenses against undocumented aliens, sex workers, institutionalized persons, and
targets of anti-LGBT hate crimes. * Complaints that police ignored wrongdoing against racial-minority victims in minority
communities were prominent in the 1970s and 1980s. 4° Some of [*858] the remedies, however - which included harsher
drug laws adopted with substantial support from African American politicians and communities - have proven deeply
problematic for those same communities. 47

Finally, less pernicious biases and favoritism are suspected explanations for lenient enforcement patterns in lower-visibility
contexts, such as bicyclists killed by motor vehicle drivers, ** employees injured on the job due to workplace safety violations,
and bystanders shot by recreational hunters. +? Even critics of those enforcement decisions in those settings view them as
products of subtle or unconscious empathy with vehicle drivers, employers, and recreational gun users, which incline officials

40 Prison guard assaults on inmates raise the same concerns, although they get less public attention. For a notorious failure to prosecute
prison guards and law enforcement officials for unjustified lethal force, see generally Heather Ann Thompson, Blood in the Water: The Attica
Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy (2016).
