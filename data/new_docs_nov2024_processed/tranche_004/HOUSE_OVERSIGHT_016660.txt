FLORIDAN AQUIFER PLANT ISSUES

é Floridan Aquifers can be used for both Aquifer Storage
and Recovery and source water

é Potential increased energy costs associated with lifting
water and impacts to adjacent users

é Potential for decline in water quality over time

~ Some pumping wells become saltier (up-coning of

more saline water from below or laterally along coast)
~~ Membrane design and periodic replacement
~ Blending with Surficial Aquifer water

é Estimated 125% of raw water to meet treated water
demands

@ Concentrate disposal via deep injection well
