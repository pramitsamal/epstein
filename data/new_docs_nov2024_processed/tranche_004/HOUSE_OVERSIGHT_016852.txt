The roboticist Rodney Brooks, featured in Errol Morris’s 1997 documentary Fast,
Cheap and Out of Control along with a lion-tamer, a topiarist, and an expert on the
naked mole rat, was described by one reviewer as “smiling with a wild gleam in his eye.’
But that’s pretty much true of most visionaries.

A few years later in his career, Brooks, as befits one of the world’s leading
roboticists, suggested that “we overanthropomorphize humans, who are after all mere
machines.” He went on to present a warm-hearted vision of a coming Al world in which
“the distinction between us and robots is going to disappear.” He also admitted to
something of a divided worldview. “Like a religious scientist, I maintain two sets of
inconsistent beliefs and act on each of them in different circumstances,” he wrote. “It is
this transcendence between belief systems that I think will be what enables mankind to
ultimately accept robots as emotional machines, and thereafter start to empathize with
them and attribute free will, respect, and ultimately rights to them.”

That was in 2002. In these pages, he takes a somewhat more jaundiced, albeit
narrower, view; he is alarmed by the extent to which we have come to rely on pervasive
systems that are not just exploitative but also vulnerable, as a result of the too-rapid
development of software engineering—an advance that seems to have outstripped the
imposition of reliably effective safeguards.
