Netanyahu and the Arab spring

Abdel-Moneim Said

9 - 15 June 2011 -- Two regionally and globally crucial spectacles
have been unfolding in the Arab world this year. The first is the wave
of revolutions, or uprisings, or whatever they might be called that
have variously overthrown regimes, striven to overthrow others, and
made yet others so uncomfortable that not a day goes by without
them announcing various reforms.

The second spectacle originated in Washington, where US President
Barack Obama has launched his latest initiative to kickstart a new
Palestinian-Israeli peace process based on the two-state solution
defined by the 1967 borders, albeit modifiable by land swaps in order
to accommodate the concrete changes that have taken place over the
past 44 years.

What happened next will be familiar to all: Israeli prime minister
Binyamin Netanyahu went to Washington, furious at Obama's
announcement. In spite of the fact that both leaders addressed the
American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Obama's speech
being conciliatory while Netanyahu remained inflexible, the bridge
between the two leaders remains fragile. However, to complete the
picture, there is a need to refer as well to Netanyahu's speech to the
joint houses of Congress, also made during his recent visit to
Washington.

The standing ovation Netanyahu received there was a palpable
reminder of how deeply Israel has worked its way under America's
skin and that no differences between the two seem ever likely to ever
spoil their intimacy.
