driver. All these are now gone, or very much diminished. While there
are intellectually convincing new rationales for the project, including
the rise of non-Western giants such as China, rationales are no match
for emotional motivators. The key to so much of this, especially on
the economic side, is Germany. For much of its history, what has
become the European Union pursued political ends by economic
means. For Kohl and Mitterrand, the euro was mainly a political
project, not an economic one. Now the boot is on the other foot. To
save a poorly designed and overextended monetary union, the
political must ride to the rescue of the economic. That will require
Angela Merkel's leadership. If we are talking about the European
economy and currency, Germany is the indispensable power. Only
the combination of Germany and the European Central Bank,
working in unison, has a chance of calming the mighty markets.

For more than a year now, Merkel has attempted to find the narrow —
perhaps nonexistent — line where the minimum that can be done to
save the embattled Eurozone periphery meets the maximum she
thinks German public opinion will bear. She has then tried to win her
Eurozone partners to that course. So far, it has not worked. Now she
needs to start from the other end: Work out, with the central bank and
other Eurozone governments, what is the best, most credible deal
available, and then put all her authority on the line to convince a
reluctant German public that this is in the long-term, enlightened
national self-interest of Germany. And it is. For no one has more to
lose from the disintegration of the Eurozone than the Continent's
central economic power. It may soon be too late.
