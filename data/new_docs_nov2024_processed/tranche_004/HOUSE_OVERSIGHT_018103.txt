What Would War with Iran Look Like?

Jeffrey White

July - August 2011 -- The debate over what to do about an Iranian
Islamist regime apparently bent on acquiring nuclear weapons has
been on or near our front burner for at least six years, and is now
almost a settled feature of the policy landscape. There is general
agreement in the United States on two points. First, an Iranian
nuclear weapons capability is “unacceptable’’, as both the Bush and
Obama Administrations have put it; and second, we prefer getting to
an acceptable outcome without using force. The debate gets testy
when we consider that means short of force, such as sanctions and
covert technical sabotage, might not work.

It may be too simple to reduce the argument to just two sides—those
who fear the regime’s acquisition of nuclear weapons more than the
consequences of a war to prevent it, and those who fear the
consequences of a war above all else—but in this case simplicity has
the virtue of capturing the essence as observers ponder which set of
unpalatable risks they would rather run. What is remarkable, though
hardly surprising, is that the two sides usually put forth very different
assessments of what using force would entail. Those who fear Iranian
nukes above all else tend to minimize the risks of using force, while
those who fear war tend to exaggerate them. Neither side, however,
has persuasively spelled out the reasons for their assessment, leading
one to suspect that much of the argument rests on less than rigorous

What would an honest assessment of the risks of military conflict
with Iran look like? How should we think about it? These are difficult
questions even for those who are not partisans of one side or the
