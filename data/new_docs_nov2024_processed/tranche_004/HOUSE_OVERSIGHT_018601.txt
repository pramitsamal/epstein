+ 5 large GARLIC CLOVES, finely chopped
+2 BAY LEAVES

+ 1 inch fresh GINGER, finely chopped
+ 1/2 inch CINNAMON STICK

+ 4 CLOVES

+ 4 PEPPERCORNS

+ 1 CARDAMOM POD

+ 2 pounds TOFU

+ | tablespoon GROUND CORIANDER
+ 1 teaspoon GARAM MASALA

+ | teaspoon GROUND CUMIN

+ 1/2 teaspoon CAYENNE PEPPER

+ 1/2 teaspoon GROUND TURMERIC
+ 14 ounces CANNED TOMATOES

+ SALT to taste

+ 2/3 cup SOY YOGURT

Heat OIL in large, heavy-bottomed sauce pan.

Add ONIONS, GARLIC, GINGER, BAY LEAVES, and WHOLE SPICES; fry gently on
medium heat until sauteed.

Add the TOFU, and fry until the pieces are lightly golden brown on all sides. (Here are
some tips on frying tofu so it has a light crust.)

Stir in CORIANDER, GARAM MASALA, CUMIN, CAYENNE, TURMERIC,
TOMATOES, and SALT. Cook for a while (10 minutes works).

Add SOY YOGURT and cook for another while.

As a general rule, the longer you cook a spicy dish like this, the spicier it'll be.

KOK ok
