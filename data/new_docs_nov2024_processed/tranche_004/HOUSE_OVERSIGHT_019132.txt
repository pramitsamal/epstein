“we're here to see Jeff,” says Wendy.
The guard nods— of course you are—and leads them to the

side door.

They're in the kitchen now. Mary, Wendy, some middle-aged
man. The man has a long face, bushy eyebrows, and thick silver
hair—and he’s fit. As fit as the jocks that Mary goes to school
with, Not attractive, exactly. He’s way too old for that. But confi-
dent, in a way that makes an impression.

Standing behind the man there’s a woman. She’s blond, very
pretty, much taller than Wendy.

What a strange scene, Mary thinks. She can’t shake the feeling
that the man is studying her. Then he nods, and he and Wendy
walk out of the kitchen. A little while later, they're back.

“Sarah,” the man says to the tall woman. “You can take Mary

upstairs.”

Sarah takes Mary up a wide winding staircase carpeted in pink.
Together they walk down a hall that’s got photographs on the
wall—naked women. Long curtains cover windows and don't
let in much light. In the air, there's a strong lavender fragrance.

Then they come to a room containing a green-and-pink sofa.
There’s a large bathroom off to one side and doors on either side
of the sofa. There’s a wooden armoire with sex toys on it. There’s
a massage table, too, and a mural of a naked woman.

“wait here,” says Sarah. “Jeff will be up in a moment.”

Mary’s too freaked out to do anything else. Fidgeting with

her belt loops, she sits on the sofa, jumps up again.
