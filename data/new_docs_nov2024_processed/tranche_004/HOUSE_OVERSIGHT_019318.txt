The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In
short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in
the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because
the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and
published in the scandal book “Fire and Fury”. “Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,”
Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise.
Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The “army of darkness” is
already among us.
