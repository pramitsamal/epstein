ever did before [Snowden].”

If Snowden could cause such massive damage, so could other civil-
ian trainees at the NSA. Someone in the chain of command had to
take responsibility. General Alexander tendered his resignation on
June 30, 2013. “I’m the director,” he said, falling on his sword. “Ulti-
mately, I’m accountable.” Because President Obama did not want
the head of the NSA resigning in the midst of the Snowden crisis,
he asked him to stay on for another six months. He then appointed
Rogers to be his replacement. Meanwhile, it had become undeni-
ably clear to the review committee appointed by President Obama in
2013 that the NSA’s own defenses had catastrophically failed. If so,
this change was the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs on the
Titanic after it hit the iceberg.
