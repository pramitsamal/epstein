the U.S. exercise, including deliberately “trapping” him in Moscow,
was to “demonize” him. “There was no question that I was going
to be subject to a demonization campaign.” Snowden said in Mos-
cow, “They [Greenwald and Poitras] actually recorded me on camera
saying this before I revealed my identity.” Snowden asserted this
“demonization” was to divert attention from the government’s own
crimes. By providing Snowden with this platform to rail against the
putative machinations of the United States, Putin laid claim to the
moral high ground.

Snowden’s motive in requesting documents from other foreign
intelligence services, such as the GCHQ, and copying lists of NSA
sources remains unexplained. It is difficult to believe that his motive
was whistle-blowing, because these documents were not among
those he gave to journalists in Hong Kong. Indeed, he did not pro-
vide the journalists with the lists of sources that were particularly
relevant to the NSA’s surveillance of Russia. His legal represen-
tative in Moscow, Kucherena, confirmed that Snowden had taken
secret “material” to Russia and had access to NSA documents that

© he had not given to journalists. Those unrevealed documents would ©
be prized by many an adversary service. Did he use those documents
as leverage in his transformation? The role that Moscow might have
played in Snowden’s defection clearly requires a closer examination
of the machinations that brought Snowden to Russia. That is why I
visited Moscow in October 2015.
