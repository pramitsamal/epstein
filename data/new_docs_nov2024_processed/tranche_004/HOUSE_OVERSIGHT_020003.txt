According to CNN, “Iwo former senior U.S. officials quickly dismissed Trump’s
accusations out of hand. ‘Just nonsense,’ said one former senior U.S. intelligence official.”
Inside the White House, the “just nonsense” quote was thought to be from Ben Rhodes,
offered in cat-that-swallowed-the-canary fashion.

Ryan, for his part, told Priebus he had no idea what Baier was talking about and that he
was just BSing through the interview.

But if tapping Trump’s phones wasn’t literally true, there was a sudden effort to find
something that might be, and a frantic White House dished up a Breitbart article that
linked to a piece by Louise Mensch, a former British politician who, now living in the
United States, had become a kind of conspiracy-central of the Trump-Russia connection.

There was a further effort to push aggressive incidental collection and unmasking back
onto the Obama White House. But in the end, this was another—and to some quite the
ultimate—example of how difficult it was for the president to function in a literal,
definitional, lawyerly, cause-and-effect political world.

It was a turning point. Until now, Trump’s inner circle had been mostly game to defend
him. But after the wiretap tweets, everybody, save perhaps Hope Hicks, moved into a state
of queasy sheepishness, if not constant incredulity.

Sean Spicer, for one, kept repeating his daily, if not hourly, mantra: “You can’t make
this shit up.”
