¢ The US government should not unilaterally grant Chinese think-tank or university
scholars ten-year visas, as it has been doing, without exacting across-the-board
reciprocal treatment for US think-tank and university scholars. At the same time,
the US government should also advocate consistently on behalf of US think-tank
and university scholars who have been barred from visiting China.

Two core values cut across all of our concerns: freedom of speech and reciprocity. As a
democratic society, we should tolerate no infringements—overt or covert—on our
freedom of speech and freedom of analysis concerning China. A “leveling of the
playing field” in terms of upholding the principles and practicalities of reciprocity in
our exchanges with Chinese counterparts is needed, because it is an essential part of
making the relationship both more equitable and reciprocal and more stable and thus
durable.
