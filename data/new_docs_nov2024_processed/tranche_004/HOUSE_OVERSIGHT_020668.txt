The three men — Alexei Ananenko (second left) and soldiers Valeri Bezpalov (center) and Boris Baranov (far right) —
risked their lives o drain the fluid near the reactor during the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster in Pripyat, Ukraine in 1986.
After the plant’s water-cooling system failed and a pool formed under the reactor 10 days into the disaster, there was a
high risk that the lava-like radioactive substance could melt through the barriers and drop the reactor’s core into said

pool, causing a steam explosion. Luckily, the men were able to drain the fluid and spectacularly, all three survived.
