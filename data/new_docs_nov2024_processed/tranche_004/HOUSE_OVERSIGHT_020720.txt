Sometimes, when the days get too gray and gloomy, you need a little pick-me-up before you can carry on, something that
would make you smile. Artist Valerie Minelli and her comic series about life aim to do just that. “If I can make one person

cheer up reading them, it’s a success,” claims the author of the drawings.

Despite the fact that they are drawn in black and white, the little illustrations are warm and quirky. Short and honest, the
comics should make your day a little brighter and maybe even remind you a little bit of yourself. Scroll down to read them

and check out our other comics about everyday life here and here.
