Defense Spending Is The Second-Largest Expense Item After

Entitlements, But Below Long-Term Trend as Share of GDP

¢ With budget deficits rising, some advocate cutting back on defense spending, the
second-largest expense item after entitlements.

¢ Defense spending has risen substantially in recent years, due to the wars in
Afghanistan and Irag, and other costs related to the Global War on Terror. As a
percentage of GDP, however, defense spending in the U.S. remains below its 60-
year trend.

¢ On an inflation-adjusted basis, U.S. defense spending is at its highest level since
World War Il. With overhead ~40% of all spending, the Defense Business Board
found DoD consistently pays “more for less” and fails to attack overhead as the
private sector would.1

¢ The Esquire Commission to Balance the Federal Budget, a group of four former
Republican and Democratic senators, found over $300 billion? in defense
restructuring opportunities, and other analysts proposed gradual cuts to reduce
the defense budget by 14% by 2018. 2
