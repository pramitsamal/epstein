Think About That...

e USA per capita healthcare spending is 3x OECD average, yet the
average life expectancy and a variety of health indicators in the US
fall below average.

e But if you spend way more than everyone else, shouldn’t your
results (a.k.a. ‘performance’) be better than everyone else’s, or at
least near the top?

e Should you examine sources of waste/inefficiency given lower
output despite greater input?

e Definition of ‘Performance’ = Amount of useful work accomplished
given certain amount of time and resources.

e Definition of ‘Efficient’ = Obtains maximum benefit from a given
level of input of cost, time, or effort.

unfunded entitlement.
