Social Security: In Good Shape Now, Yet Challenged in Future

by Aging Population

e Social Insurance Program Created in 1935 — During height of the Great
Depression to help elderly (65+*) and disabled people avoid poverty.

e Pay-as-You-Go Funding — Social Security taxes deducted from current payrolls
to pay out to current eligible recipients of Social Security.

e For Most of its 8 Decades (1935-1970; 1985 - 2009), Annual Social Security
Payments Have Been Funded by Annual Social Security Taxes — However,
based on estimates from Congressional Budget Office (CBO), beginning in 2016
(or earlier), Social Security will begin running an annual deficit as payments
exceed taxes (at unchanged flat tax rate of 12.4%' of annual gross wages) — this
is a problem!

e Social Security Has Been Struck by Annual Deficit Crisis Before — From
1975 to 1981, Social Security expenses exceeded revenue every year, which
caused a 45% reduction in the Social Security Trust Fund balance. Legislation
recommended by the Greenspan Commission in 1983 reduced average benefits
by ~5%? and raised social insurance tax rates for individuals by ~2.3%.? But the
Greenspan Commission fix will run out soon as Social Security turns to operating
loss in 2016.

Note: *Early retirees (62+) could receive partial benefits between 62 and 65. 1) 6.2% taxes paid by employees and matched by employers on gross wages up to

but not exceeding the Social Security wage base of ~$100K; 2) total benefit cuts included $27B savings from benefit taxation for the wealthy and $66B savings

from delay in cost of living adjustments over 1984-1989; 3) average increase in entitlement payroll tax rates between 1982 and 1988, includes Medicare payroll

KP taxes, per estimates from CBO. Source: Social Security Administration.
