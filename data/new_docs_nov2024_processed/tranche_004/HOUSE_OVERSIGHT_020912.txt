Heretofore, Social Security and Unemployment Insurance
have been effectively funded, but two significant entitlement
programs (Medicaid and Medicare) were created without
effective funding plans / programs. Only one of these
(Medicaid) is means-tested (indicating that one is eligible for
Medicaid only if he / she does not sufficient financial means).

Left unchanged, Unemployment Insurance funding should
improve as economic growth resumes, but Social Security will no
longer be self-funded within 5-10 years, and the underfunding of
Medicaid and Medicare will simply go from bad to worse.
