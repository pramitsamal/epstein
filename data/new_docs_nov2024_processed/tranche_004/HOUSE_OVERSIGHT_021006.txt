Start with the Basic High-Level Math —

Review Government Cost Structure

Government (federal + state + local, including military)
spending per household has steadily risen to 82% of
median post-tax household income, up from 51% in 1967.

Federal spending (ex. entitlement + interest payments +
one-time items) per household has remained flat since
1967, while entitlement + interest payments + one-time
items spending per household rose 3x.

Including federal, GSE, state and local (excluding military)
employees, there is one public worker for every six households
in the country, unchanged from 1967 or 1980 levels.

Note: *Real spending adjusted for inflation, in 2005 dollars. Source: Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis.
