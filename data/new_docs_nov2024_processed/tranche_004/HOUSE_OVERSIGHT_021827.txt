became a professor at the University of Utah; is that
correct?

A. Yeah I was professor -- excuse me -- before I
was a professor in the evening hours while I was a judge
from 2002 to 2007. And then I resumed full time
teaching at the University of Utah in around November of
2007 when I left the bench.

Q. Okay. And since you've left the bench, have
you also been affiliated with a law firm?

A. Yes.

Q. Could you tell me what that affiliation is
what --

A. Sure. I'm a special counsel with Hatch James
and Dodge. It's a law firm, small boutique litigation
law firm in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I occasionally do
cases with them.

Q. Is it fair to say that since 2007, since
resigning as a judge, you've been engaged at least on a
part-time basis in the practice of law?

A. Yes.

Q. And, in particular, in one of the cases
that's at issue here, what has been referred to as the
underlying CVRA case; you're familiar with that case?

A. Yeah. Let me be clear just the juxtaposition

of the causes, the CVRA case is not through Hatch James
