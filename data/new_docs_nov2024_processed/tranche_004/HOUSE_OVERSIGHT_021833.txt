Q. I'm just going to ask you questions about
the case and about your knowledge, and all I ask is that
you give your best answers based on your knowledge.

A. And all I ask is, if you're going to ask any
questions touching on those communications and I get a
chance to take a look at the subjects addressed in those
communications --

Q. If I ask you a question that you need to look
at something that you've never seen before to answer,
why don't you let us know?

A. Okay. Will do.

Q. What is your understanding of the ethical
responsibility of an attorney in signing a pleading to
be filed in Federal Court, and let's say in the Southern
District of Florida, if that's any different than

elsewhere?

A. Sure.
Q. Just give me your understanding.
A. Sure. The obligation is to make sure that it

is a good-faith pleading based on the facts and the law
as the attorney understands them, and consistently with
the obligation of the attorney to zealously represent
the position of his client.

Q. Okay. Would you agree with me that it would

be unethical to use pleadings for an improper purpose,
