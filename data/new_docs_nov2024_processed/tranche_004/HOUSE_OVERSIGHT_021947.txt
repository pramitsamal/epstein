A. Did I personally do that?

Q. Yes.

A. No. To my knowledge, I've never met
Mr. Josefsburg, so no.

Q. To your knowledge, did anyone else in the
group of attorneys you were working with ask
Mr. Josefsburg that question?
MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. To the extent that
that question would call for a communication
within the common interest privilege, you should
not answer it.
THE WITNESS: I'm going take my counsel's
advice. I can't answer that.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. You're not going to answer whether to your
knowledge anyone asked Mr. Josefsburg?

A. Right.

Q. But you are testifying that the fact that
Mr. Josefsburg had signed a complaint with a generic
term academicians in it was some evidence, in your
mind, against Professor Dershowitz?

A. Yes, because he's an academician and shortly
after the complaint was filed, a partner in his firm
began asking Alan Dershowitz questions about the sex

abuse matter that we are discussing here.
