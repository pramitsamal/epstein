Feedback & Comments

“Tam truly delighted that you and others have started publishing such a journal as Inference,
which touches on so many of my own concerns and interests - I have been meaning for years to
write articles on evolutionary theory (some like the fine ones you’ve already published); on big
data and its discontents (I have one on the deep troubles with deep learning); on the sloppy
connectome neuroscience (which you’ve covered); and so on - in fact, many of the topics on your
“hit list”. Your abbreviations alone are priceless.”

world.”
