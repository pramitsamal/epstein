“Thank you very much for the information about your journal and the link to David Lobina and
Mark Benchley's review of Tom Wolfe's book. I have taken a look at the title of the articles you

“T have gone through the edited version of the book review. There were a lot of changes made,
but I think you managed to keep most of my ideas and condense it in the editing process. Please
pass along my thanks to David and the other editors for the editing/co-writing.”
