“Tt seems to me that Ellis’ criticism of my response is rather dishonest. He quotes part of a
paragraph, and then attacks it (“Wrong...”) on precisely the grounds that I addressed in the
sentences following the part he quoted, which he ignores. Nevertheless, I’m glad to see this
debate playing out in a serious publication (rather than on blogs etc).”

“Inference continues to have terrific stuff: Please tell the editors that what is being published in

interesting.”
