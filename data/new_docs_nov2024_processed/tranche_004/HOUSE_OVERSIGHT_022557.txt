SEC’s Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by
Companies

SEC’s framework for evaluating cooperation by com-
panies is set forth in its 2001 Report of Investigation Pursuant
to Section 21 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Commission Statement on the Relationship of Cooperation to
Agency Enforcement Decisions, which is commonly known
as the Seaboard Report.”* The report, which explained the
Commission’s decision not to take enforcement action
against a public company for certain accounting violations
caused by its subsidiary, details the many factors SEC consid-
ers in determining whether, and to what extent, it grants leni-
ency to companies for cooperating in its investigations and
for related good corporate citizenship. Specifically, the report
identifies four broad measures of a company’s cooperation:

e self-policing prior to the discovery of the miscon-
duct, including establishing effective compliance
procedures and an appropriate tone at the top;

e self-reporting of misconduct when it is discovered,
including conducting a thorough review of the
nature, extent, origins, and consequences of the mis-
conduct, and promptly, completely, and effectively
disclosing the misconduct to the public, to regula-
tory agencies, and to self regulatory organizations;

e remediation, including dismissing or appropriately
disciplining wrongdoers, modifying and improv-
ing internal controls and procedures to prevent
recurrence of the misconduct, and appropriately
compensating those adversely affected; and

* cooperation with law enforcement authorities,
including providing SEC staff with all informa-
tion relevant to the underlying violations and the
company’s remedial efforts.

Since every enforcement matter is different, this ana-

lytical framework sets forth general principles but does not

SEC’s Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by

Individuals

In 2010, SEC announced a new cooperation program

for individuals.” SEC staff has a wide range of tools to

facilitate and reward cooperation by individuals, from tak-

ing no enforcement action to pursuing reduced sanctions in

connection with enforcement actions. Although the evalu-

ation of cooperation depends on the specific circumstances,

SEC generally evaluates four factors to determine whether,

to what extent, and in what manner to credit cooperation

by individuals:

the assistance provided by the cooperating indi-
vidual in SEC’s investigation or related enforce-
ment actions, including, among other things: the
value and timeliness of the cooperation, including
whether the individual was the first to report the
misconduct to SEC or to offer his or her coopera-
tion; whether the investigation was initiated based
upon the information or other cooperation by the
individual; the quality of the cooperation, includ-
ing whether the individual was truthful and the
cooperation was complete; the time and resources
conserved as a result of the individual's coopera-
tion; and the nature of the cooperation, such as the
type of assistance provided;

the importance of the matter in which the indi-
vidual provided cooperation;

the societal interest in ensuring that the cooperat-
ing individual is held accountable for his or her
misconduct, including the severity of the individ-
ual’s misconduct, the culpability of the individual,
and the efforts undertaken by the individual to

remediate the harm; and
