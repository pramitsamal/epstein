Not later than one year after August 23, 1988, the Attorney General,
after consultation with the Commission, the Secretary of Commerce,
the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of State, and the
Secretary of the Treasury, and after obtaining the views of all interested.
persons through public notice and comment procedures, shall deter-
mine to what extent compliance with this section would be enhanced
and the business community would be assisted by further clarification of
the preceding provisions of this section and may, based on such determi-

nation and to the extent necessary and appropriate, issue—

(1) guidelines describing specific types of conduct, associated with
common types of export sales arrangements and business contracts,
which for purposes of the Department of Justice’s present enforce-
ment policy, the Attorney General determines would be in confor-

mance with the preceding provisions of this section; and

(2) general precautionary procedures which issuers may use on a vol-

untary basis to conform their conduct to the Department of Justice’s

present enforcement policy regarding the preceding provisions of this
section. The Attorney General shall issue the guidelines and procedures
referred to in the preceding sentence in accordance with the provisions
of subchapter H of chapter 5 of Title 5 and those guidelines and proce-
dures shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 7 of that title.

(e) Opinions of Attorney General

(1) The Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate depart-
ments and agencies of the United States and after obtaining the views
of all interested persons through public notice and comment pro-
cedures, shall establish a procedure to provide responses to specific
inquiries by issuers concerning conformance of their conduct with the
Department of Justice’s present enforcement policy regarding the pre-
ceding provisions of this section. The Attorney General shall, within
30 days after receiving such a request, issue an opinion in response
to that request. The opinion shall state whether or not certain speci-
fied prospective conduct would, for purposes of the Department of
Justice’s present enforcement policy, violate the preceding provisions
of this section. Additional requests for opinions may be filed with the
Attorney General regarding other specified prospective conduct that
is beyond the scope of conduct specified in previous requests. In any
action brought under the applicable provisions of this section, there
shall be a rebuttable presumption that conduct, which is specified in a
request by an issuer and for which the Attorney General has issued an
opinion that such conduct is in conformity with the Department of
Justice’s present enforcement policy, is in compliance with the preced-
ing provisions of this section. Such a presumption may be rebutted by
a preponderance of the evidence. In considering the presumption for
purposes of this paragraph, a court shall weight all relevant factors,
including but not limited to whether the information submitted to
the Attorney General was accurate and complete and whether it was
within the scope of the conduct specified in any request received by
the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall establish the pro-
cedure required by this paragraph in accordance with the provisions
of subchapter II of chapter 5 of Title 5 and that procedure shall be

subject to the provisions of chapter 7 of that title.

(2) Any document or other material which is provided to, received by,
or prepared in the Department of Justice or any other department or
agency of the United States in connection with a request by an issuer
under the procedure established under paragraph (1), shall be exempt
from disclosure under section 552 of Title 5 and shall not, except
with the consent of the issuer, be made publicly available, regardless of
whether the Attorney General responds to such a request or the issuer

withdraws such request before receiving a response.

(3) Any issuer who has made a request to the Attorney General
under paragraph (1) may withdraw such request prior to the time the
Attorney General issues an opinion in response to such request. Any

request so withdrawn shall have no force or effect.

(4) The Attorney General shall, to the maximum extent practicable,

provide timely guidance concerning the Department of Justice’s
