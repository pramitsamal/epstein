(“As the premier financial development institution in Africa, the

AfDB is determined to root out misconduct, fraud and corruption
within its own ranks as well as in the implementation of the projects

it finances. In order to do so, the Bank created an anti-corruption and
fraud investigation division in November 2005 as its sole investigative
body. The unit became operational in June 2006 and commenced
investigations in January 2007. ... Investigations conducted by the
IACD [Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department] are not criminal
proceedings; they are administrative in nature. Sanctions range from
personnel disciplinary actions, such as separation, to loan cancellation
and debarment for contractors, which can be temporary or permanent.”),
