Development in Silos

As interesting and important as Huntington’s work was, it lay outside
of mainstream thinking about development, which from the start was
a highly Balkanized academic field that was dominated by
economists. Few scholars have sought to understand development as
an inter-connected process with political, economic and social parts.
Development economists looked primarily at economic factors like
capital, labor and technology as sources of economic growth, and
thought neither about the consequences of growth for politics nor the
relationship of political institutions to growth. The Harrod-Domar
growth model that was dominant in the 1950s suggested that less-
developed countries were poor primarily because they lacked capital,
which then led development agencies like the World Bank to try to
kick start growth with generous infusions of capital for physical
infrastructure. It was only when steel plants and shoe factories in sub-
Saharan Africa went idle due to corruption or lack of organizational
capacity that they were forced to go back to the drawing board.

The political scientists, for their part, scaled back their ambitions
from large Huntingtonian-style theory and focused primarily on
political phenomena. Beginning in the 1980s, there was increasing
interest in the problem of transitions into and out of democracy; with
democratic transitions in Spain, Portugal and nearly all of Latin
America, this became a particularly pressing issue. There was some
revival of interest in the democracy-development linkage, but it never
led to a clear consensus on the causal links connecting the two
phenomena.

The academic interest in transitions corresponded to the burgeoning
of democracy promotion as a distinct field of international practice,
both on the part of the United States and of other democracies around
