Iran will not hinder plans for a nuclear-

free world

April 17 2011 -- Two years ago this month in Prague, President
Barack Obama proposed steps to advance the goal of “a world
without nuclear weapons”. In the 24 months since, we have laid the
foundation for these next steps in arms control. But now new action
is needed.

The record so far is strong. The new Start treaty with Russia will see
the lowest level of deployed nuclear weapons since the 1950s. The
UN Security Council has imposed unprecedented sanctions on Iran
and North Korea for failing to meet their obligations. And enough
nuclear materials for hundreds of weapons have been removed,
secured or eliminated around the world.

Now, to end illegal nuclear programmes and stop proliferation, we
will maintain pressure on both Iran and North Korea. Iran, in
particular, is trying to exploit the changes sweeping across the
Middle East. But the hypocrisy of claiming to support reform in other
countries while suppressing it at home is obvious for all the world to
see. Some believe that the changes in the region will increase Iran’s
influence. In fact the opposite will happen: in a Middle East where
more citizens determine their own destiny, Iran will be increasingly
isolated by its actions.

Elsewhere, we will work to secure the world’s vulnerable nuclear
materials within four years, and use a new international fuel bank to
ensure that the use of nuclear energy does not lead to proliferation.
We will also seek to bring the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty into
