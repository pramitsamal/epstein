nuclear weapons, fail to follow up the destruction of the Syrian-North
Korean clandestine weapons program with tough, punitive sanctions
against Syria and North Korea? Their having been caught in flagrante
delicto should trigger consequences beyond just the destruction of the
clandestine facility.

Supporters of global zero sometimes argue that because we support
it, other countries will be readier to help us confront Iran and North
Korea. The idea seems to be that our support for eliminating all
nuclear weapons makes it easier for, say, our European and Pacific
allies to align themselves with robust anti-proliferation policies. The
argument would be interesting if there were evidence to support it—
but there is none. And there has been all too little backing for robust
anti-proliferation policies anyway. There has been no observable
difference in the readiness of other countries to pressure Iran or North
Korea since Obama, who supports global zero, became president,
compared to the help we got when George W. Bush, who did not
support global zero, was in office.

Tough, effective measures to slow the spread of nuclear weapons are
required—not utopian, solipsistic notions about how American
disarmament is the key to world peace. It isn’t. And the sooner we
reject measures that won’t work, the sooner we may find ones that do.

Richard Perle is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute. He served as assistant secretary of defense for international
security policy from 1981 to 1987 and afterward as a member of the
Defense Policy Board, including three years as chairman.

[1] I believe the high regard in which Shultz, Kissinger, Perry, and Nunn are
held is well deserved. In their long and extraordinary careers, they have each
made important contributions to American and international security. We are
all in their debt.
