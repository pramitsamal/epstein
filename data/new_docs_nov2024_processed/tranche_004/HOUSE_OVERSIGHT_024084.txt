CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The following is a brief summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be
relevant to an investment in the Fund. This summary does not contain a comprehensive
discussion of all U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a Partner in view
of that Partner’s particular circumstances or (unless otherwise indicated) to certain Partners
subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws — such as regulated investment
companies, personal holding companies, brokers or dealers in securities, banks and certain
other financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, trusts, and insurance companies — nor
does it address any state, estate, local, foreign, or other tax consequences of an investment in the
Fund, except as otherwise provided herein. This summary is based on the assumptions that (i)
each Partner (and each of its beneficial owners, as necessary under U.S. federal income tax
withholding and backup withholding rules) will provide all appropriate certifications to the
Fund in a timely fashion to minimize withholding (or backup withholding) on each Partner’s
distributive share of the Fund’s gross income and (ii) each Partner will hold its Limited Partner
Interest in the Fund as a capital asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each prospective
investor should also note that, except as otherwise provided herein, this summary does not
address the interaction of U.S. federal tax laws and any income or estate tax treaties between the
U.S. and any other jurisdiction.

No assurance can be given that the IRS will concur with the tax consequences set forth below.
Each prospective investor is advised to consult its own tax counsel as to the specific U.S.
federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Fund and as to applicable foreign,
state, estate, and local taxes.

General Matters

Classification of the Fund - Pursuant to applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, the Fund will be
treated as a partnership, rather than a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless
the Fund affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation for such purposes. The General
Partner has no intention of making such an election on behalf of the Fund and does not
anticipate any circumstances under which such an election would be made. In certain cases
under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a
partnership that is classified as a “publicly traded partnership” may be taxed as a corporation
