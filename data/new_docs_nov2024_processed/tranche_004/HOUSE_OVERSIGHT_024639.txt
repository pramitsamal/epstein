The U.S. State-Legal Cannabis Market

The legal landscape for the cannabis industry in the United States continues to be character-
ized by conflict between federal prohibition and the steady advance of state legalization. Accord-
ing to federal policy, Americans can access tobacco, alcohol and prescription drug products that
kill thousands each year, but they cannot access cannabis because it is a dangerous drug with no
currently accepted medical application in the United States (notwithstanding the federal gov-
ernment holds a U.S. patent for methods of treating diseases with cannabinoids). Meanwhile,
46 U.S. states have enacted at least one law that permits the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing or
possession of cannabis or concentrates. These laws fall into three general categories:

¢ 29 U.S. states (and the District of Columbia) have enacted medical cannabis laws that permit
the production and possession of cannabis or concentrates for use in treating a broad range of
qualifying medical conditions,

¢ 19 U.S. states have enacted narrow CBD/limited laws that permit possession of small amounts
of low-THC/high-CBD cannabis concentrates for use in treating a few serious medical condi-
tions—in particular, severe forms of childhood epilepsy.

* 8 USS. states have enacted recreational laws that permit the commercial production and sale of
cannabis to adults for recreational and other uses.

The following map of the United States shows states with medical cannabis laws, CBD/limited laws
or recreational laws (a state with more than one of these laws is represented on the map by its most
permissive law).
