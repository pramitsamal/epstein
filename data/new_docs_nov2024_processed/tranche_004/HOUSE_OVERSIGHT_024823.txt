COWEN’S COLLECTIVE VIEW OF CBD

In a collaboration featuring 11 analysts across Cowen’s consumer, health care,
industrials and regulatory teams, herein we offer our outlook for the global CBD market,
with a particular focus on the U.S. While little science exists supporting medical efficacy
of CBD (with the exception of seizures, which GWPharma was able to prove with
Epidiolex for Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, as discussed in more
detail herein), the popularity of CBD products seems to be growing exponentially in the
U.S. Indeed, our consumer survey work suggest that close to 7% of adults in the U.S.
already use CBD as a supplement.

With the category gaining increasing interest from consumers we have seen a swell in
product innovation. And, the opportunity is increasingly drawing the attention of larger
competitors (where for instance, WEED announced that they would consider spending
as much as $500 mm in U.S. hemp / CBD). By 2025, we estimate that the U.S. CBD
market could approach $16 bn (from $600 mm -S2 bn in 2018}.
