Cronos Group / Ginkgo Bioworks (September 2018; Valued Up to $122MM)

2

Cronos Group is a vertically integrated Canadian cannabis company that operates two
licensed producers. In addition, the company has developed an assortment of cannabis
varietals and has amassed an extensive database on various cannabinoids and their
properties. Boston-based Ginkgo Bioworks is a synthetic biology company that has
developed a cutting edge, automated platform for biological engineering and
fermentation. Using synthetic DNA to modify yeast and other organisms, the company
endeavors to produce large amounts of various rare strains through this more efficient,
lower-cost, novel process. Indeed, as we asserted in the MO/CRON note (link), we
believe that this strategic partnership was integral in informing the entry of the largest
tobacco player in the U.S., into the legal global cannabis market.

By way of background, in September 2018, Cronos and Ginkgo announced an
agreement to produce cultured cannabinoids. Ginkgo is tasked with developing strains
of yeast that can produce eight target cannabinoids. Cronos would then handle large
scale production and distribution of those cultured cannabinoids. The total agreement is
valued at $122MM; this includes $22MM to fund R&D, and up to $100MM of CRON
common shares in tranches in accordance with production milestones. More specifically,
the tranches will be issued once each of the target cannabinoids can be produced for
less than $1,000/kg of pure cannabinoids at a scale of >200 liters as follows: THC (20%),
CBD (15%), THCV (15%), CBC (10%), CBG (10%), CBGV (10%), CBDV (10%), and CBCV
(10%). Cronos and Ginkgo expect to reach the milestone for these eight strains within
three years.
