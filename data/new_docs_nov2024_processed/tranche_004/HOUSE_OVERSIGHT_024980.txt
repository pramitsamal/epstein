press about his relationship with a teenage Moroccan belly dancer
suspected of prostitution. Either way, he unloaded on Hillary during
an awkward one-on-one in Astana, Kazakhstan.

hallway near the conference room, Berlusconi told Hillary, “The

Mostly she let him vent. Her background as a politician and long

Even as she navigates these choppy waters, Hillary’s own vessel is
