Rhinebeck, New York, including the tiny village of women around
Hillary who helped raise her: Maggie Williams, Melanne Verveer,
Cheryl Mills, Capricia Marshall (now head of protocol for the

Mezvinsky’s (divorced) parents. “They were three and now they’re
four,” one friend says. (Contrary to rumors, Hillary’s aides say that
Chelsea’s marriage is going well.)
