This military and diplomatic news may
appear positive. But Syrian sources caution
that the battlefield advances may accelerate
movement toward a breakup of the country,
as Alawite supporters of the regime retreat
to their ancestral homeland in the
northwestern region around Latakia. And
there’s no sign that either Assad or his
Russian patrons are paying any more than
lip service to a political settlement.

One potential game-changer is a request for
U.S. help in training elite rebel units, which
has been drafted by Brig. Gen. Salim Idriss,
the new commander of the opposition Free
Syrian Army. In a letter dated Feb. 4, he
seeks U.S. assistance in “training for: (1)
special operations; (2) international
humanitarian law; and (3)... in chemical
weapons security.”

Idriss requested various supplies for these
elite units, including: “(1) combat armor;
(2) night vision goggles; (3) hand held
monocular and longer range spotting
equipment; (4) strategic communications;
(5) winterization packs; and (6) tactical
communications.”

This request for assistance was made just

head of a new opposition coalition, to
negotiate with government representatives.
