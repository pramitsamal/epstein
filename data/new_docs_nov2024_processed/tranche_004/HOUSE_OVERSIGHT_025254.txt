CIO View (Probability: 75%*) Sluggish expansion
¢ Global economic activity has shown signs of improvement over the last month — albeit from a low base. Importantly,
the JPM global composite PMI (a survey measuring economic activity) rose significantly to 52.5 in September from 50.9
in August. The increase was driven by improvements in both manufacturing and service sector activity. Thus, the
global manufacturing PMI rose marginally to 48.9 from 48.1, while the services PMI jumped two index points to 54.

* Geographically, improvements were concentrated in the emerging markets and the US. Indeed, we think that
downside risks in the US have diminished lately and we expect the moderate recovery to continue ahead. Chinese data
are still mixed, but we think that an improvement in the economic momentum is in the cards in 4Q. In the EMU and
UK, recent PMI surveys deteriorated but we still expect the EMU to improve gradually in coming quarters. Overall, we
expect the moderate improvement in global economic activity to continue ahead. A key driver here is the latest wave
of ultra-expansionary monetary policy. Downside risks have diminished somewhat in recent months. We expect Greece
to stay in the euro this year and sign a new memorandum in November. In the US modest fiscal tightening is expected
with the Fed mitigating downside growth risks. The risk of an idiosyncratic slowdown in Asia has declined as the latest
Chinese data confirms that the economy has bottomed.

¢ Global consumer price inflation peaked in summer 2011 and has since fallen gradually. Base effects and rising
commodity prices since June may push up the global headline rate of inflation in coming months.

A Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*) Return to long-term trend
¢ The Eurozone crisis abates. Financial market conditions recover, mitigating the drag from fiscal austerity.

¢ Growth in Western Europe turns decisively positive by early 2013 and the US economy grows above trend.

& Negative scenario (Probability: 15%*) Recession
¢ There are three key downside risks to the global economy: 1) a significant escalation of the Eurozone debt crisis; 2) a
sharp fiscal contraction in the US, and 3) a sharp deceleration of the Chinese economy. Each of these risks could
precipitate a significant downturn of the global economy.
