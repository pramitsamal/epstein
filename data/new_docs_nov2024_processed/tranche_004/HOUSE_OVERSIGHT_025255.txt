Key financial market driver 1 — Kurozone crisis

Key questions

e What do we expect from the economy and ECB policy?

° Can Spain and Italy continue to tap the primary market if they ask for a support program?

¢ How much more support will Greece receive and will it be able to stay in the Eurozone next year?

CIO View (Probability: 70%*) Austerity and weak growth
¢ We think the Eurozone economy troughed in 3Q. We expect flattish growth in 4Q 2012 and 1Q 2013 (in line with
consensus). Beyond this, uncertainties regarding the debt crisis and continuing fiscal austerity efforts will likely keep
the pace of recovery subdued. The ECB is still in easing mode but after announcing a conditional bond purchasing
program, it would take a marked worsening of the debt crisis and/or a worsening of economic data to trigger any
further policy action.

¢ There is political pressure on Spain to apply for official financial support (OMT by the ECB and direct support from
the EFSF/ESM). However, the government may hesitate until market pressure rises and/or clear political benefits are on
offer. We think that Italy will have to apply for an aid package similar to Spain’s. We see a high probability of Spain
being downgraded to junk by at least one rating agency.

* OMT bond purchases in the secondary market will focus on maturities of up to three years and countries will be
expected to maintain their funding profiles by also issuing longer-dated bonds. Hence, longer yields should stay
elevated as bondholders remain concerned about countries’ ability and willingness to implement necessary reforms,
and about the de-facto subordination to ECB holdings and official loans. The central banking supervision at the ECB is
unlikely to be ready by January 2013, meaning that direct bank recapitalization through the ESM remains unavailable.
¢ We think Greece will not exit the euro in 2012 but will sign a new memorandum by November, although further
delay is possible. We think that Greece's failure to meet targets may trigger a cut-off from funding by early 2013 and
a possible gradual exit later. Portugal and Ireland should remain on track with their bailout packages, Cyprus will
likely get a new package and Slovenia may ask for help soon.

A Positive scenario (Probability: 15%*) Return to macro stability
¢ Bond yields are contained as peripheral countries’ budgets stay on track and economic activity recovers faster than
expected. Greece complies with the new austerity plans and market confidence is restored.

& Negative scenario (Probability: 15%*) Major shock
¢ Major shocks include Spain and Italy being fully cut off from bond markets, i.e. requiring all new funding through
EFSF/ESM/IMF loans, with European rescue funds only able to cover them until the end of 2013; resistance from core
countries against the ECB program and further support; a Portuguese default; a Greek euro exit before the end of
2012; or a major external shock.
