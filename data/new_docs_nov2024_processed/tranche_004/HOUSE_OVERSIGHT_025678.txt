Bitcoin’s annualized volatility of 95% dwarfs even the most volatile of EM currencies.

Bitcoin’s volatility is 8x the volatility of US equities. In terms of both count and magnitude, Bitcoin, Ether and Ripple have all
experienced more severe drawdowns over their short histories than the S&P 500 has since 1945.

Bitcoin exchanges have thin liquidity, which plays a role in driving enormous price movement—so far to the upside, but which
could cause a flash crash upon a large sell order. A ~$30 million sell order would likely move the market by 5%.

A store of value should predictably preserve wealth. Bitcoin is unable to do so, as it neither generates income nor grows with
earnings.
