Central Bank Cryptocurrencies Could Substantially Reduce Fraud _ pivision

“Say there’s a grant to Nigeria for health stuff—if it’s digital money, they can track that it
was paid to a certain person and when it was paid out. Then you can audit later and say,
‘Did that really happen?’ You don’t want to tell donors that three percent went astray. Now
that there’s digital traceability in a place like Nigeria, where corruption is a huge problem,
we can bring that down. A lot of the optimism we have at the foundation about disease,
education and financial services is because we’re sitting on top of a digital miracle.”
