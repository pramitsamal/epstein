Felony rioting is defined in D.C. law by at least five people who use “tumultuous and violent conduct of the
threat thereof” to cause “serious bodily harm” and instigate more than $5,000 in property damage.

Six local officers were injured by protesters during Trump’s big day. The glass windows of several businesses
were shattered in downtown D.C. including Bank of America, McDonald’s and Starbucks.

All of the people who have already been charged were released on their own recognizance and given their next
court appearance dates.

At least one of those arrested was a Vocativ journalist covering the protests, and he was defended by heavy-
hitter and former White House attorney Kathryn Ruemmler, Buzzfeed reported.
