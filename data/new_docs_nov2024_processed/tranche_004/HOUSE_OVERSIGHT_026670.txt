interest rate hikes by the Fed, and global geopolitical catalysts (e.g. elections, referendums) in 2017 to
contribute to a rise in market volatility. These factors should help us to approach our target daily VaR of
0.80%, and also provide an attractive environment for many of our strategies to generate alpha. While
having more risk on the balance sheet does imply that our return volatility and drawdowns will be larger, it
is reasonable to expect that any positive returns would increase as well.

e For the fourth quarter of 2016, 42% of “Fundamental L/S,” 45% of “Quantitative,” and 67% of
“Other” managers were profitable.

e The top five performing managers contributed 38% of the quarterly total positive return, with the
largest single manager positively contributing 9%. The bottom five performing managers made up
56% of negative returns, with the largest single manager negatively contributing 17%.

° While 2015 was a stronger year for our strategy overall compared to 2016, we were pleased to see
a continual diversification of return attribution across our managers in 2016. The below statistics
compare 2016 with 2015 and present a similar picture of limited return concentration.
