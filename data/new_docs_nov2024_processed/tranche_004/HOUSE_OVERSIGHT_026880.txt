RLK: The GDP per capita has gone
up more than 50 times in these 40
years. And so that's number one.
But number two is national
rejuvenation, national pride. This is
what the government and the Party
has brought to China in terms of its
position in the world. So it cannot
back down and look weak in terms
of these tariff attacks. But given
that, given that environment, the
Chinese response is very carefully
calibrated.

RLK: China levying tariffs on $60
billion is not dollar for dollar, the
way the first $50 billion was. But
what it is, in fact, is in proportion —
because $60 billion is roughly 40
percent of the roughly $150 billion
of the total US exports to China,
just as $200 billion is roughly 40
percent of the little over $500
billion of the total China exports to
the US.
