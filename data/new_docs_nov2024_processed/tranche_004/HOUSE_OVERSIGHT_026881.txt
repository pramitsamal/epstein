RLK: So it’s a
proportional
response.
The rhetoric
in the press
is also
milder. US
has not been
called so
much of
bullying
anymore.
Also some of
China’s
tariffs are 5
percent as
well as 10
percent,
whereas the
US tariffs are
all 10
percent
[going up to
25 percent].
So China is
sending a
signal that it
wants to
ratchet this
down.
