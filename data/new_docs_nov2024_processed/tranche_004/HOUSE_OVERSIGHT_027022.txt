A country in which our children will want to
live, and your children will be proud of.

Ladies and gentlemen,
We are at a decisive juncture in our history...

As President Kennedy noted during the Cuban
Missile Crisis:

o The path we have chosen for the present
is full of hazards, as all paths are. But it is
the one most consistent with our character
and courage as a nation...

| believe we possess the character and courage
as a nation to make those tough decisions for
the future, peace and security of the State of
Israel.

Please allow me to end with the millennia old
blessing:

o OWA Ny NRA! OWA, |N ny? Ty OWA

May the Lord bestow his people with courage;
may the Lord bless his people with peace.
