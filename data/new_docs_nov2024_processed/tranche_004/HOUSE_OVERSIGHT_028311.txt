The House of the Nobleman
Yes But Is It Art?

An Elegant Madness: High Society in Regency England

Saturday morning. What to do what to do? Fortunately a rather nice invite has arrived to the mysteriously named
House of the Nobleman. It's Before Midday and North of The River but said nobleman is allegedly a Russian
billionaire so it's hard to say no. Plus champers and canapés are champers and canapés. And it’s a gallery ina
house so really we have to check out the competition.

“Highlight of Freeze!” shouts the press release. We'll see. First impressions are good. The house is on the Outer
Circle of The Regent’s Park and just like the theatre that’s the place to be hot. Important looking girl asks us have
we been invited. “Qu’est-ce que c’est?”

Indoors, the ceilings are surprisingly low for us six footers. The interior designer clearly has a penchant for egg-&-
dart cornicing. It’s everywhere, except where it’s broken by over-scaled doors. Marble bathrooms, lit stair treads,
shiny black kitchen. It’s all a bit bling for Lavender’s Blue taste and we don’t really do Post 1900 anyway.

But my gosh the art on display reads like a Who’s Who list. Here’s a tour:

Is it Art or is it a Chair? asks Zelda in a loud stage whisper

But where's the Bubbly?
