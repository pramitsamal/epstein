10 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.

Opinion of the Court

agency documents that “would not be available by law to a
party ... in litigation with the agency” incorporates the
general law governing attorney work-product privilege as
it exists when the statute is applied. PTC v. Grolier Inc.,
462 U.S. 19, 20, 26-27 (19838) (emphasis added); id., at 34,
n.6 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). Likewise, a general reference to federal dis-
covery rules incorporates those rules “as they are found on
any given day, today included,” El Encanto, Inc. v. Hatch
Chile Co., 825 F. 3d 1161, 1164 (CA10 2016), and a gen-
eral reference to “the crime of piracy as defined by the law
of nations” incorporates a definition of piracy “that changes
with advancements in the law of nations,” United States
v. Dire, 680 F. 3d 446, 451, 467-469 (CA4 2012).

The same logic applies here. The IOIA’s reference to the
immunity enjoyed by foreign governments is a general
rather than specific reference. The reference is to an
external body of potentially evolving law—the law of
foreign sovereign immunity—not to a specific provision of
another statute. The IOIA should therefore be understood
to link the law of international organization immunity to
the law of foreign sovereign immunity, so that the one
develops in tandem with the other.

The IFC contends that the IOIA’s reference to the im-
munity enjoyed by foreign governments is not a general
reference to an external body of law, but is instead a spe-
cific reference to a common law concept that had a fixed
meaning when the IOJA was enacted in 1945. And be-
cause we ordinarily presume that “Congress intends to
incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law
terms it uses,” Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 23
(1999), the IFC argues that we should read the IOIA to
incorporate what the IFC maintains was the then-settled
meaning of the “immunity enjoyed by foreign govern-
ments”: virtually absolute immunity.

But in 1945, the “immunity enjoyed by foreign govern-
