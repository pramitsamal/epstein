TB: You could say we were supporting the democracy element in Cairo’s
Tahrir Square. Were we not?

DP: Yes and rightly so. The initial demonstrations of early 2011 were
spearheaded by the liberals and seculars who deserve U.S. support. But
they got quickly pushed aside and Washington barely paid them further
attention.

TB: We gave foreign aid to Mubarak. Was that a bad idea?

DP: That aid dates back to the utterly different circumstances of the
Egypt-Israel peace treaty of 1979 and became progressively more wrong-
headed. It should long ago have been discontinued. More broadly, I
believe in aid for emergencies (soup and blankets) and as a bribe, but not
for economic development. That the Obama administration is
contemplating aid, including military hardware, to the Morsi government
outrages me.
