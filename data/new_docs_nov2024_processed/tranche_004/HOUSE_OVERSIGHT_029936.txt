if the flotilla sets sail does not seem far-fetched, despite the
organizers’ vows to the contrary.

So the flotilla has virtually no support in Israel. Still, some are
uncomfortable with the way the project has been criticized as an
attack on Israel itself.

Shlomo Avineri, a historian and onetime director general of Israel’s
foreign ministry, wrote in the Haaretz newspaper last week that when
the flotilla is described as aimed at delegitimizing Israel, he recalls
the Soviet Union’s reaction to any criticism as an assault on its right
to exist. Opposition to Israeli policy is not the same as an attack on its
existence, he said, and the government’s approach damages Israel.
His argument about the flotilla points to the larger dynamic: the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute is increasingly disintegrating from a debate
over borders and security into a battle between those claiming that
Israel is a genocidal machine and those who dismiss every attack on
its policy as an assault on its essence.
