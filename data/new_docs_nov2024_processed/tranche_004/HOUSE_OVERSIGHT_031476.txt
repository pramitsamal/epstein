Lawyers for U.S.-based
Turkish cleric fear
attacks on his life

WASHINGTON | BY JULIA HARTE

Lawyers for U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen said on
Friday they feared attacks on his life following Turkey's
demands that he be extradited to face allegations that he
ordered a failed coup against the government last month.

The lawyers said they expected Gulen, who has denied any
involvement in the July 15 coup attempt, will remain in his
remote mountain compound in Pennsylvania.

We have read concerns from Turkey that Mr. Gulen, this
elderly, frail religious leader, is going to flee to another country,
said Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorney Reid Weingarten on
Friday, calling such allegations absurd.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has blamed Gulen for the
violence, in which Erdogan said 237 people were killed
excluding the plotters and more than 2,100 wounded, and said
the United States should extradite him to Turkey. The U.S.
government has not done so, and the dispute has raised
questions about relations between the two allies.
