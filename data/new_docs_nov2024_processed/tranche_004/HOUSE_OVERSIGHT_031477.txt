Turkey, a member of the NATO alliance, hosts American troops
and warplanes at Incirlik Air Base, an important staging area for
the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

At a news conference in Washington, Weingarten and Michael
Miller, another Steptoe attorney, said evidence from a 2015
case financed by the Turkish government against Gulen in U.S.
federal court in Pennsylvania showed that the Turkish
government relies on dubious proof to make its case against
him.

That case alleged Gulen issued coded orders to followers in the
Turkish judiciary in a 2009 sermon to persecute members of
another religious sect. It also alleged that the script of a popular
Turkish television show was laced with follow-up messages.
The case was dismissed by a judge in June.

Turkish government officials, however, say such evidence is
valid because Gulen operates covertly and sends encoded
messages to his followers.

Turkey has sent the United States new documents in recent
days containing evidence that Turkish authorities say proves the
cleric was behind the attempted coup. U.S. officials say they are
looking through them.
