The Gates speech effectively marks the end of the American ambition
to turn Nato into the global, military arm of a unified western world.
The Americans have flirted with this idea, ever since the onset of the
“war on terror’. But, as the Afghan war has worn on, so the military
effort has become more and more heavily dependent on the US.

The fact that Europeans called for a campaign in Libya that they are
incapable of conducting alone has merely re-enforced the American
view that the European arm of Nato is, to varying degrees, feckless
and unreliable. Disarray and recriminations within Nato hobble the
single most effective potential tool for western military intervention
overseas.

Even more significant in the long run is the American anxiety that
budgetary constraints, which are leading to defence cuts in Europe,
are beginning to be replicated in the US itself. Admiral Michael
Mullen, America’s top military officer, has called the budget deficit
the single biggest threat to US national security. It is also the single
biggest constraint on future bouts of “liberal interventionism”’.
Money is not the only problem, however. Over the past 20 years it
has become apparent that swiftly agreed-upon military actions can
lead to entanglements that last for many years. There is still a Nato
mission in Kosovo and an EU military mission in Bosnia, more than
a decade after the fighting ended in both places.

As for Afghanistan — that conflict has now lasted almost twice as long
as the second world war. Western governments are also only
beginning to come to terms with what may soon be required in Libya.
Against this background, there are very few takers for yet another
military venture — this time in Syria.
