idealists think about revolution today, they have Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary in mind.

Few assumptions can lead you into as much trouble this quickly.
Even in 1989-90, those countries were the exception and not the

Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and of course Russia itself. More people
live in countries where the 1989-90 revolutionary wave failed to

investment if they continued along the path of democratic reform.
They lay on the ‘western’ side of the ancient division of Europe
between the Orthodox east and the Catholic/Protestant homeland of
the modern liberal tradition.

No Arab country looks anything like this. Indeed, most seem closer
to Yugoslavia and Belarus or, at best, Ukraine. We, and they, may
get lucky, and the revolutions in the Arab world may lead to

If realists ignore the inevitability of revolution, idealists close their
eyes to the problems of revolutionary upheavals in societies that have
difficult histories, deep social divisions, and poor short term
economic prospects. Unfortunately the countries most likely to
