Assad's Chemical Romance
Leonard Spector

AUGUST 23, 2011 -- The continued unrest in Syria, coupled with
President Barack Obama's call for President Bashar al-Assad to leave
power, has thrown the future of the country into flux. Among the
most troubling uncertainties is the fate of Syria's chemical weapons
arsenal, which, if not protected properly, could fall into the wrong
hands, with catastrophic results. Syria is one of a handful of states
that the U.S. government believes possess large stocks of chemical
agents in militarized form -- that is, ready for use in artillery shells
and bombs. The arsenal is thought to be massive, involving
thousands of munitions and many tons of chemical agent, which
range, according to CIA annual reports to Congress, from the blister
gases of World War I -- such as mustard gas -- to advanced nerve
agents such as sarin and possibly persistent nerve agents, such as VX
gas.

In the hands of Assad -- and his father Hafez before him -- these
weapons have been an ace-in-the-hole deterrent against Israel's
nuclear capability. The Assad regime, however, has never openly
brandished this capability: It did not employ chemical weapons in the
1982 Lebanon War against Israel, even after Israeli warplanes
decimated the Syrian Air Force. Nor have they been deployed, or
their use threatened, in attempting to bring Assad's current domestic
antagonists to heel. And although Syria is accused of providing
powerful missiles to Hezbollah, including some of a type that carried
chemical warfare agents in the Soviet arsenal, Assad has not
reportedly transferred lethal chemical capabilities to the Lebanon-
based Shiite organization.
