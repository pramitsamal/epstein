With 285 rooms, Crete's Candia Maris beachfront resort is large by Starting Friday
Greek hotel standards. It shares the space between the large and airy 20/7 at 8pm BST

guestrooms, a choice of restaurants and a host of activities, whatever

your interest. Waterbabies will love the seven pools and sybarites can

camp out in the resort's Thalassotherapy spa. Overlooking Amoudara
beach just outside Heraklion, the resort underwent a top-to-bottom
renovation five years ago, adding modern style and amenities to this
uber-resort.
