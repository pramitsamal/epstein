Conclusions: 100-Year Review of USA Inc. Income Statement
• America’s government has grown dramatically - USA Inc.’s revenue as percent of
GDP has risen from 2% to 15%. Individual / social insurance (Social Security +
Medicare) taxes have risen dramatically while customs / excise / estate taxes
have declined in relative importance. In addition, USA Inc.’s spending as percent
of GDP has risen to 24% in 2010, up from 3% average between 1790 and 1930.
• USA Inc.’s average operating income was at or near breakeven for most of the
periods from 1910 to 1970.
• In the 1970s, as healthcare expenses (related to Medicare and Medicaid) began
to surge, USA Inc. reported more frequent – and bigger – losses. Since 1970,
USA Inc. showed a profit just 4 times (F1998-F2001, when economic growth was
especially robust and defense spending was relatively low).
• General expense trends since 1970: non-defense discretionary spending has
been flattish (except in recessions with material one-time charges), healthcare
spending (largely Medicare + Medicaid) has risen materially, Social Security
spending has been flattish, defense spending has been down to flattish, and
interest payments varied with interest rates.

Operations of USA Inc. Are Solid,
Excluding Medicare / Medicaid and One-Time Charges
� Revenues of USA Inc. (largely from individual and corporate income and
payroll taxes) can fund most expenses (largely spending on defense,
Social Security, unemployment insurance, education, law enforcement,
transportation, energy, infrastructure, federal employee & veteran
benefits, and interest payments).
In fact, for USA Inc.'s operations besides Medicare / Medicaid and
one-time expenses, there’s ample scope to increase spending for
defense, education, law enforcement, transportation, infrastructure
and energy by ~4%* in aggregate and still remain break-even.
www.kpcb.com
Note: *Excluding Medicare / Medicaid revenue & expenses, USA Inc.’s expenses are, on average, 4% below revenue levels
from F1996 to F2010 based on our calculation of White House OMB data.

Defense Spending Is The Second-Largest Expense Item After
Entitlements, But Below Long-Term Trend as Share of GDP
• With budget deficits rising, some advocate cutting back on defense spending, the
second-largest expense item after entitlements.
• Defense spending has risen substantially in recent years, due to the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, and other costs related to the Global War on Terror. As a
percentage of GDP, however, defense spending in the U.S. remains below its 60-
year trend.
• On an inflation-adjusted basis, U.S. defense spending is at its highest level since
World War II. With overhead ~40% of all spending, the Defense Business Board
found DoD consistently pays “more for less” and fails to attack overhead as the
private sector would. 1
• The Esquire Commission to Balance the Federal Budget, a group of four former
Republican and Democratic senators, found over $300 billion 2 in defense
restructuring opportunities, and other analysts proposed gradual cuts to reduce
the defense budget by 14% by 2018. 3

Entitlement Spending: Lacks Sufficient Dedicated Funding
� Entitlement programs were created with the best of intentions by
the Government. They serve many of the nation’s poorest, whose
struggles have been made worse by the financial crisis.
�
However, with the exception of Social Security (which was developed
with a pay-as-you-go funding plan and constructed to be legally flexible if
conditions change) and unemployment insurance (which was designed
to be flexible at State level), other entitlement plans (including Medicaid
and Medicare) were developed without sufficient dedicated funding.

Entitlement Spending: Observation About Social Security & Medicare
Part A Trust Fund – More Like Accounting Values Than Real Dollars
�
�
�
�
Social Security Trust Fund balance (accumulated annual surpluses + interest income) = $2.5 trillion as of
2009; Medicare Part A Trust Fund balance = $304 billion as of 2009. These surpluses were invested in a
special (non-marketable) series of U.S. Treasury securities, which were then used to finance budget deficits
in other parts of USA Inc. like Medicaid & Nutrition Assistance.
As a result, many observers have argued that Social Security and Medicare Part A Trust Funds’ balances
are no more than accounting gains on paper owing to: 1) no ‘real’ assets (such as tradable stocks / real
estates…) in these Trust Funds as the special U.S. Treasury securities are non-marketable and 2) the
Treasury Department needs to raise taxes / cut other programs’ spending / borrow more money in the future
to meet any withdrawal requests.
We think that for Social Security and Medicare Part A programs, their Trust Funds’ balances have legal
value as USA Inc. is legally obliged to repay the principal and interest on the Treasury securities held in
respective Trust Funds.
However, we think that these Trust Fund balances have NO economic value as these cumulative surpluses
have been spent by USA Inc. to reduce the borrowing need in the past. When Social Security & Medicare
begin net withdrawal from their Trust Funds (likely in 2017E), USA Inc.’s debt levels + interest payments
growth could accelerate, owing to the double whammy of: 1) loss of revenue source (previous surpluses)
and 2) additional Treasury redemption costs related to Trust Funds’ withdrawal requests.
�
Consequently, we exclude Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds’ balances and interest income
from our financial models and calculate their liabilities on a net basis.

Entitlement Spending: Non-Partisan CBO Advises Excluding Social Security /
Medicare Trust Funds’ Balances + Interest Income in Fiscal Analysis
� Trust funds can be useful mechanisms for monitoring the balance between
earmarked receipts and a program's spending, but they are basically an
accounting device, and their balances, even if invested in Treasury securities,
provide no resources to the government for meeting future funding commitments.
When those payments come due, the government must finance them in the
same way that it finances other commitments -- through taxes or borrowing from
the public. Thus, assessing the state of the federal government's future finances
requires measuring such commitments independently of their trust fund status or
the balance recorded in the funds.

Entitlement Spending: Funding Patterns of Some
Entitlement Programs Work Better than Others
Have Worked Relatively Well Financially:
• Social Security – Has operated at close to break-even - so far - thanks to sufficient payroll
tax income from a relatively large working-age population. In fact, Social Security has
worked so well, that its surplus net income has been used to finance other government
activities such as Medicaid.
• Unemployment Insurance – Has operated at close to break-even thanks to accumulated
net incomes during ‘good years’ (though expenses spiked to $123 billion / $160 billion in
2009 / 2010 from $45 billion in 2008 owing to recession).
Have Worked Relatively Poorly Financially:
• Medicaid – Has operated at an average annual loss of $160 billion with, in effect, an
average net margin of -100% over past 15 years; the annual dollar loss has risen from $108
billion to $273 billion because of rising healthcare costs and expanded enrollment.
• Medicare – Has operated at an average annual loss of $123 billion with, in effect, an
average net margin of -83% over past 15 years; the margin has fallen from -66% to -154%
(or -$64 billion in annual loss to -$272 billion) because of rising healthcare costs +
expanding coverage (added Part D prescription drug benefits through legislation in 2003,
rolled out in 2006).

Entitlement Spending: Clarification On
‘Unfunded’ / ‘Net Responsibilities’…
� There is debate about the semantics of using words like unfunded / net
responsibilities to describe the financial status of entitlement programs like Social
Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
� ‘Unfunded’ – We define ‘unfunded’ liabilities for Social Security and Medicare as
the present value of future expenditures in excess of dedicated future revenue.
We call Social Security and Medicare ‘partially unfunded’ entitlement programs
as their future expenditures are projected to exceed dedicated future revenue.
� ‘Net Responsibilities’ – USA Inc. does not record these ‘unfunded’ financial
commitments as explicit liabilities on balance sheet, owing to Federal accounting
standards. 1
� USA Inc.’s Dept. of Treasury calls these commitments ‘net responsibilities’
or ‘net expenditures’ in its annual Financial Report of the U.S. Government.
� Medicaid – We view Medicaid as an ‘unfunded’ liability as there is no dedicated
revenue source to match expected expenses in our financial analysis. Medicaid
is jointly funded on a pay-as-you go basis by Federal and State general tax
revenue.

…Entitlement Spending: Clarification On
‘Unfunded’ / ‘Net Responsibilities’
� Unless they are reduced, USA Inc.’s financial liabilities -- whether they are actual
debt or the present value of future promises, whether called ‘unfunded’ liabilities or
‘net responsibilities’ and whether funded by dedicated taxes or general revenue –
represent significant claims on USA Inc.’s future economic resources.
� To be sure, the projected unfunded liabilities are not the same as debt, because
Congress can change the laws that are behind those future promises. With a few
exceptions, however, over the past 60 years, lawmakers have acted to boost rather
than reduce them.

Entitlement Spending: Observation from Previous Slide
� Clearly, lower interest rates have allowed Americans to
borrow more and save less. But given the high correlation
between rising entitlement income for beneficiaries and
declining savings rates, one might also wonder if Americans
feel less compelled to save money as they feel that they can
depend on the government to give them money.

Medicaid: Facing Accelerating Cash Flow Deficits
� Social Welfare Program – Created in 1965 to provide health insurance to low-income
population (2% of Americans under coverage then and 16% now*).
� No Dedicated Funding – Federal funding comes from general revenue (all forms of tax
receipts).
� Ever-Growing Expenses – $273 billion in F2010, up 2x from 10 years ago.
� Rising Healthcare Costs – Owing to aging population + unhealthy life styles +
technology advances.
�
�
Growing Beneficiary + Benefits – Covered beneficiaries expanded beyond lowincome
group in 1980s to include additional groups (like individuals who have high
medical expenses and have spent down their assets, and some of those who lost
their employer-sponsored healthcare insurance coverage in recession), while
covered benefits expanded to include prescription drugs / dental services. Total
expenditures on these new groups and benefits represented ~60% of Medicaid
program’s spending in 2001, per Kaiser Family Foundation estimates. See
slide 319-322 for more details.
Moral Hazard – As a “free good,” Medicaid reduced demand for private long-term
insurance 1 while regulation loopholes + need-based benefit policies created
incentives to abuse the Medicaid reimbursement system.
Note: 1) for more information, please see Jeffrey Brown and Amy Finkelstein, “The Interaction of Public and Private Insurance: Medicaid and the Long-Term

Medicaid: Observations
� 49 million (26MM low-income children / 12MM low-income adults / 7MM
disabled / 4MM elderly) Americans (16% of population) received an
average of $4,684 in tax-payer funded payments from the federal
government for healthcare in 2009. For context, $6,872 in healthcare
benefits is 13% of average annual per-capita income for Americans.
� When Medicaid was created in 1965 to provide health insurance to lowincome
Americans, 1 in 50 Americans received Medicaid, now 1 in 6
Americans receives Medicaid.
� That said, Medicaid is an important benefit for recipients as it provides
access to healthcare for low-income adults and their children. In recent
years, Medicaid beneficiaries and benefit payments have risen faster than
population and per-capita income growth owing to expanded coverage,
economic difficulties and associated sluggish wage growth for low- and
lower-middle-income families, and continued healthcare cost inflation.

Medicaid: While We Focus on Federal Government Dynamics, It’s Notable
that State Government Medicaid Funding Also Faces Significant Challenges
�
�
Medicaid = Major and Growing Expense Line Item for State Governments
�
�
�
Medicaid funding responsibility is shared between federal & state governments. States with higher
per-capita income (like New York) pay ~50% of total Medicaid cost while states with lower per-capita
income (like Mississippi) pay ~22%.
On average, Medicaid accounted for 21% of total state spending in F2009 (ranging from Missouri at
35% to Alaska at 8%). Enrollment growth has been accelerating, in part, owing to more people losing
employer-sponsored health insurance in the recession, and thus overall Medicaid costs jumped ~11%
Y/Y from October, 2009 to June, 2010.
State governments (which unlike the federal government must balance their annual budgets) cannot
pay for such elevated levels of Medicaid and maintain normal spending levels for other services (like
education and public safety).
Enter the Federal Government
�
ARRA (2009 economic stimulus) provided ~$100 billion in support for the states to pay for elevated
levels of Medicaid costs and to avoid large budget cuts in education and public safety. This went a
long way toward holding down the states’ contribution, but it is a one-time unsustainable fix.
� Federal Support May Be Expiring by June, 2011
�
If no action is taken, the Medicaid-related cost burden on the states will rise dramatically in coming
years. As a result, many states are on the verge of implementing Medicaid cost containment plans
that include cuts in doctor payments, benefit limitations, higher patient co-payments, etc. Moreover,
many states are fearful that the recently enacted healthcare reform will lead to additional Medicaidrelated
costs when it goes into full effect in 2014.

Medicare: Complex Social Insurance Program
With Insufficient Funding
� Social Insurance Program – Created in 1965 to provide health insurance to the elderly (65+).
� Four Parts – A) Hospital Insurance (to cover inpatient expenses, introduced in 1965); B)
Medical Insurance (optional outpatient expenses, 1965); C) Medicare Advantage Plans
(private alternative to A&B, 1997) and D) Prescription Drug Coverage (enacted 2003).
� Funding Mechanism Varies
� Part A has dedicated funding via payroll taxes (2.9% of total payroll), though has been
running at an annual deficit since 2008 as related payments exceed taxes; Trust Fund is
expected to be depleted by 2017E, per Social Security Administration.
� Part B & D has no dedicated funding (75% of funding came from government allocation /
25% came from enrollees’ premium payments).
� Part C funding came Part A & Part B.
� Ever-Growing Expenses – $452 billion expenses in F2010, up 2x from 10 years ago
� Rising Healthcare Costs – Owing to aging population + unhealthy life styles + technology
advances.
� Moral Hazard – As a “free good,” Medicare reduced demand for private long-term
insurance 1 while loopholes in the regulations + need-based benefit policies created
incentives to abuse the system.

Medicare: Observations
� 46 million elderly Americans (15% of population) received an average
of $8,325 in tax-payer funded payments for healthcare in 2009 ($5,079
for hospital care; $3,246 for medical insurance & prescription drugs).
� On the surface, $8,325 in free healthcare benefits every year certainly
seems like a high number – 23% of annual per-capita income –
(although working Medicare recipients do pay Medicare taxes).
� As with employer-sponsored health insurance plans, if people, in effect, get
a free benefit (with little personal financial commitment), they may not be
especially diligent and frugal about how they ‘spend’ it. The same concept
extends beyond healthcare recipients to the healthcare providers.*
� When Medicare was created in 1965 to provide health insurance to elderly
Americans, 1 in 10 Americans received Medicare, now 1 in 7 Americans receives
Medicare…above the initial ‘plan.’

Think About That…
� Total government spending on healthcare (including Medicare, Medicaid and
other programs) has risen 7x from 1.2% of GDP in 1960 to 8.2% in 2009 while
total government spending on education has risen only 0.6x from 4% of GDP in
1960 to 6% in 2009.
� Medicare and Medicaid, which did not exist in 1960, rose to 35% of total healthcare
spending in 2009, while out-of-pocket spending declined to 12% of total healthcare
spending in 2009 (or $894 per person per year*), down from 47% in 1960 (or $478
per person*).
� Lifetime healthcare costs for the average American are $631,000, of which the
government pays for an estimated 48% while private insurers (like UnitedHealth and
Blue Cross Blue Shield) pay 32% and consumers pay just 12%.
� When citizens don’t need to pay directly for something (like healthcare) and are given
an expensive good / service for free (or well below cost), they tend to consume more
of it – it’s basic supply and demand economics.
� This approach faces increasing challenges as USA, Inc. has gone deeper and
deeper in debt to pay for it…

Think About That…
� USA per capita healthcare spending is 3x OECD average, yet the
average life expectancy and a variety of health indicators in the US
fall below average.
� But if you spend way more than everyone else, shouldn’t your
results (a.k.a. ‘performance’) be better than everyone else’s, or at
least near the top?
� Should you examine sources of waste/inefficiency given lower
output despite greater input?
� Definition of ‘Performance’ = Amount of useful work accomplished
given certain amount of time and resources.
� Definition of ‘Efficient’ = Obtains maximum benefit from a given
level of input of cost, time, or effort.

PPACA: A Detailed Drilldown into Costs of Recent Healthcare Reform Is Key
as it May Increase Budget Deficit…
� Congressional Budget Office expects Reform to lower the deficit by $143
billion during 2010-19
�
Gross cost of $938 billion for expanded coverage, per CBO.
� Less: $511 billion in spending cuts from lower Medicare reimbursement rate + $420
billion in tax revenues (excl. excise tax) from higher payroll tax rates on high-income
families and indoor tanning services + $149 billion in penalty payments by
employers/individuals and excise tax on “Cadillac” insurance plans with annual cost
exceeding $10,000 for individual / $28,000 for families.

� Issues With Official Cost Estimates to Consider
�
�
�
�
Deficit neutral status somewhat reliant on future lawmakers’ willingness to implement Medicare
savings/reimbursement reductions:
� Reductions in payment rates for many types of Healthcare providers relative to the rates that
would have been paid under prior law (always a politically difficult decision).
� However the good news is that recommendations from the Independent Payment Advisory
Board focused on reducing growth in per capita Medicare spending if it exceeds target
automatically become the law without congressional intervention if Congress allows IPAB to
operate as planned.
CBO estimates the effects of proposals as written: CBO acknowledges that it is unclear whether
reform can actually reduce the annual growth rate in Medicare spending from 4% (historical
average) to 2% for the next two decades, as PPACA estimates assume.
Relies on excise taxes on sectors of the healthcare industry that could be passed through to
consumers via price increases.
Starting in 2018, assumes taxation of high premium employment-based health insurance plans.
� Opportunities For Cost Savings to Consider
�
�
Increased access to preventative care could potentially slow down overall healthcare cost growth.
Such potential effect is not captured in CBO scoring.
Investments in information technology and new provider & consumer incentives can drive better
and more efficient care.

PPACA –
There Is Potential for ‘Unintended’ Consequences
� The new law changes some system incentives, which may lead to new behavior
patterns, many of which are complex and hard to predict.
� The market may adapt to new MLR (Medical Loss Ratio) rules that incentivize
and reward a very specific (but ultimately arbitrary) cost structure.
� The cost/benefit analysis for employers and consumers may change, and
some may opt to re-evaluate their current employer-sponsored coverage
offerings.
� Health plans that are no longer economically viable may exit markets, potentially
adding to the uninsured problem prior to 2014.
� Likely acceleration in consolidation of payers as well as providers.

Historical Anecdote – “An Accurate Economic Forecast Might Have
Sunk Medicare & Medicaid [in 1965]”
• In 1965, the official estimate of Medicare’s costs was $500 million per year,
roughly $3 billion in 2005 dollars.*
• The actual cost of Medicare has turned out to be 10x that estimate.
• Medicare’s actual net loss (tax receipts + trust fund interest – expenditures)
has exceeded $3 billion (adjusted for inflation) every year since 1976 and
was $146 billion in 2008 alone. In other words, had the original estimate been
accurate, the cumulative 43-year cost since Medicare was created would
have been $129 billion, adjusted for inflation.
• In fact, the actual cumulative spending has been $1.4 trillion** (adjusted for
inflation)...in effect, 10x over budget.
• While calculations have been flawed from the beginning for some of USA Inc.’s
entitlement programs, little has been done to correct the problems.
� An accurate economic forecast might have sunk Medicare.

However, More Recent Healthcare Entitlement Such as Medicare
part D Has Cost Less Than Expected
� Medicare Part D (the 2006 outpatient drug benefit for seniors) was projected to
cost $111 billion annually.
� In 2009, Medicare Part D’s actual cost = $61 billion, 45% below projection.
� The government originally projected 43 million beneficiaries in 2009, but only 33
million seniors (23% below projection) elected to participate in 2009.
� Medicare Part D was outsourced to the private sector, and seniors elected to
enroll in plans operated primarily by managed care organizations, which utilize a
variety of techniques to reduce costs and improve the quality of care.
� The Washington Times stated on August 16 th 2010 – The lower cost - a result of
slowing demand for prescription drugs, higher use of generic drugs and fewer
people signing up - has surprised even some of the law's most pessimistic
critics.
� The Part D experience has given some observers hope that PPACA will not cost
more than anticipated.

Unemployment Benefits: Long-Term Break-Even,
Though Prone to Cyclicality
� Social Insurance Program – Created in 1935 as part of the Social Security Act
to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible workers who are
unemployed through no fault of their own (via layoffs or natural disasters).
� Funded via Taxing Employers – Employers pay federal government 0.8% of
payroll (in addition to various levels of state unemployment insurance taxes) to
fund the Federal Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.
� Funding = Pro-Cyclical – Rising employment increases revenue and reduces
benefit payments, generally leading to surpluses, while falling employment
reduces revenue and increases benefits payments, leading to periodically large
deficits during recessions.
� Flexible at the State Level by Design – State governments set policies on
unemployment benefit eligibility / duration / tax levels, while federal government
provide financial and legal oversight.
� Generally Break-Even – In 29 of the past 49 years, Federal unemployment
insurance programs have had surpluses. Excluding the 2009 / 2010 loss,
unemployment insurance had a cumulative surplus of $53 billion from 1962 to
2008.

� Structural Problems in USA Labor Force
� Healthcare costs may be a barrier to hiring for employers
� Healthcare benefits = 8% of average total employee compensation; grew at
6.9% CAGR from 1998 to 2008 compared with 4.5% CAGR in salaries.
� Healthcare benefits are fixed costs as they are paid on an annual per-worker
basis and do not vary with hours worked.
� As employers try to lower fixed costs to right-size to their reduced revenue
levels, layoffs are the only way to reduce fixed healthcare costs.
� Skills mismatch may be a barrier to hiring for employers
� A large portion of the long-term unemployed may lack requisite skills.
� 14% of firms reported difficulty filling positions due to the lack of suitable talent,
per 5/10 Manpower Research survey.
� Labor immobility resulting from the housing bust may be a barrier to hiring
� One in four homeowners are “trapped” because they owe more than their
houses are worth, so they cannot move to take another job – until they sell or
walk away.

Unemployment Benefits: Bad News
Although economists have shown that extended availability of UI
[unemployment insurance] benefits will increase unemployment duration, the
effect in the latest downturn appears quite small compared with other
determinants of the unemployment rate. Our analyses suggest that extended
UI benefits account for about 0.4 percentage point of the nearly 6 percentage
point increase in the national unemployment rate over the past few years. It is
not surprising that the disincentive effects of UI would loom small in the midst
of the most severe labor market downturn since the Great Depression.
Despite the relatively minor influence of extended UI, it is important to note that
the 0.4 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate represents about
600,000 potential workers who could become virtually unemployable if their
reliance on UI benefits were to continue indefinitely.

Social Security: In Good Shape Now, Yet Challenged in Future
by Aging Population
� Social Insurance Program Created in 1935 – During height of the Great
Depression to help elderly (65+*) and disabled people avoid poverty.
� Pay-as-You-Go Funding – Social Security taxes deducted from current payrolls
to pay out to current eligible recipients of Social Security.
� For Most of its 8 Decades (1935-1970; 1985 - 2009), Annual Social Security
Payments Have Been Funded by Annual Social Security Taxes – However,
based on estimates from Congressional Budget Office (CBO), beginning in 2016
(or earlier), Social Security will begin running an annual deficit as payments
exceed taxes (at unchanged flat tax rate of 12.4% 1 of annual gross wages) – this
is a problem!
� Social Security Has Been Struck by Annual Deficit Crisis Before – From
1975 to 1981, Social Security expenses exceeded revenue every year, which
caused a 45% reduction in the Social Security Trust Fund balance. Legislation
recommended by the Greenspan Commission in 1983 reduced average benefits
by ~5% 2 and raised social insurance tax rates for individuals by ~2.3%. 3 But the
Greenspan Commission fix will run out soon as Social Security turns to operating
loss in 2016.
Note: *Early retirees (62+) could receive partial benefits between 62 and 65. 1) 6.2% taxes paid by employees and matched by employers on gross wages up to
but not exceeding the Social Security wage base of ~$100K; 2) total benefit cuts included $27B savings from benefit taxation for the wealthy and $66B savings
from delay in cost of living adjustments over 1984-1989; 3) average increase in entitlement payroll tax rates between 1982 and 1988, includes Medicare payroll

That’s a Math Problem…
� If an expense rises by 26% and the ability to pay rises by only 3%,
the math doesn’t work. A computer in a science fiction movie might
blurt out, ‘does not compute…does not compute…’
� ‘’Something’s Gotta Give…’ as the 2003 film put it.
� A mathematician or economist would say, ‘the expense must go down or
the ability to pay must rise to match the expense.’
� Simple math implies that the age for collecting full benefits should rise
from 67 to 72, so that expenses more closely match workers’ ability to
pay. Under this scenario, while Americans are living 30% longer, the
‘retirement’ age would rise just 7%, still well below the increase in life
expectancy since Social Security was created.

In Sum…
Heretofore, Social Security and Unemployment Insurance
have been effectively funded, but two significant entitlement
programs (Medicaid and Medicare) were created without
effective funding plans / programs. Only one of these
(Medicaid) is means-tested (indicating that one is eligible for
Medicaid only if he / she does not sufficient financial means).
Left unchanged, Unemployment Insurance funding should
improve as economic growth resumes, but Social Security will no
longer be self-funded within 5-10 years, and the underfunding of
Medicaid and Medicare will simply go from bad to worse.

Debt Level
• 62% of GDP in 2010, up 2x over 30 years
• Projected to rise to ~146% of GDP by 2030E
owing to diminishing surpluses from Social
Security and rising expenses from Medicaid and
other entitlement spending
Effective Interest Rates
• At historic low of 2.2% in 2010, vs. 30-year
average of 6.4%
• Will rise with federal funds target rate & long-term
Treasury yield as economy recovers
Maturity
• Shorter debt maturities imply less leverage to
Maturity reduce future interest payments via inflation
• Long-term debt (10+ year) only 10% of total in
2010, down from 15% in 1985
• Short-term debt (0-1 year) especially large in 2009

Drill Down on Debt Levels & Related Expenses
We begin with a simple study of current and historical debt
levels and key drivers of why debt has risen so much, then
we look at interest rates (which are low by historical
standards) and the impact they have on interest expense,
then we look at the short-term vs. long-term composition of
USA Inc.’s debt.

Debt Level: In the Past, Social Security’s Surpluses Have Masked
USA Inc.’s True Borrowing Needs by $1.4T
� Social Security tax receipts exceeded outlays in every year between 1984 and 2008,
leading to a cumulative surplus of $1.4 trillion.
� These surpluses have been used to fund other parts of federal government operations
(including Medicaid, infrastructure and defense...) under the unified budget accounting
rules.
� Without these past Social Security surpluses, USA Inc. would have to have issued $1.4
trillion more debt (or 16% higher than current level of debt) to fund its operations.

Source: Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Long-Term Budget Outlook (6/10). Note that entitlement spending includes federal government expenditures on Social
Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Data in our chart is based on CBO’s ‘alternative fiscal scenario’ forecast, which assumes a continuation of today’s underlying
fiscal policy. Note that CBO also maintains an ‘extended-baseline’ scenario, which adheres closely to current law. The alternative fiscal scenario deviates from
CBO’s baseline because it incorporates some policy changes that are widely expected to occur (such as extending the 2001-2003 tax cuts rather than letting them
expire as scheduled by current law and adjusting physician payment rates to be in line with the Medicare economic index rather than at lower scheduled rates) and
that policymakers have regularly made in the past.
