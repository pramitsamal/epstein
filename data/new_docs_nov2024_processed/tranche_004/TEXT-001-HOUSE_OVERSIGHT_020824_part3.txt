Drill Down on One-Time Charges
Most of USA Inc.’s recent one-time charges are directly or
indirectly related to America’s real estate bubble and
aggressive borrowing.
First we look at the drivers of the real estate bubble (we call it
‘anatomy of a real estate bubble’), then we drill down on the
past / present / future financial impact of the three types of
one-time charges and the recipients:
1) TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program)
2) GSEs (Government-Sponsored Enterprises)
2) ARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act)

Investors Struggle with Today’s Low ~4% Risk Free Rate
• Pension funds & other investors look for ~8% annual returns
in order to meet promised payouts.
• The challenge is far greater than before given:
• Rising obligations relative to income
• Lower interest rates
• Promises (e.g., pension, healthcare) made during an 8%
interest rate environment are much harder to meet when the
risk free rate has fallen from 8% to 3.6%. 1
• The choice is either to reduce obligations…
or
…Invest in riskier assets.

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP):
Recipient of 38% of Net Government (Taxpayer) Funding*
� In TARP, the financial rescue program (created in October, 2008),
USA Inc. purchased assets and equity from financial institutions to
provide the capital and liquidity needed during the 2008 financial
crisis (which followed the real estate bubble).
In 2009, TARP recipients were broadened to include automakers, an
insurance company (AIG), individual homeowners, small & mediumsized
businesses and other non-bank financial institutions.
To date, USA Inc. loaned these institutions $464 billion and received
$250 billion in repayment and warrant proceeds for a net outstanding
loan balance of $214 billion.

Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs):
Recipients of 28% of Net Government (Taxpayer) Funding
� GSEs Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac extended their guarantees on residential
mortgages from conventional loans into Alt-A, interest-only and subprime
loans.
� While technically not part of the federal government, Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac
have enjoyed an implicit government guarantee on their debt and RMBS
securities as investors believed (correctly, as it turned out) that the federal
government would support these entities if they failed. As a result, GSEs’ longterm
debt securities receive AAA/Aaa ratings from all rating agencies and are
classified by financial markets as “agency securities” with interest rates above
USA Treasuries but below AAA corporate debts.
� Post placing Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac into a government conservatorship,
USA Inc. has so far invested $152B 1 into these two GSEs with an estimated $8-
13B 2 more likely over the next 10 years, given the ongoing weakness in housing
market and the poor underwriting by Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac.

Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac:
A Brief History of Government-Sponsored Enterprises
Fannie Mae established in
1938 to provide liquidity to
the primary and secondary
mortgage markets
Freddie Mac established in
1970 after the Emergency
Home Finance Act to
provide further liquidity to
the mortgage markets
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
placed into conservatorship
at a time when they
guaranteed 57% of the $12
trillion USA mortgage market
1938 1968 1970 1988 2008
Fannie Mae became a publicly traded company in
9/68, in part to reduce rising government debt
levels from the Vietnam War by taking Fannie Mae
debt off USA Inc.’s balance sheet
Freddie Mac became a
publicly traded company in
12/88 with an initial market
cap of $3 billion
Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac – What do they do?
They are insurance and investment companies. Both buy residential and
multifamily mortgages which conform to their underwriting standards from banks
and other originators. They either hold them in their portfolios or package them
into residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). These securities, which
carry Fannie and Freddie’s guarantee on them, are then sold to investors
(banks, insurance companies, bond funds, etc.).

for the Treasury based on 10/1/10 closing price. Including this potential gain, TARP ultimate cost to the Treasury would be $29B. 2) White House OMB estimates
ultimate cash cost of Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac at $165B while the CBO estimates the ultimate cash costs at $160B. Both estimates imply an average default rate of
5-10% on Fannie Mae + Freddie Mac’s $5T loan guarantee portfolio and a loss severity of 50%. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) estimates ultimate

USA Inc. Net Worth:
-$44 Trillion in Perspective
There are doubts about the accuracy of such a big negative number, especially when the value
of USA Inc.’s assets is so hard to calculate. The value of natural resources, the power to tax,
the ability to print the world’s reserve currency, the human capital in our educational system –
these and other assets would clearly reduce that number, if they could be accurately
calculated.
Given the differences between government and corporate accounting, what matters is not the
exact number, but the trend – which is clearly moving in the wrong direction. Liabilities have
been growing faster than assets. Just to put that $57 trillion into context…

Important Caveats on F2010 Medicare Liability Improvement
�
�
�
Medicare Part A and Part B unfunded liability improved to -$16 trillion in F2010, up 47% from -$31 trillion in
F2009, per the Board of Medicare Trustees.
The improvement was driven primarily by downward revisions of future cost growth assumptions following
enactment of healthcare reform in 2010.
However, Medicare’s Chief Actuary Richard Foster noted that “while the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, as amended, makes important changes to the Medicare program and substantially improves its
financial outlook, there is a strong likelihood that certain of these changes will not be viable in the
long range…Without major changes in health care delivery systems, the prices paid by Medicare for health
services [as scheduled by current law] are very likely to fall increasingly short of the costs of providing these
services…Congress would have to intervene to prevent the withdrawal of providers from the Medicare
market and the severe problems with beneficiary access to care that would result. Overriding the productivity
adjustments, as Congress has done repeatedly in the case of physician payment rates, would lead to far
higher costs for Medicare in the long range than those projected under current law…For these
reasons, the financial projections shown [here] for Medicare do not represent a reasonable
expectation for actual program operations in either the short range (as a result of the unsustainable
reductions in physician payment rates) or the long range (because of the strong likelihood that the statutory
reductions in price updates for most categories of Medicare provider services will not be viable).”

Balance Sheet: Observations of Last Ten Years
� Unfunded promise of future entitlement spending grew 6x to -$31
trillion, owing to rapidly rising healthcare cost + new Medicare Part D
program + aging population in the medium-future.
� Federal net debt outstanding more than doubled to $9 trillion on the
back of chronic budget deficits, two major recessions in 2001 and 2008,
and growing entitlement spending.
� Federal employee & veteran benefits outstanding also more than
doubled, to $5.7 trillion, thanks to rising healthcare costs and ongoing

Empowered to Improve USA Inc.’s
Financials—Consider?
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider?
221
First, Examine USA Inc. Key Drivers of Revenue & Expenses…
� USA Inc.'s Revenue = Highly Correlated (83%) with GDP Growth*
� 90% of USA Inc.'s 2010 revenue derived from taxing individual and corporate
income, which depends on GDP growth and changes to tax rates / composition.
� USA Inc.'s Expenses = Less (73%) Correlated with GDP Growth*
� Entitlement Programs = 57% of USA Inc.'s expenses in 2010
� driven by government policy + demographic changes
� Defense Programs = 20% of expenses
� driven by external threat levels and policy
� Net Interest Payments = 6% of expenses
� driven by net debt level + interest rates + composition of debt maturity
Observation: while revenue is highly correlated with GDP growth, expenses
are less so.
www.kpcb.com
Note: *Historical inflation-adjusted correlation between GDP and revenue / expense Y/Y growth rates from 1940 to 2010, GDP / revenue
adjusted using GDP deflator; expenses adjusted using White House OMB’s composite outlay deflator. Nominal revenue / GDP correlation
over the same period is 84%; expense / GDP correlation is 71%. Data source: White House Office of Management & Budget, CBO.
USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 222
Then, Aim to Determine What ‘Normal’ Is…
� We review 40-year income statement patterns and focus on
‘average’ / ‘normal’ levels of USA Inc.’s revenue drivers
(primarily related to taxes) and expense drivers (by category)
as a percent of revenue, as a starting point to help define
‘average’ / ‘normal.’
� Established businesses typically determine their expense
levels based on their revenue trend / outlook.
� In a perfect world, the government (and its citizens) would
continually review the multiple variables in the income
statement of USA Inc. (in a bipartisan way) and would
work hard to foster compromise, in order to optimize
revenue and expenses for the long term AND the short term.

Revenue Growth: Observations from Previous Slide
� We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of
revenue and expenses. We did not choose the most recent 40-year period (1969
to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent significant
tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969 and subsequently many metrics (like individual
income and corporate profit) varied significantly from ‘normal’ levels.
� Total USA Inc. revenue (collected via taxes) has grown at an average 3%
annual rate, in-line with 40-year GDP growth rate. Corporate taxes have – on
average – grown at 2% annually over 40 years. Social insurance taxes (for
Social Security and Medicare) have grown at an average 5% annual rate,
above the 3% GDP growth.
Questions:
1) How crucial is the role played by lower relative tax rates – especially for
corporations – in stimulating job and GDP growth and helping American maintain /
gain / constrain loss of global competitive advantage?
� 2) Should social insurance tax growth be more closely aligned with GDP growth?

Revenue Drivers as Percent of Revenue:
Observations from Previous Slide
� Social Insurance taxes (for entitlement programs) have risen materially
to 37% of revenue (vs. 33% 40-year average), and have risen
aggressively from 19% in 1965, owing to introduction of Medicare in
1965 and the 1983 reform of social security taxes.
� Questions:
1) What level of social insurance / entitlement ‘tax’ can USA Inc. support on
an on-going basis? Rising from 19% of revenue in 1965 to 33% of revenue
in 2005 – of which 75% was spent on healthcare – takes its toll on other
areas of spending / growth. There are serious tradeoffs - every dollar that
goes to entitlement programs is not spent on education, infrastructure, and
defense.
� 2) Why have corporate income taxes fallen to 13% of revenue in 2009 from
22% in 1965 aside from recession? How crucial has this been to maintain
global competitive advantage and stimulating American job and GDP
growth?

payments have risen 3%, and defense plus non-defense discretionary
spending (including education, infrastructure, law enforcement and
judiciary) have risen by 1%. These different growth rates have become
even more pronounced in recent years.
� Questions:
1) Isn’t it time for a re-set and acknowledgment of trade-offs? Should taxes,
non-defense discretionary spending, and defense spending grow in line with
GDP over time? Should entitlement spending be restructured to be more
efficient and supportable by the ongoing financial dynamics of USA, Inc. and
also grow in line with or below GDP?

Category Expenses as Percent of Expenses:
Observations from Previous Slide
� Entitlement spending has risen to 51% of total spending, higher than 40-
year average of 42% (and much higher than the 21% in 1965), defense
spending has fallen to 20% from 24% average, non-defense discretionary
spending (including education, infrastructure, energy, law enforcement
and veteran services) has fallen to 22% from 23%, and net interest
payments have fallen to 7% from 11%, despite higher debt (largely because
of declining interest rates). These trends have become more pronounced
in recent years.
� Questions:
1) Should entitlement spending account for 51% (and rising) share of total USA
Inc.’s spending, while other key areas (such as education, infrastructure, energy,
law enforcement…) account for only 22% (and falling) of spending?

Bottom Line, as Data in This Presentation Indicate…
� USA Inc.’s expenses far exceed revenue – and government
projections imply this trend will get worse, not better.
�
In addition - while not addressed in depth in this presentation - USA Inc.
(while still a global powerhouse), at the margin, is losing competitive
advantage to many other countries.
� Instead of ignoring the problems, we simply ask the question…
How would a financial / turnaround expert look at USA Inc.’s financials,
business model, strategic plans, efficiency and aim to drive the
‘business’ to break-even (or a modest profit) over the next
5-10 years?
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider?
233
Matching Expenses & Revenue:
Imperatives & Constraints
There are many reasons to make changes
� USA Inc. is losing money, and forecasts imply it will continue to lose money.
� Net debt levels (62% in F2010) are expected to surpass 90% threshold* – above
which real GDP growth could slow by more than one percentage point – by 2021E.
� Spending (primarily related to entitlement programs) is at unsustainable levels
based on USA Inc.’s ability to fund the spending (without increasing debt levels).
� Americans rank ‘reducing America’s debt’ as one of country’s top priorities,
according to a national survey by Peter G. Peterson Foundation in 11/09.
� We are now in the midst of a major generational baton-passing (from the Baby
Boomers to Generation X) which requires preparation for policy change.
� Foreigners own 46% (and rising) of USA Inc.’s debt, per Treasury Department –
Are they going to keep funding USA Inc.’s spending?
Note: *Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the relationship between government debt
and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average
growth falls considerably more. We note that while Reinhart and Rogoff’s observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer
to the European countries’ definition of government gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10.

USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 234

Matching Expenses & Revenue:
Imperatives & Constraints
There are many constraints to making changes
� ~90 million citizens (29% of Americans) 1 have grown accustomed to entitlement
programs - 47MM on Medicaid, 45MM on Medicare, and 51MM on Social
Security, and many of them vote.
� Politicians depend on re-election campaigns, which can create conflicts,
especially given that only 12% of the population are willing to cut Social Security
and Medicare benefits, per Pew survey in 2/11.
� Low personal savings rates (near 6% of disposable income in CQ2:10), high
unemployment (near 10%) and economic uncertainty, which can limit ability to
make radical change.
� 14 million healthcare-related workers 2 have grown accustomed to relatively high
healthcare spending.

235
And Then There’s the Constraint of
USA Inc.’s Weak Economy
� [The] typical error most countries make coming out of a
financial crisis is they shift too quickly to premature restraint.
You saw that in the United States in the 30s, you saw that in
Japan in the 90s. It is very important for us to avoid that
mistake. If the government does nothing going forward, then
the impact of policy in Washington will shift from supporting
economic growth to hurting economic growth.

Negative Cash Flow =

� Negative cash flow implies that USA Inc. can't afford the
services it is providing to 'customers' (citizens).
� USA Inc. needs to re-prioritize its services and offer
them in a more cost-effective way to stop losing (and
borrowing) money.

The First Step to a 'Turnaround' is Acknowledging
There is a Problem
� A turnaround situation is first recognized when there is serious concern
or dissatisfaction with the firm's [organization's] performance, results,
and/or near-term forecasts of [financial] performance and results.

- Richard Sloma, The Turnaround Manager's Handbook
� If your organization is in trouble, be honest. Make it absolutely clear to

How Might a 'Turnaround Expert' Look at an Organization that
Needs to be 'Turned Around?'
� The recovery of a [challenged] company [or country]…depends on the
implementation of an appropriate rescue plan or turnaround prescription.
Characteristics of the appropriate remedy are that it must: 1) address the
fundamental problems; 2) tackle the underlying causes (rather than the
symptoms) and 3) be broad and deep enough in scope to resolve all the
key issues.

How does USA Inc. measure performance and progress – are tools in place to measure success / failure?
Should USA Inc. empower an independent / 3rd party auditor with expertise in government operations
around the world AND corporate turnarounds to conduct a broad-ranging audit of USA Inc.’s operations to
measure efficiency and productivity of each business lines?
Does USA Inc. have tight management and financial controls?
What is the best way to measure and improve individual program performance? Can Congress, the
administration and the agencies agree on common metrics?
Are there operations that should be centralized (like procurement, human resources, employee payroll and
benefits) and decentralized?
Are there operations that USA Inc. can outsource to local private companies to improve efficiency and
reduce costs?
Where should USA Inc. increase and or decrease investment?
Is USA Inc. investing for the future in a responsible way?
Should USA Inc. drive public / private partnership in infrastructure investment with collective ‘skin in the
game?’
Is the organization leveraging technology to improve productivity and connect with customers and suppliers?
How can USA Inc. improve business process related to time, cost and quality?
Does USA Inc. own assets it doesn't need that it can sell at attractive prices?

Three Principles for a USA Inc. ‘Turnaround’
from Louis Gerstner
�
Do not impose across-the-board cost reductions
�
This is a simple and tempting remedy for an organization in fiscal trouble. But it is almost always
unproductive. A truly effective organization needs incremental investments in programs that drive
innovation and higher productivity. Moreover, across-the-board cuts are almost guaranteed to reduce
morale, promote short-sighted choices, and encourage accounting gimmicks that send people looking for
loopholes instead of creative solutions.
�
Focus on programs, not costs
�
The greatest productivity gains come from asking questions such as: What things are we doing now that
we do not need as much in the future? Can we eliminate them? Reduce their size? Provide them in a
totally restructured fashion?
�
Allow no exceptions
�
To drive a truly effective restructuring program, everything must be on the table. There can be no sacred
cows—no part of the organization that is exempt from scrutiny. Every unit of the organization may not
face a cut, but every unit needs to be rethought.

Financial Experts Tend to ‘Assume What Can Go Wrong,
Will Go Wrong,’ and Usually Manage Expenses in that Way
�
In projecting scenarios, financial experts would note that USA Inc.’s revenue and expenses are highly
correlated to economic changes – for example, a 0.1 percentage point slowdown in real GDP annual
growth rate could worsen USA Inc.’s F2011-F2020E budget deficit by $288B, or 5% owing to lower tax
revenue and higher welfare spending.

Note: Medicaid funding is appropriated by Congress (from general tax revenue) on an as-needed basis every year, therefore,
there is no need to maintain a contingency reserve, and, unlike Medicare, the “financial status” of the program is not in question
from an actuarial perspective. Here we estimated the net present value of future Medicaid spending through 2085E, assuming a
3% discount rate. Data source: Dept. of Treasury, Dept. of Health & Human Services Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

USA Inc.’s Financial Disconnect
� The country faces a fundamental disconnect between the
services the people expect the government to provide,
particularly in the form of benefits for older Americans, and
the tax revenues that people are willing to send to the
government to finance those services. That fundamental
disconnect will have to be addressed in some way if the
budget is to be placed on a sustainable course.
� - Douglas Elmendorf, Director of U.S. Congressional Budget Office, 11/10/2009

An Observation from Ben Bernanke,
Current Chairman of the Federal Reserve
� A famous economist once said anything that can’t go on
forever will eventually stop, and this [government liabilities
from entitlement programs] will stop, but it might stop in a
very unpleasant way in terms of sharp cuts, a financial crisis,
high interest rates that stop growth, continued borrowing
from abroad. So, clearly we need to get control of this over
the medium term, and specifically we’re going to have to
look at entitlements because that’s a very big part of the
obligations of the federal government going forward.

Good News: While ‘Unfunded’ Liabilities Have Helped Bankrupt Companies,
USA Inc.'s Unfunded Liabilities are Not Legal Contracts
� Medicare / Social Security – While beneficiaries have a legal
entitlement to receive benefits as set forth under the Social Security Act,
Congress has the legal authority to change the levels of benefits
and/or the conditions under which they are paid. Congress’s
authority to modify provisions of the Social Security program was
affirmed in the 1960 Supreme Court decision in Flemming v. Nestor,
wherein the Court held that an individual does not have an accrued
“property right” in Social Security benefits. The Court has made clear in
subsequent decisions that the payment of Social Security taxes conveys
no contractual rights to Social Security benefits.
� Medicaid – Benefit levels & eligibility are determined jointly by Federal
and State governments. Federal funding is met through an appropriation
by Congress (and can be adjusted annually).

Good News: Mathematical Illustrations to Fix Social Security’s
Financial Problems Do Not Seem Drastic
In fact, when Social Security was nearing bankruptcy in 1983, a
combination of moderate reforms led to 25 consecutive years of
operating surpluses.
� Highlights of 1983 Social Security Reform
� 1) Raised full retirement age to 67 by 2027 (from 65)*
� 2) Reduced annual benefits by 5% (via a 6-month delay in cost-of-living
adjustment in 1983 & subsequent changes in benefit formulas and tax
schemes) .
� 3) Raised Social Security tax rates by 2.3% (via an advancement in
scheduled tax increase).
� 4) Made Social Security benefits (up to 50%) taxable income.
www.kpcb.com
Note: *For people born in 1937 or earlier, full retirement age (with 100% Social Security benefit) remained at 65. For people
born after 1960, full retirement age was raised to 67. For people born between 1937 and 1960, the full retirement age
progressively increases from 65 to 67. Source: Social Security Administration archive.

� 2) Increase Medicare tax rate from 2.9% to 6.8%? and/or
� 3) Some combination of all / some the above
� However you look at it, this math is draconian. A 53% cut in
Medicare benefits and / or more than doubling taxes are unrealistic.
The situation for Medicaid is even worse, as Medicaid has no
dedicated funding source.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Incentives Support Healthcare Cost Growth
• Consumers demand healthcare services with less regard
for the full economic impact as they pay only a fraction of
the true cost out of pocket.
• Healthcare service providers are generally rewarded for
pushing more services through the system, largely with
relatively less regard for cost effectiveness.
Bottom line = Powerful forces encourage spending
related to social / economic / legal issues throughout
the healthcare system.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Social + Economic + Legal Factors
Drive Incentives to Spend
1) Social – Growing + aging population (with related
disproportionate spending on end-of-life care) and unhealthy
lifestyles.
2) Economic – Healthcare service providers have financial
incentives to perform more services and drive revenue while
consumers often have little incentive to manage incremental
cost.
3) Legal - Rising overhead from defensive medicine (to avoid
lawsuits) and from regulatory compliance costs.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Forces that Push Up
Healthcare Spending
1) Open access healthcare plans can increase access to care
(via greater choices of care providers), but can also
increase cost.
2) Consumers and providers are not always incentivized to
constrain their healthcare costs.
3) Even when appropriate, poor information & lack of price
transparency complicate comparison shopping for
consumers.
4) Advances in medical technology drive demand and costs.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors –
Employer and Government Funding System Separates Consumers from
True Costs of Healthcare
� When one doesn’t pay directly and gets an expensive good / service for
free (or well below cost), one tends to consume more – it’s basic supply
and demand economics.
� Count up the subsidies:
� Medicaid: 47 million (24MM children / 12MM low-income adults / 7MM
disabled / 4MM elderly) Americans (15% of population) each received $6,872
in taxpayer funds, on average, for healthcare in 2008 through Medicaid. That
$6,872 equals ~19% of annual per-capita income for Americans.
� Medicare: 45 million elderly Americans (15% of population) averaged $7,991
per person for healthcare in 2008 ($4,875 for hospital care; $3,116 for medical
insurance and prescription drugs). That equals ~23% of annual per capita
income.
� Private Market: 157mm Americans with private health coverage (subsidized
by employers) in 2008 paid just 16% of the total premium cost themselves for
single coverage and 27% for family coverage. In effect, that represented taxfree
“earnings” of $3,951 for singles or $9,256 for families (not including the
tax savings on their personal premium contributions).

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors—
Healthcare Providers Are Rewarded for Driving Revenue
• While striving to provide the best care possible, healthcare
providers tend to have financial / legal / societal incentives to
provide more care, all else equal.
• Reimbursement for providers is generally volume-based (e.g., more
procedures generate more revenue for care providers), though there
are efforts to increasingly focus on quality.
• Unlike car buyers, for example, who often disregard a dealer’s
maxed-out model and choose only the features that are important to
them and what they can afford, healthcare buyers tend to buy all the
“features” as: 1) buyers (patients in this case) are typically not
medical experts, so they defer to doctors / care providers for
decisions; and 2) buyers only bear a small portion of the costs as
someone else (employer or government) is paying for the features.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors—
Poor Information & Lack of Price Transparency
Make it Harder for Consumers to “Comparison Shop”
Patients are at a healthcare information disadvantage in two respects 1 :
• Lack of transparency:
‣ It’s harder for consumers to compare prices of healthcare services from
different healthcare providers than in other consumer markets given the
complexity of healthcare market.
‣ With employer- / government-subsidized insurance, many patients are
‘locked in’ with their insurance plans that do not incentivize “shopping
around.”
• Knowledge gap:
‣ Unlike other markets where consumers tend to use their own information and
preferences, consumers depend more on the advice and guidance of
physicians or other healthcare suppliers.
‣ Unlike other “merchandise,” healthcare is literally of life-and-death
importance to consumers, making risk aversion – and price
insensitivity – higher. This price insensitivity is exacerbated because the
consumer, in effect, gets it at a discounted price anyway.

� More widespread adoption of healthcare information technology, in particular
clinical decision support software, should yield better information and provider
decisions.
� Healthcare is at the cusp of leveraging decision-support technology after
historically lagging other industries.
� Opportunity to develop best practices to improve patient care and outcomes
and reduce medical errors and costs.
� More evidence-based care could help to narrow the variation in practice norms
� The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided approximately
$19 billion for Medicare and Medicaid Health IT incentives.
� Medpac summarizes the opportunities and issues succinctly.
