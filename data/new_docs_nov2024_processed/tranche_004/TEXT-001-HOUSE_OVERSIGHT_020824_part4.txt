� Drivers of investment in IT include the promise of quality and efficiency gains.
Barriers include the cost and complexity of IT implementation, which often
necessitates significant work process and cultural changes. Certain
characteristics of the health care market—including payment policies that
reward volume rather than quality, and a fragmented delivery system—can also
pose barriers to IT adoption.

…Opportunity for Two Mutually Reinforcing Cycles:
Information + Incentives
� Improving incentives for providers and consumers is also critical.
� Providers need appropriate incentives to improve quality of care and lower
costs.
� Drivers include more widespread adoption of bundled payments and
accountable care organizations.
� Tort reform could play an important role.
� Consumers need to take more responsibility for their own health and to utilize
the healthcare system appropriately.
� Appropriate social and financial incentives are key.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors–Possible Solutions

4) Deploy Cost-Benefit Analysis for Medical
Technology Spending

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors–Possible Solutions
1) Cost-Sharing
• Cost-sharing can help control demand for a portion of healthcare by creating
incentives for consumers to shop for most cost-effective treatments (although those
benefits would be somewhat mitigated by the skew in health spending toward high
users).
• Once again, a Math Problem: Consider a routine physician office visit in which a provider
suggests and / or patient requests various tests, procedures, etc.
• Patient #1 covered by a plan with a $20 co-pay (i.e., a flat fee regardless of the level or
intensity of care performed during the visit)
• Patient #2 covered by a plan with a 10% co-insurance for in-network care (i.e.,
responsible for 10% of the aggregate billed charges)
• Clearly, patient #2 will become more sensitive to necessity and cost of care beyond a
level of $200 of total healthcare services
• Note that deductibles drive similar dynamic as a co-pay: once the deductible is met, the
member has little or no “skin in the game”
• Only 14-18% of employer-sponsored health insurance plans use pro-rata cost sharing (i.e.
co-insurance in example #2 above). Most (77%) insurance plans only use a co-pay (in
example #1), which gives consumers little incentive to shop the most cost-effective treatment
path.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors–Possible Solutions
2) Reimbursement Reform
Reimbursement reform could help shift drivers of payment from quantity of
care to quality of care. The following list provides a few options to consider.
• Bundled Payments: Providers get a fixed budget to treat an episode of care (i.e. a broken
hip). Exceeding the budget means providers absorb additional costs; staying under it lets
provider benefit from savings.
• Examples: PROMETHEUS Payment System 1 , Medicare Acute Care Episode
Demonstration 2
• Global payment system 3 (i.e., capitation): Providers are paid up-front to provide care that their
patient receives over a period, incentivizing them to manage costs and quality. This global
payment is adjusted periodically to reward accessible and high-quality care.
• Pay for performance 4 : Reimbursement for care providers varies, based on various quality and
efficiency measures such as discharge rate and readmission rate.
• Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs): Provider groups accept responsibility for the cost
and quality of care for a specific population of patients 5
• The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes regulations
supporting the creation of Accountable Care Organizations
• Other models often discussed to improve coordination / efficiency and reduce costs : 1)
integrated delivery systems; 2) multispecialty group practices; 3) physician-hospital
organizations; 4) independent practice associations; 5) virtual physician organizations

3) Improving Cost & Quality Transparency
• Improving cost and quality transparency of healthcare services could help
doctors and patients make more informed decisions for each situation.
• Though enhancing competition and price transparency in healthcare is not
easy, 1 new models for encouraging “comparison shopping” are emerging:
• Castlight Health, a start-up financed by venture capitalists and the
Cleveland Clinic, is working to build a search engine for healthcare prices 2
• Other services beginning to publish price information: Thomson Reuters,
Change: healthcare, and health insurers (e.g., the Aetna Navigator) 2
• A 2007 study by Deloitte proposes a “Price Transparency Checklist for
States”:
• provide prices for services that matter to consumers
• make it easy to understand
• keep care providers, insurance & pharmaceutical companies engaged and informed
• provide price and quality measures
• keep expanding price transparency initiatives
• maintain methodological rigor
• promote access and use of price information
• evaluate impact and ROI

4) Deploy Cost-Benefit Analysis for Medical Technology Spending
� Deploying cost-benefit analysis for medical technology
spending can help ensure we are spending resources wisely.
� Directly measuring the impact of new technology on total
healthcare spending – and its true value – is very difficult 1
� The Kaiser Foundation outlines some of the more common policy
suggestions for dealing with this driver of costs:
� Cost-effectiveness analysis (i.e., comparative effectiveness)
� Rationing (unlikely to be adopted owing to political sensitivity),
regulation, budget-driven constraints (used by other countries
but generally not popular in the U.S.)
� Market-based rationing (consumer-driven healthcare, pay-forperformance,
information technology)

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Legal Factors—
“Defensive Medicine” Drives up Healthcare Spending
• Defensive Medicine consists of procedures or tests that a doctor
orders to avoid possible future malpractice lawsuits.
• The practice is prevalent among US physicians and is contributing
factor to healthcare spending. According to a survey of 824
physicians in 2005 1 :
• 93% said they had engaged in the practice of Defensive Medicine
• 59% said they often ordered more diagnostic tests than medically
necessary
• 52% said they referred patients to other specialists in unnecessary
circumstances
• 33% said they often prescribed more medications than medically
necessary

Ways to control costs from tort litigation without jeopardizing patient
health
The CBO listed a package of tort reform proposals (10/09):
� Cap of $250,000 on awards for noneconomic damages for malpractice
� Cap on awards for punitive damages of $500,000 or twice the award for
economic damages, whichever is greater
� Modification of the “collateral source” rule to allow evidence of income from
such sources as health and life insurance, workers’ compensation, and
automobile insurance and subtract it from jury awards
� A statute of limitations – one year for adults and three years for children –
from the date of discovery of an injury
� Replacement of joint-and-several liability with fair-share rule: Defendants
would be liable only for the percentage of a final award equal to their share of
responsibility

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Legal Factors—Possible Solution
Tort Reform Could Save USA Inc. $54 Billion Over Next 10 Years
• CBO estimates that a package of typical tort reform proposals could
reduce total US health spending by 0.5% annually:
� Direct savings: Roughly 0.2% of this reduction stems from lower national
premiums for medical malpractice insurance.
� Indirect savings: Another 0.3% stems from slightly lower utilization of
services related to defensive medicine.
• Over 10 years, CBO estimated tort reform could reduce net healthcare
spending by $54 billion:
• Spending for Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program,
and Federal Employees Health Benefits could fall ~$41 billion over the
next decade (with the greatest savings in Medicare).
• Federal tax revenues could rise by ~$13 billion as lower health insurance
costs for employers could lead to higher take-home pay for employees
and therefore higher income taxes for USA Inc.

Both clinical effectiveness and relative cost (cost-benefit analysis).
� Without rigorous data about comparative effectiveness, according to the CBO:
�
�
Treatment decisions often depend on anecdotal evidence, conjecture, and the
experience/judgment of involved physicians.
Treatments and types of care vary widely from one area of the country to another.
� To affect healthcare spending meaningfully, comparative effectiveness must alter
doctor and patient behavior, potentially through reimbursement scheme changes, the
CBO notes.
� Note that by law, Medicare is effectively precluded from considering costs when
making coverage decisions.

� Increase premiums (or further increase cost-sharing)
� Overhaul the fee-for-service system
� Develop a premium support system for Medicare
� Add a robust public option and/or all-payer system in the exchange
� Further expand authority of the Independent Payment Advisory
Board (IPAB)*
Note: IPAB is a 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board established under PPACA with significant authority with respect to Medicare payment rates.
Beginning in 2014, in any year in which the Medicare per capita growth rate exceeded a target growth rate, the IPAB would be required to recommend
Medicare spending reductions. The recommendations would become law unless Congress passed an alternative proposal that achieved the same level of

At a High Level, With Focus on Improving Operating Efficiency,
USA Inc. Might Consider Ways to Do Things Like…
� Consider empowering an independent / 3 rd party auditor with expertise in government
operations around the world / corporate turnarounds to conduct a broad-ranging audit of
USA Inc.’s operations.
� Restore strong rules for budget process: Require annual budget resolutions and
reconciliation; PAYGO* to limit spending, enforce annual appropriations process consider
biennial budgeting.
� Consider giving the President ‘line-item’ veto / rescission authority.
� Empower commissions analogous to the military base closing panels to review and
consolidate government functions and agencies, as well as aid to State and local
governments.
� Seek flexibility to manage performance and terminate poor-performing Federal employees.
� Develop flexible / long-term compensation plans including bonus payments for Federal
employees when annual budget deficit reduction goals are met.
� Privatize government real estate and other assets with little use, expanding on current
efforts to trim $3 billion in government-owned real estate.
� Identify additional opportunities to increase public/private investment, management and
operations to drive innovation and investment in infrastructure

Review Wages: A Comprehensive / Independent
Review of Federal Wages & Benefits System May Be Worthwhile
� Analysis of existing data on federal wages & benefits is controversial.
� USA Today and the Cato Institute examined simple averages of federal (excluding military)
wages & benefits vs. private sector using Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data and
concluded that federal wages & benefits are ~100% higher than private industry – wages
are 58% higher while benefits are 3x higher. 1 (March 2010, updated in August 2010)
� The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) responded that gross average comparisons are ‘unfair and
untrue.’ And when one holds education and age constant, federal employees earn slightly
less than those in the private sector on average, although the difference is not statistically
significant. 2 (March 2010)
� The Heritage Foundation, in response to OPM and OMB’s comments, released a statistical
analysis based on BEA data, and claimed that adjusting for variables such as age,
education, marital status, race, gender, size of the metropolitan area, and several others,
federal wages & benefits are 31% higher than private industry for occupations in both
government and private sector. 3 (July 2010)

Review Wages: A Turnaround Expert Would Drill Down on Compensation
Differences Between Public & Private Sectors
� In the absence of reliable, generally accepted adjustment factors,
USA Inc. needs a comprehensive 3 rd -party review of its compensation
practices.
� Most businesses constantly review their compensation practices; these
reviews typically intensify when the financials of the core business erode.
� Considerations include compensation for comparable jobs, uniqueness
of skill sets and education required for particular roles, productivity,
hours worked, regional cost of living, job security, years of service, and
financial health of the business unit.

� “Guaranteed” Pension Plan – Retirees receive predetermined monthly
retirement benefits from employers despite the funding status /
investment returns of their pension funds. Also known as defined benefit
pension plan.
� Defined Contribution Pension Plan – Retirees contribute specified
amounts to their pension funds and receive variable monthly retirement
benefits depending on investment returns. Examples include Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans.

Local Outsourcing/Consolidation: Improve Efficiency of Public Services
Through Automation / Scale / Flexibility
1. Automation – Government agencies cannot afford to perform manual
routine-based processes that can be replaced more efficiently by
technology.
2. Scale – Consolidation of non-core processes across agencies or
outsource non-core processes to local companies can deliver scale
efficiencies.
3. Flexibility – Outsourced labor enables temporary employment in
situations where hiring full-time workers would be costly and
unnecessary.

It’s Easy to Gripe About USA Inc.’s High Expense Levels…
That Said, High Expenses Could be Covered by High Revenue
� There are two primary drivers of USA Inc.’s revenue: 1) GDP growth and 2)
related tax levies on consumers and businesses.
� To bring its income statement mechanically to break-even for 2009 (excluding onetime
charges), USA Inc. would have needed to raise individual income tax rates by
~2x across-the-board to an average of ~26-30% (from ~13%) of gross income. 1 This
certainly seems draconian. And a tax increase of this nature would surely have a
significant negative impact on USA’s GDP growth as consumers would have far less
disposable income to buy goods and services.
� This brings us to a key element of USA’s financial challenges – the need to drive
economic (GDP) AND related job growth. This is not easy. A material portion of GDP
growth over the past few decades was driven by rising consumption aided by rising
leverage and we have now entered a period of de-leveraging.
� Stronger economic growth would be hugely beneficial for USA Inc.’s revenues. But
the legacy of the financial crisis – severe housing imbalances and the need to
complete the long process of writing off private mortgage debt – means that the US
recovery will probably remain slow for at least several years. The silver lining: A
booming global economy should provide a modest lift to US growth.
www.kpcb.com
Note: 1) USA Inc.’s F2009 revenue shortfall was $997B (excluding one-time discretionary spending items). F2009 total
income tax receipts from individuals were $915B. As a result, if one were to raise individual income tax rates alone to achieve
financial break-even, one would have to more than double individual income tax rates across-the-board.

Beginning in 2007, Wealth Destruction + High Unemployment Forced Consumers
to Save Again, Potentially Reducing Short-Term Demand for Goods & Services
3% average annual GDP growth (1981 - 2007) was helped as the average USA consumer:
1) Increased personal consumption as percent of GDP to 71% from 62%;
2) Decreased personal savings rate to 2% of disposable income from 11%;
Beginning in 2007, things changed as:
1) The average US consumer experienced a material decline in the value of his / her largest
investment assets (real estate and equities) from 2007 to 2009 when peak-to-trough
valuations for USA residential real estate declined 30% and the S&P 500 declined 56%;
2) Unemployment rose to 10% in 2009 / 2010 from 30-year trough of 4% in 1999, creating
uncertainty regarding future personal income levels;
3) Personal savings rate increased to 6% in 2009 / 2010 of disposable income from 2% in 2007,
as uncertainty grows and appetite for consumption ebbs;
All in, the key driver of US GDP growth – the US consumer’s ability to spend – is severely
constrained in the short term as he / she aims to rebuild savings and contain
spending. This raises the question – ‘How fast can US GDP grow annually over the
next ten years?’ Determining ways to drive GDP (and related job growth) is crucial…

Economic Policy–Short-Term vs. Long-Term
• Economic theory + experience of the Great Depression suggest
government can use fiscal policy (increase direct spending +
investment) to offset near-term shortfalls in private demand.
• In the long term, USA Inc. cannot sustain higher levels of direct
spending / investment without crowding out private consumption /
investment.
• Therefore, USA Inc. should prioritize and allocate available
resources to stimulate growth in productivity + employment, which
drive long-term GDP growth.

Each of Which Accounts for ~50% of Long-Term Real GDP Growth
� Investments in Technology / Infrastructure / Education Boost Productivity.
� Newer technology improves efficiency of communication and lowers costs of
providing goods and services.
� Better infrastructure reduces transportation costs for input and output materials
� Better education improves general labor quality and enables specialization for
more efficiency.
� Removing Restrictions / Uncertainties in Various Regulations Can
Stimulate Private Employment.
� Immigration does not reduce employment opportunities for US-born workers,
per Federal Reserve study in 8/10.
� Removing tax / regulatory uncertainty could help create hiring incentives for

For GDP Growth & Job Creation, It’s Key for Private Industry to Remain
Incentivized to Invest in R&D
� As we contemplate our future, we must accept the fact that many of the assumptions under
which business operated for the past 50 years no longer hold true…If we are committed to
investing in ideas to improve – not just maintain – what we have and what we know, the United
States will do more than just recover from this recession. We will emerge, once again, as a
competitive, global powerhouse…Innovation…accrues to countries in proportion to the quality
and rigor of their educational systems…The future of every nation will be shaped by new ideas
and creativity. These are the engines of future prosperity.
– Paul Otellini, CEO, Intel Corporation, 2/10/09
� Government targeted and ‘blue sky’ investment in technology (and defense) has led to crucial
technology inventions for America – such as ARPANET / Internet (1970s) and Global
Positioning System (1980s)..., which, on a net basis, have created jobs, wealth and related tax
revenue.
� Government investment in technology remains important, but, perhaps more important,
government must help incentivize private industry (via tax policies such as allowing companies
to repatriate overseas cash at lower tax rates 1 and other tools) to invest in domestic research &
development and to create jobs…and create a stable environment in which to operate.

Increase Employment: Structural Problems in USA Labor Force High
Healthcare Costs + Skills Mismatch + Labor Immobility
� Healthcare costs may be a barrier to hiring for employers
� Healthcare benefits = 8% of average total employee compensation; grew at 6.9%
CAGR from 1998 to 2008 compared with 4.5% CAGR in salaries.
� Healthcare benefits are fixed costs as they are paid on an annual per-worker basis
and do not vary with hours worked.
� As employers try to lower fixed costs to right-size to reduced revenue levels,
layoffs are the only way to reduce fixed healthcare costs.
� Skills mismatch may be a barrier to hiring for employers
� A large portion of the long-term unemployed may lack requisite skills.
� 14% of firms reported difficulty filling positions due to the lack of suitable talent, per
5/10 Manpower Research survey.
� Labor immobility resulting from the housing bust may be a barrier to hiring
� One in four homeowners are “trapped” because they owe more than their houses
are worth, so they cannot move to take new jobs – until they sell or walk away.

Compared to 10 Years Ago, USA is Losing Competitiveness
at the Margin vs. Its Peers
� McKinsey conducted a study in 2010 that compares the USA with other
countries on 20 attributes related to economic fundamentals, business
climate, human capital and infrastructure. McKinsey compared current
status vs. status in 2000.
� We augmented the McKinsey study with 9 additional attributes across those
aforementioned areas as well as government spending metrics.
� Through this study, we found that America, relative to other countries, improved
on none of the 29 attributes, remained the same on 9 attributes (including
GDP per capita, public debt as % of GDP, public spending on healthcare, public
spending on education, growth in local innovation clusters, population &
demographic profile, retention of foreign-born talents, total healthcare spending
and cost-adjusted labor productivity) and deteriorated on 20 (including trade
surplus, national spending on R&D, industrial production, corporate tax rate,
business environment, FDI, tax incentives for R&D, number of patent
applications, availability of high-quality labor, higher education penetration,
telecom & transportation infrastructure, etc.).

Pros + Cons of Tax Rate Hikes
� A more progressive income tax system could lower tax burden from
potential subsidy cuts and carbon taxes on the low-income population.
� Addressing income inequality may enhance perceived fairness – and
political chances – of comprehensive deficit measures.
� Across-the-board tax rate increases would hurt nearly everyone, but
especially lower-income taxpayers.
� Rate increases on upper brackets usually spur tax avoidance, and
revenues often fall short of targets.
� Rate increases, which discourage savings, amplify distortions in the
economy from tax subsidies, exclusions and tax expenditures, all of
which encourage consumption.

Mathematical Illustrations*
� 1) To eliminate F2010 deficits by increasing individual / corporate / payroll tax
rates across-the-board would require +12 percentage points of tax rate increase
(raising $1.4 trillion) – and would likely damage economic growth? or
� 2) To eliminate primary budget deficit** by F2019E by increasing top two tiers of
income tax rates would require moving marginal rates to 72% / 77% from 33% /
35% – also likely to damage growth and encourage tax avoidance? or
� 3) Broadening tax base could require reducing ‘tax expenditures’ and subsidies,
e.g., limiting deductions and subsidies for housing & healthcare?
Policy Options
Illustrating the Revenue Tradeoffs –
Changing Tax Rates vs. Broadening the Tax Base
� 1) A combination of somewhat higher rates and a broader tax base? and/or
� 2) Changing taxation of individual income to encourage saving / investment
rather than consumption (perhaps a value-added tax and/or carbon tax)? and/or
� 3) Changing taxation of corporate income to reflect global competition?
Note: *The simple tax math presented here are pure mathematical illustrations – we simply calculated how big a broad-based tax rate increase (for
individual and corporate income, as well as payroll) would have to be for USA Inc. to financial break-even. These calculations are merely mechanical
illustrations and are not meant to portray realistic solutions. **Primary budget deficit is the budget deficit excluding net interest payments.

Changing USA Inc.’s Tax System Could Help
Rebalance the Economy & Reallocate Resources
� Though there would be adjustment costs, reducing subsidies and ‘tax
expenditures’ could broaden the tax base and collect more revenue, while
allowing income tax rates to stay low or go lower.
� The current system favors consumption, penalizes saving; a tax based on
consumption (or “value added”) could offset some of that penalty, though there
are risks and drawbacks.
� Subsidies create incentives to consume more health insurance and housing –
both account for 20% of GDP, vs. 11% in 1965 1 – and take resources from other
sectors like education, technology, infrastructure.
� A worldwide corporate tax system with a lower tax rate could reduce incentives
for companies to keep income offshore.
� A carbon tax could raise some additional revenue to reduce the deficit, while
encouraging sustainable economic development.

Raising Revenue by Reducing Tax Expenditures & Subsidies: Examples
• Reducing the biggest tax expenditures and subsidies could net $1.7
trillion in additional revenue over the next decade, per CBO and the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget:
– Reduce the tax exclusion for health insurance or replace with a credit
– Cap the deduction for state and local taxes
– Gradually reduce the mortgage interest deduction or change to a credit
– Limit the tax benefit of other deductions, e.g., charitable contributions
• Some subsidies encourage saving or investment…and cutting them
could mean short-term revenue gain but a net loss over time.
Examples:
– Favorable taxation of capital gains, dividends, and pension contributions
– Exclude investment income from life insurance and annuities in taxable income
– Accelerated depreciation or expensing of capital equipment outlays

Tax Policy Options From Report of the National Commission on
Fiscal Responsibility and Reform
� Consolidate the tax code into three individual income rates (15% / 25% / 35%) and one
corporate income rate (26%)
� Eliminate the complex tax codes such as AMT 1 , PEP 2 , and Pease 3
� Triple standard deduction to $30,000 ($15,000 for individuals)
� Repeal state & local tax deduction and miscellaneous itemized deductions
� Limit mortgage deduction to exclude 2 nd residences, home equity loans, and mortgages
over $500,000
� Limit charitable deduction with floor at 2% of Adjusted Gross Income
� Cap income tax exclusion for employer-provided healthcare at the amount of the actuarial
value of Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) standard option
� Permanently extend the research tax credit for businesses
� Eliminate and modify several business tax expenditures (domestic production deduction /
LIFO 4 method of accounting / energy tax preferences for the oil and gas industry /
depreciation rules)
� International tax reform including a territorial system 5
Note: 1) AMT is the Alternative Minimum Tax; 2) PEP is Personal Exemption Phase-out designed to eliminate personal income exemptions for high earners; 3) Pease is a similar
phase-out, but instead of applying to personal exemption, it applies to most of the itemized deductions of a taxpayer’s claims (mortgage interest, charitable gifts, state & local taxes
paid, etc.); Pease is named after Representative Donald Pease (D-OH) who pushed for its enactment in 1990. 4) LIFO is ‘Last In, First Out’ which tend to reduce corporations’ income
taxes in times of inflation. 5) A territorial tax system is a tax system that taxes only income that is created within the borders of a specific territory (usually a country). Source: National
Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, “The Moment of Truth: Report of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform,” 12/1/10. Note that the Report also
identified two other scenarios called the ‘The Zero Plan’ which eliminates all tax expenditures and ‘Tax Reform Trigger’ which forces Congress to undertake comprehensive tax reform
by 2012 by raising taxes for each year Congress fails to act.

To Take a Step Back…
� We Asked the Question
�
How would public shareholders view USA Inc.?
� What Have We Found?
�
USA Inc.’s finances – short-term and long-term, income statement
and balance sheet – are challenged. Management’s policies have
created incentives to invest in healthcare, housing, and current
consumption rather than in productive capital, education, and
technology – the tools needed to compete in the global marketplace.
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc. | Consequences of Inaction 414
Consequences of Inaction – Investor Perspective
� Short Term, No Problem Yet
�
Global bond investors, in part, have looked past USA Inc.’s
deteriorating financials because growth, inflation, and Fed
purchases matter more, and because income statements and
balance sheets of many other developed countries (such as
Greece / Spain / Portugal / Ireland) are worse.
� Long Term, Consequences of Inaction Could Be Severe
�
If USA Inc.’s “managers” and “board” continue to ignore rising
unfunded entitlement spending, investors could eventually demand
a higher return to lend money to USA Inc. – leading to rising bond
yields / higher borrowing costs for USA Inc. At some point, USA
Inc.’s currency could also weaken significantly.

However, in Longer Term, Credit Rating Agencies Have Begun to Worry
About USA Inc.’s Debt Affordability
� On balance, we believe that the ratings of all large Aaa governments [including
USA Inc.] remain well positioned, although their ‘distance-to-downgrade’ has
in all cases substantially diminished…Growth alone will not resolve an
increasingly complicated debt equation…Preserving debt affordability at levels
consistent with Aaa ratings will invariably require fiscal adjustments of a
magnitude that, in some cases, will test social cohesion. 1
