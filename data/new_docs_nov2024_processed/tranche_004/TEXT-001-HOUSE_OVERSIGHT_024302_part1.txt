outstanding. Holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share of Class A common stock. Ernest Garcia II, Ernest Garcia III, and

own, for so long as the Garcia Parties maintain, in the aggregate, direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of Class A
common stock, determined on an as-exchanged basis assuming that all of the Class A common units (“Class A Units”) and Class B common units (“Class B
Units,” and together with Class A Units, “LLC Units”) of Carvana Group, LLC (“Carvana Group”) were exchanged for Class A common stock. The Garcia
Parties are currently entitled to ten votes per share of Class B common stock they beneficially own. All other holders of Class B common stock are entitled
to one vote per share. All holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class except as otherwise required by
applicable law. Cumulative voting is not permitted with respect to the election of directors or any other matter to be considered at the annual meeting.

1. FOR the election of Gregory Sullivan and Dan Quayle as Class II directors;
2. FOR the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending
December 31, 2019;
3. FOR the approval, by an advisory vote, of Carvana’s executive compensation; and
4. FOR an advisory vote that future advisory votes on executive compensation occur annually.
Q: How do I cast my vote?
BeneficialStockholders. If you hold your shares through a broker, trustee, or other nominee, you are a beneficial stockholder. To vote your
shares, please refer to the materials forwarded to you by your broker, bank, or other nominee for instructions on how to vote the shares you hold as a
beneficial stockholder.
RegisteredStockholders. If you hold shares in your own name, you are a registered stockholder and may vote by written ballot at the annual
meeting or by proxy before the annual meeting in the following ways:
1. online at www.proxypush.com/CVNA;
2. by phone by calling (866) 509-2149; or
3. by signing and returning a proxy card.
Proxies submitted online or by telephone must be received before 8:00 AM (PDT) on April 23, 2019.
Q: Can I access the proxy materials electronically?
Yes. Your notice, proxy card, or voting instruction card will contain instructions on how to view our proxy materials for the annual meeting
online and how to instruct us to send our future proxy materials to you electronically by email. Our proxy materials are also available at
www.proxypush.com/CVNA and will be available during the voting period starting on March 14, 2019.
Instead of receiving future copies of our proxy statement and annual reports by mail, stockholders of record and most beneficial owners can
elect to receive an email that will provide an electronic link to these documents. Your election to receive future proxy materials by email will remain in
effect until you revoke it.
Please note that only one notice will be sent to stockholders who are listed at the same address.

Q: How may I change or revoke my proxy?
vote.
BeneficialStockholders. Beneficial stockholders should contact their broker, trustee, or nominee for instructions on how to change their proxy
RegisteredStockholders. Registered stockholders may change a properly executed proxy at any time before its exercise by
1. delivering written notice of revocation to the general counsel and secretary at our principal executive offices at 1930 W. Rio Salado Pkwy,
Tempe, AZ 85281;
2. submitting another proxy that is dated later than the original proxy (including a proxy via telephone or internet); or
3. voting in person at the annual meeting.
Q: Who can attend the annual meeting?
Subject to space availability, all common stockholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the annual meeting.
Since seating is limited, admission to the annual meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration will begin at 7:30 AM (PDT). If you attend,
please note that you may be asked to present valid photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport.
Please also note that if you are a beneficial stockholder (that is, you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee), you will need to
bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date and check in at the registration desk at the annual meeting.
Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the annual meeting.
Q: What is the voting requirement to approve each of the items, and how are the votes counted?
ITEM1–ELECTIONOFDIRECTORS. A plurality of the votes cast by the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to elect each nominee. This means that the two nominees receiving the highest number of votes at the
annual meeting will be elected, even if those votes do not constitute a majority of the votes cast. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not impact the
election of the nominees.
ALLOTHERITEMS. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shares of common stock present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve all other items. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote on the
proposal and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote. We do not expect there to be any broker non-votes with respect to any of the proposals.

Table of Contents
Q: When will the results of the vote be announced?
The preliminary voting results will be announced at the annual meeting. The final voting results will be published in a current report on Form
8-K filed with the SEC within four business days of the annual meeting.
Q: What is the deadline for submitting a stockholder proposal or director nomination for the 2020 Annual Meeting?
Stockholder proposals pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8 for inclusion in Carvana’s proxy statement and form of proxy for Carvana’s 2020 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders must be received by Carvana at our principal executive offices at 1930 W. Rio Salado Pkwy, Tempe, AZ, 85281, no later than the

than the close of business on January 24, 2020, and not earlier than the close of business on December 25, 2019, assuming Carvana does not change the date
of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders by more than 30 days before or after the anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting. If so, Carvana will release
an updated time frame for stockholder proposals. Any stockholder proposal or director nomination must comply with the other provisions of Carvana’s

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board, which is composed of five directors. Our certificate of incorporation
provides that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our Board. Our certificate also provides that our Board will be
divided into three classes of directors, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, a class of directors
will be elected for a three-year term to succeed the class whose term is then expiring.

Ernest Garcia III I 36 President, CEO and Chairman 2017 2021
Ira Platt I 55 Director 2017 2021
We believe that in order for our Board to effectively guide us to long-term sustainable, dependable performance, it should be composed of
individuals with sophistication and experience in the many disciplines that impact our business. To best serve our stockholders, we seek to have a board
that, as a whole, is competent in key corporate disciplines, including accounting and financial acumen, business judgment, crisis management, governance,
leadership, people management, risk management, social responsibility and reputational issues, and strategy and strategic planning. Additionally, the Board
desires to have specific knowledge related to our industry, such as expertise in automotive retail and consumer finance.
The Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that all directors must, at a minimum, meet the criteria set forth in the Board’s code of
conduct and the corporate governance guidelines, which specify, among other things, that the Compensation and Nominating Committee will consider
criteria such as independence, diversity, age, skills, and experience in the context of the needs of the Board. In addressing issues of diversity in particular,
the Compensation and Nominating Committee considers a nominee’s differences in viewpoint, professional experience, background, education, skill, age,
race, gender, and national origin. The Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints is a key attribute for
a director nominee. Accordingly, to improve director diversity and best serve our stockholders, the Compensation and Nominating Committee adopted a
policy in 2019 to request that any search firm that it engages include women and minority candidates in the initial list from which the committee selects
director candidates. The Compensation and Nominating Committee also will consider a combination of factors for each director, including whether the
nominee possesses:

Table of Contents
• the ability to represent all stockholders without a conflict of interest;
• the ability to work in and promote a productive environment;
• sufficient time and willingness to fulfill the substantial duties and responsibilities of a director;
• the high level of character and integrity that we expect;
• broad professional and leadership experience and skills necessary to effectively respond to the complex issues encountered by a national,
publicly traded company; and
• the ability to apply sound and independent business judgment.
The Compensation and Nominating Committee has determined that all of our directors meet the criteria and qualifications set forth in the code
of conduct for the Board of Directors, the corporate governance guidelines and the criteria set forth above for director nominees. Moreover, each director
possesses the following critical personal qualities and attributes that we believe are essential for the proper functioning of the Board to allow it to fulfill its
duties for our stockholders: accountability, ethical leadership, governance, integrity, risk management, and sound business judgment. In addition, our
directors have the mature confidence to assess and challenge the way things are done and recommend alternative solutions, a keen awareness of our
business and the social realities of the environment in which we operate, the independence and high-performance standards necessary to fulfill the Board’s
oversight function, and the humility, professional maturity, and style to interface openly and constructively with other directors. Finally, the director
biographies below include a non-exclusive list of other key experiences and qualifications that further qualify the individual to serve on the Board. These
collective qualities, skills, experiences, and attributes are essential to our Board’s ability to exercise its oversight function for Carvana and its stockholders
and to guide the long-term sustainable, dependable performance of our business.
Subject to any earlier resignation or removal in accordance with the terms of our certificate and bylaws, our Class II directors will serve until
this our second annual meeting of stockholders, our Class III directors will serve until the third annual meeting of stockholders, and our Class I directors
will serve until our fourth annual meeting of stockholders. In addition, our certificate provides that our directors may be removed with or without cause by
the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, for
so long as the Garcia Parties are entitled to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock they hold. If the Garcia Parties are no longer entitled to ten
votes for each share of Class B common stock they hold, then our directors may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 ⁄ 3 % of
the voting power of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon.

The Compensation and Nominating Committee will consider stockholder nominations for membership on the Board. For the 2020 Annual
Meeting, nominations may be submitted to Carvana Co., 1930 W. Rio Salado Pkwy, Tempe, AZ 85281, Attn: Secretary, who will forward them to the
Chairman of the Compensation and Nominating Committee. Recommendations must be in writing and we must receive the recommendation no later than
the close of business on January 24, 2020, and not earlier than the close of business on December 25, 2019. Recommendations must also include certain
other requirements specified in our bylaws. The committee will apply the same criteria to the evaluation of those candidates as it applies to other director
candidates.
When filling a vacancy on the Board, the Compensation and Nominating Committee identifies the desired skills and experience of a new
director and nominates individuals who it believes can strengthen the Board’s capabilities and further diversify the collective experience represented by the
then-current directors. The Compensation and Nominating Committee may engage third parties to assist in the search and provide recommendations.
Pursuant to a previously informal policy formally adopted in 2019, any search firm that the committee engages is requested to include women and minority
candidates in the initial list from which the committee selects director candidates. Also, directors are generally asked to recommend candidates for the
position. The candidates would be evaluated based on the process outlined in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Compensation and Nominating
Committee charter, and the same process would be used for all candidates, including candidates recommended by stockholders.

DIRECTOR NOMINEES
Dan Quayle has served on our Board since the completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”) in 2017. Mr. Quayle has served the United
States Federal Government in various capacities: congressman, senator, and as the 44th vice president of the United States of America from 1989 to 1993.
Since 1999, Mr. Quayle has been with Cerberus Capital, a New York private investment firm. He has served as chairman of Cerberus Global Investments
since 2001. Mr. Quayle earned a B.A. degree in political science from DePauw University and a J.D. from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney
School of Law. We believe Mr. Quayle is qualified to continue to serve on our Board because of his experience as the chairman of Cerberus Global
Investments, LLC, as well as his extensive experience in the areas of government, foreign relations, and private investment.
Gregory Sullivan has served on our Board since the completion of our IPO. Mr. Sullivan is the co-founder and chief executive officer of

CONTINUING DIRECTORS
Ernest Garcia III co-founded Carvana and has served as our president and chief executive officer since our inception in 2012. Mr. Garcia is
also Chairman of the Carvana Co. Board. Prior to founding Carvana, Mr. Garcia held various roles at DriveTime from January 2007 to January 2013. From
January 2007 to December 2008, he served as a financial strategist. He was a managing director of corporate finance from December 2008 to November
2009. From November 2009 until January 2013, he served as a vice president and treasurer and director of quantitative analytics. As director of quantitative
analytics, Mr. Garcia was responsible for the firm’s ongoing development of consumer credit scoring models, and its utilization of those tools in retailvehicle-sales
deal structuring and vehicle-price optimization. Prior to DriveTime, Mr. Garcia was an associate in the Principal Transactions Group at RBS
Greenwich Capital from 2005 to 2006, where he focused on consumer-credit-based investments. Mr. Garcia holds a B.S. in management science and
engineering from Stanford University. We believe that Mr. Garcia is qualified to continue to serve on our Board because of his extensive knowledge of our
business and strategy, as well as his experience in the automotive retail industry and leadership role with us.
Ira Platt has served on our Board since the completion of our IPO in 2017. Mr. Platt has been the president of Georgiana Ventures, LLC, a

DriveTime’s board and his extensive experience in consumer finance and the automotive retail industry.
Michael Maroone has served on our Board since the completion of our IPO. Mr. Maroone is currently the CEO of Maroone U.S.A. LLC. From
July 2005 to April 2015, Mr. Maroone served on the board of AutoNation, Inc., an automotive retailer and provider of new and used vehicles and related

previously served on the Cleveland Clinic Board of Trustees and was co-chairman of the Florida Leadership Board of the Cleveland Clinic. He holds a B.S.
degree in small business management from the University of Colorado Boulder. Mr. Maroone was selected to serve on our Board because of his advisory
experience and his extensive experience in the automotive retail industry
INDEPENDENCE STATUS
The listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit
committee, and compensation committee, and nominating committee be independent and that audit committee members also satisfy independence criteria
set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.
Our Board has determined that each of our non-employee directors, including our director nominees Dan Quayle and Gregory Sullivan, meets
the requirements to be an independent director. In making this determination, our Board considered the relationships that each non-employee director has
with Carvana and all other facts and circumstances that our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence, including beneficial ownership of
our Class A common stock.
CONTROLLED COMPANY STATUS
For purposes of the corporate governance rules of the NYSE, we are a “controlled company.” Controlled companies under those rules are
companies of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company. The Garcia
Parties beneficially own more than 50% of the combined voting power of Carvana Co. Accordingly, we expect to be eligible for, but do not currently intend
to take advantage of, certain exemptions from the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. Specifically, as a “controlled company,” we would not
be required to have:
• a majority of independent directors,
• a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the
committee’s purpose and responsibilities,
• a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and
responsibilities, or
• an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees.
- 10 -
Table of Contents
In the event we choose to rely on some or all of these exemptions in the future, you would not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of
companies that are subject to all of the applicable corporate governance rules of the NYSE.
BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES
During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Board held five meetings, our Audit Committee held nine meetings, and our Compensation and
Nominating Committee held four meetings. Directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of stockholders and all or substantially all of the Board
meetings and meetings of committees on which they serve, and to spend the time needed and meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their
responsibilities. Each director attended last year’s annual meeting, 100% of the meetings of the Board during such director’s tenure, and 100% of the
meetings held by the committees of the Board on which the director served.
Our Board has an Audit Committee and a Compensation and Nominating Committee. The composition, duties and responsibilities of these

BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
The following section describes our board leadership structure, the reasons why the structure is in place at this time, the roles of various
positions, and related key governance practices. The mix of experienced independent and management directors that make up our Board, along with the
independent role of our lead director and our independent board-committee composition, benefits Carvana and its stockholders.
INDEPENDENCE;BOARDMIX
Our Board has an effective mix of independent and management directors. It is composed of four independent directors and our current
chairman and chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III.
LEADDIRECTOR
The Board believes that it is beneficial to Carvana and its stockholders to designate one of the directors as a lead director who is elected by a
majority of the Board. The lead director serves a variety of roles, including reviewing and approving Board schedules to confirm the appropriate board and
committee topics are reviewed and sufficient time is allocated to each; liaising between our chairman and chief executive officer and non-management
directors when necessary and appropriate (that said, each director has direct and regular access to the chairman and chief executive officer) and calling an
executive session of independent directors at any time consistent with the bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Michael Maroone, an independent
director and member of our Audit Committee, is currently our lead director. Mr. Maroone is an effective lead director for Carvana due to, among other
things, his independence, his board leadership experience with AutoNation, Inc., his strong strategic and financial acumen, his commitment to ethics, his
extensive knowledge of the automotive retail environment, and his deep understanding of Carvana and its business.
CHAIRMAN/CEO
With respect to the roles of chairman and CEO, the corporate governance guidelines provide that the roles may be separated or combined, and
the Board will exercise its discretion in combining or separating these positions as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances. Mr. Garcia has
been our chairman and CEO since our IPO. The Board believes that combining the roles of chairman and CEO, together with the separate, independent role
of our lead director, is currently the most effective leadership structure because Mr. Garcia has extensive knowledge and experience in a variety of relevant
areas acquired through his professional and other experiences, including automotive retail, e-commerce, consumer finance and strategic planning. This
knowledge and experience give Mr. Garcia the insight necessary to combine the responsibilities of strategic development and execution along with
management of day-to-day operations.

Table of Contents
SELF-EVALUATION
Our Compensation and Nominating Committee conducts an annual performance evaluation to determine whether the Board, its committees,
and the directors are functioning effectively. This includes survey materials as well as conversations between each director and the lead director. The
evaluation focuses on the Board’s and the committees’ contributions to Carvana and has an enhanced focus on areas in which the Board or management
believes that the Board could improve.
As part of the annual Board self-evaluation, the Board evaluates whether the current leadership structure continues to be appropriate for
Carvana and its stockholders. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the flexibility for our Board to modify our leadership structure in the future as
appropriate.
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE.
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders to file initial reports of
ownership and reports of changes in ownership of any of our securities with the SEC and us. We believe that during the 2018 fiscal year, all of our directors,
executive officers and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders complied with the requirements of Section 16(a).
RISK OVERSIGHT
The Board, as a whole and through the Audit Committee, oversees our risk management program, which is designed to identify, evaluate, and
respond to our high priority risks and opportunities. The risk management program facilitates constructive dialog at the senior management and board level
to proactively realize opportunities and manage risks. Our Audit Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing our risk management processes on
behalf of the full board. Our management, including our executive officers, is primarily responsible for managing the risks associated with the operation and
business of our company and provides regular updates to the Audit Committee and annual updates to the full board on the risk management program and
reports on the identified high priority risks and opportunities.
CODEOFETHICSANDCONDUCT
We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers, and directors, including those officers
responsible for financial reporting. Our code of business conduct and ethics is available on our website at investors.carvana.com/corporategovernance/governance-documents.
We intend to disclose any amendments to the code or waivers of its requirements on our website.

communications to other departments within Carvana. Carvana generally will not forward to the directors a communication that is primarily commercial in
nature, relates to an improper or irrelevant topic, or requests general information regarding Carvana.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Prior to our IPO, none of our directors received compensation as a director from us. We have designed our non-employee director
compensation program to achieve the following objectives:
• align directors’ interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders;
• attract and retain outstanding director candidates with diverse backgrounds and experiences; and
• recognize the substantial time commitment required to serve as a Carvana director.
The Compensation and Nominating Committee reviews the Company’s director compensation program annually. Independent directors may
not receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from us. Members of the Board who are employees of Carvana do
not receive compensation for their service on the Board. The following table presents summary information regarding the total compensation awarded to,
earned by, and paid to our non-employee directors for the year ended December 31, 2018:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
COMPANYPERFORMANCEHIGHLIGHTS
2018 was a successful year for Carvana. We had another year of triple-digit growth in unit retails sold and revenue, while making significant
progress in our gross profit per unit and EBITDA margin. Our growth has few historical precedents and makes us one of the fastest-growing technology,
consumer, or retail companies at our scale.
The highlights of our 2018 performance include:
• 113% increase in retail units sold, from 44,252 to 94,108;
• 128% revenue growth, from $859 million to $1.96 billion;

KEYCOMPENSATIONDESIGNANDDECISIONSTOLINKPAYANDPERFORMANCE
Underlying our executive compensation program is a strong belief in promoting a pay-for-performance culture. We accomplish this by linking
a significant portion of the compensation of our executive officers, including our named executive officers, to our performance. In addition, the
Compensation and Nomination Committee seeks to set challenging threshold and target performance levels that reflect our rapid growth trajectory and
business plans rather than goals based on prior years’ achievements. For each of the metrics used in our performance-based compensation plans, payouts are
earned based upon outstanding performance as measured against pre-established financial objectives.
CORPORATEGOVERNANCEHIGHLIGHTSREGARDINGEXECUTIVECOMPENSATION
We endeavor to maintain sound executive compensation policies and practices, including compensation-related corporate governance
standards, consistent with our executive compensation philosophy. The following summarizes our executive compensation and related governance policies
and practices:
- 21 -
Table of Contents
WHAT WE DO WHAT WE DO NOT DO
✓ A significant portion of compensation is “at risk” and tied to long-term
company performance
û No discretionary or guaranteed incentives payments
û No new or legacy exercise-tax gross-up provisions
✓ Annual incentive plan metrics are solely based on company performance;
awards are determined based on pre-established targets
û No option repricing without stockholder consent

✓
Market-based executive compensation levels are reviewed by
Compensation and Nominating Committee annually
Performance-measured incentive awards are subject to a compensation

Executives are prohibited from hedging
An independent compensation consultant is retained to evaluate our
executive compensation and make recommendations
We believe that we have designed executive compensation plans that effectively support our strategic and financial goals, create a culture of
teamwork, and are directly tied to the performance of the company and shareholder outcomes. We will continue to utilize rigorous governance processes to
monitor and evaluate the compensation programs as well as implement best practices in compensation governance. We welcome shareholder feedback on
our programs.
COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES
Carvana seeks to create and maintain a culture of teamwork and high performance. Our executive compensation programs are one of the tools
we utilize to accomplish this objective. Philosophically, we aim to treat our executives fairly when considering:
• the complexity of their jobs,
• the market for their executive talent,
• their individual performance,
• the financial and strategic performance of the company, and
• the need to retain the executives.
Within that framework, it is critical that we meet our objectives to:
• attract and retain the best executive talent to support our growth,
• align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders, and
• provide incentives that are linked directly to our long- and short-term strategy.
We set very challenging goals as our incentive compensation metrics and we expect that our executives will in aggregate be paid approximately
at the median for achieving those goals through the plans outlined in this CD&A. As evidenced by our track record of growth and strategic progress, our
approach to executive compensation has been effective.

COMPENSATION SETTING PROCESS
ROLEOFCOMPENSATIONANDNOMINATINGCOMMITTEEANDCHIEFEXECUTIVEOFFICERINSETTINGEXECUTIVECOMPENSATION
The Compensation and Nominating Committee has responsibility for overseeing the design, development, and implementation of the
compensation program for our chief executive officer and other NEOs. The committee evaluates the performance of our chief executive officer and the
performance of the other executive officers. Our chief executive officer assists the committee in evaluating the performance of our other executive officers,
including the named executive officers other than the chief executive officer. Our chief executive officer does not participate in portions of committee
meetings or meetings of the Board when his compensation is discussed and determined, and has requested that his total compensation be set significantly
below the market median due to his significant ownership interest in our company
Based on these assessments, the members of the Compensation and Nominating Committee, each of whom is an independent director, make the
final compensation decisions for the NEOs other than the CEO, and make recommendations to the Board for the CEO’s compensation. The Board makes
the final decision for the CEO’s compensation.
INDEPENDENTCOMPENSATIONADVISOR
Our Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that independent advice is important in developing Carvana’s executive compensation
programs. Since September 2017, the committee has engaged Korn Ferry as its independent compensation consultant to advise on executive compensation
matters. All work performed by the independent compensation consultant regarding our executive compensation program is tasked and overseen directly by
the committee. Our management provides information and analyses to the committee at the committee’s direction.
In addition to advising on our executive compensation program, Korn Ferry, at the request of and in service to the committee, provided certain
other compensation advisory services for 2018 compensation, including assistance with establishing a compensation peer group, benchmarking aggregate
broad-based equity usage (including run-rate and total dilution), benchmarking director compensation, benchmarking
non-executive employee compensation in certain job families within our company, and developing the narrative disclosure in this Compensation Discussion
and Analysis. Our Compensation and Nominating Committee paid Korn Ferry $103,000 for their 2018 services.
Korn Ferry does not provide any other material services to Carvana Co. The committee has assessed the independence of Korn Ferry pursuant
to the NYSE rules and concluded that Korn Ferry’s work for the committee did not raise any conflicts of interest.

Table of Contents
COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Our executive compensation program is designed so that the sum of base pay plus total short- and long-term compensation is competitive with
market practices. Market practices—or benchmarks—are based on peer-group data and compensation survey data.
The past year, 2018, was our first year of developing a compensation peer group. Many of our direct industry competitors are either privately
held companies or are larger than us in revenue size, although very few have our growth trajectory. The Compensation and Nominating Committee, with the
assistance of its compensation consultant, Korn Ferry, reviewed and selected potential peer companies based on revenue size, industry focus, growth rates,
complexity of operations, customer base, and market for talent. With the assistance of its compensation consultant, the committee approved the following
compensation peer group in order to determine market pay levels and pay practices for fiscal year 2018:
• 1-800-Flowers.com, Inc.
• America’s Car-Mart, Inc.
• Cars.com Inc.
• Etsy, Inc.
• Grubhub, Inc.
• MarineMax, Inc.
• Monro, Inc.
• Overstock.com, Inc.
• RH
• Sleep Number Corporation
• TrueCar, Inc.
• U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc.
• Wayfair Inc.
• Zillow Group, Inc.
Going forward, the Compensation and Nominating Committee expects to review our compensation peer group on an annual basis for continued
appropriateness, considering changes in both our size and business and the businesses of the companies in the peer group.
The committee also uses compensation survey data in its evaluation of executive pay for the NEOs. Survey data provides insight into positions
that may not generally be reported in proxy statements and information about the compensation of executives of non-public companies. To assist the
committee in evaluating fiscal year 2018 compensation levels, the committee reviewed both peer-group proxy data and information from survey databases,
utilizing appropriate subsets based on the size of the company.
COMPENSATION COMPONENTS
In accordance with our overall compensation philosophy and program, executives are provided with a mix of base salary, short-term incentives,
long-term incentives and employee benefits. Our compensation philosophy places a significant portion of the potential total compensation for each NEO “at
risk” such that compensation will vary based on performance of Carvana. Variable compensation is a component of compensation for most of our
employees, but a higher proportion of our NEOs’ compensation is at risk than that of our general employee population. As shown in the pay mix chart
below, our compensation program is designed to be highly performance-based with approximately 80% of each of our NEO’s compensation tied to our
financial performance and stock price performance.

BASESALARY
The base salaries for the named executive officers are reviewed annually by the Compensation and Nominating Committee. Individual salaries
are determined based upon a combination of factors, including the scope of responsibilities, individual performance and experience, our company’s
performance, an individual’s potential for making contributions to future company performance, and competitive pay practices. The committee considers all
these factors in determining base salary increases and does not assign a specific weighting to any individual factor.
In February 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee reviewed the base salaries of our executive officers, including our named
executive officers, taking into consideration the factors described above. Following this review, the committee determined to maintain the base salary of our
CEO at its 2017 level and to increase the base salaries of the other four named executive officers to maintain the competitiveness of this compensation
element. All of the NEOs’ 2018 base salaries were approximately at or below the market median as determined by the compensation consultant.
Ernest Garcia III, our chief executive officer, had a base salary of $400,000 for both 2017 and 2018, with no increase. Mark Jenkins, our chief
financial officer, had a 2017 base salary of $350,000 and a 2018 base salary of $375,000, an increase of 7.1%. Benjamin Huston, our chief operating officer,
had a 2017 base salary of $350,000 and a 2018 base salary of $375,000, an increase of 7.1%. Ryan Keeton, our chief brand officer, had a 2017 base salary
of $315,000 and a 2018 base salary of $330,000, an increase of 4.8%. Daniel Gill, our chief product officer, had a 2017 base salary of $315,000 and a 2018
base salary of $330,000, an increase of 4.8%.
2018ANNUALINCENTIVEPLAN
Our annual incentive plan was designed to align our executive officers’ incentives with our company goals and, therefore, to be aligned with the
interests of our shareholders. The Compensation and Nominating Committee approves which executives are eligible to participate (other than the CEO) and
the level of potential awards, identifies appropriate performance measures, and determines the financial targets of each measure. The CEO makes
recommendations as to these matters, but the Compensation and Nominating Committee makes all decisions with respect to the implementation of the
annual incentive plan. For the CEO’s annual incentive plan, the Compensation and Nominating Committee makes a recommendation, with the Board
making the final decision. In establishing performance goals, the committee and the Board as a whole review industry and market conditions, alignment of
the goals with our strategy, projected general economic conditions, and both our past and forecasted performance levels.
TargetBonusesandPayoutRanges
For the 2018 annual incentive plan, the committee established a target bonus at 66.7% of base salary for each of the NEOs, with a payout range
of 0%–133% of base salary. Utilizing the same bonus target for all the NEOs promotes a culture of teamwork among the senior executives and encourages
their entrepreneurial spirit. As a result, the CEO’s target 2018 total cash, including both base salary and target annual incentive plan amount, is below the
market 25 th percentile of our compensation peer group.
- 26 -
Table of Contents
The resulting payout range for Mr. Garcia, our chief executive officer, is $0–$530,667, with a target of $266,667. For both Mr. Jenkins, our
chief financial officer, and Mr. Huston, our chief operating officer, the payout range is $0–$497,500, with a target of $250,000. For both Mr. Keeton, our
chief brand officer, and Mr. Gill, our chief product officer, the payout range is $0–$437,800, with a target bonus of $220,000.
PerformanceMetricsandGoals
The performance period for the annual incentive is our fiscal year. The committee selected retail units sold, gross profit per unit ex-Gift, and
EBITDA margin ex-Gift as the performance metrics for our 2018 annual incentive plan because these are the primary metrics we use in evaluating our own
performance when communicating our financial results to our investors.
The committee believes that these performance measures help focus the executives on growing retail units sold and revenue, increasing total
gross profit per unit, and demonstrating operating leverage. The detailed definition of each measure and rationale of selection are provided below:
PERFORMANCE
METRICS USED IN
THE 2018 AIP WEIGHT DEFINITION RATIONALE OF SELECTION
RetailUnitsSold 40% The number of vehicles
sold to customers in a
given period, net of
returns under our
seven-day return policy.
GrossProfitper
Unitex-Gift
40% The gross profit before
compensation expense
related to the 100k
Milestone Gift (as
hereinafter defined) is
included in cost of sales,
divided by retail units sold
in that period.
We view retail units sold as a key measure of our growth for several reasons.
First, retail units sold is the primary driver of our revenues and, indirectly, gross
profit, since retail unit sales enable multiple complementary revenue streams,
including financing, VSCs, GAP waiver coverage, and trade-ins. Second, growth
in retail units sold increases the base of available customers for referrals and
repeat sales. Third, growth in retail units sold is an indicator of our ability to
successfully scale our logistics, fulfillment, and customer service operations.
Total gross profit per unit ex-Gift is driven by sales of used vehicles, each of
which generates additional revenue sources including wholesale sales of vehicles
we acquire from customers as trade-ins, gains on the sales of loans originated to
finance the vehicle, revenue from GAP waiver coverage, and commissions on
sales of VSCs. We believe total gross profit per unit ex-Gift is a key measure of
our growth and long-term profitability.

We believe that EBITDA Margin ex-Gift is an important measure of the leverage
in our business and a useful measure to us and to our investors because it focuses
specifically on operational performance.
At the beginning of 2018, the committee established financial performance goals that were challenging and reflective of Carvana’s fiscal 2018
operating plan, economic and market conditions, and forecasts at the time the performance goals were established. The target performance goal of each
metric is significantly above fiscal 2017’s actual results: over 92,000 retail units sold, a 108% increase over fiscal year 2017’s retail units sold of 44,252;
over $2,100 for gross profit per unit ex-Gift, a $561 increase over fiscal year 2017’s gross profit per unit ex-Gift of $1,539; and EBITDA margin ex-Gift of
less than (7.2)%, a 9.7 percentage point improvement over fiscal year 2017’s EBTIDA margin ex-Gift of (16.9)%.

Based on the committee’s evaluation of our 2018 actual performance against the annual incentive plan goals, 88% of the target annual bonuses
were paid out, amounting to 59% of the NEOs’ respective base salaries. The annual incentive bonus received by each of the NEOs is included in the
“Non-Equity Performance Incentive Plan Compensation” column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement.
Each of the annual incentive metrics provided a payout range of 0%–199% as a percent of the target. For Retail Units Sold, weighted 40% of
the total, the target was over 92,000, and our actual performance was 94,108, resulting in a payout of 118% of the target payout. For gross profit per unit ex-
Gift, weighted 40% of the total, the target was over $2,100 and our actual performance was $2,133, resulting in a payout of 103% of the target. For
EBITDA Margin ex-Gift, weighted 20% of the total, our target was less than (7.2)% and our actual performance was (9.9)%, resulting in no payout.
Aggregating each of the respective payouts, weighted accordingly, resulted in a total payout of 88% of target. Applying the payout of 88% of target to each
of our NEOs respective target bonuses, Mr. Garcia achieved a $235,733 payout amount; Messrs. Jenkins and Huston achieved a payout of $221,000 each,
and Messrs. Keeton and Gill achieved a payout of $194,480 each.
LONG-TERMINCENTIVEPROGRAM
The Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that stock-based performance compensation is essential to align the interests of
Carvana’s management and its shareholders in enhancing the long-term value of our equity and to encourage executives to remain with the company.
Among the varied types of equity awards the committee is authorized to use under the equity plan, stock options are the ones that the committee has
determined are preferable for use with NEOs, because their
- 28 -
Table of Contents
value is more leveraged to future value appreciation and depends upon a future increase in the value of our common stock. The committee also has
determined that restricted stock unit grants to NEOs should be used for the purposes of retention or recognition of outstanding performance in part because
restricted stock units are less volatile than stock options.
2018AnnualGrant
For fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee determined to award an equal blend of time-based stock options and restricted
stock units to provide a mix composed of awards whose value depends upon a future increase in the value of the common stock (time-based stock options)
and awards that serve primarily as a retention tool (time-based restricted stock units).
For the 2018 annual grant, the committee targeted a grant value equal to the amount of each executive’s base salary. The committee initially
targeted the annual grant based on a 10-day average stock price as of April 2, 2018 ($21.61). Based on that price, Mr. Garcia would have received 15,988
options and 9,255 RSUs; Messrs. Jenkins and Huston would have received 14,989 options and 8,677 RSUs; and Messrs. Keeton and Gill would have
received 13,190 options and 7,635 RSUs. However, the grants were not awarded until mid-July when the stock price had more than doubled ($44.21). To
compensate the executives for the disadvantage of receiving stock options with a much higher exercise price, the Committee determined to grant additional
RSUs. The grant value of the additional RSUs is equal to one-half of the in-the-money value difference between the options granted based on the March
stock price and the options granted based on the July stock price, resulting in a total of 13,987 RSUs granted to Mr. Garcia, 13,113 to Messrs. Jenkins and
Huston each, and 11,540 to Messrs. Keeton and Gill each.
2018SpecialPerformance-ContingentGrant
For fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee and the Board also granted a one-time special performance-contingent RSU
award for driving exceptional company performance to achieve an important milestone in the development of the business. The RSUs were granted on
April 30, 2018, to the NEOs other than the CEO; the CEO received his award on May 1, 2018. Mr. Garcia was granted 14,572 RSUs ($393,298 grant
value), Messrs. Jenkins and Huston 13,662 RSUs ($358,081 grant value), and Messrs. Keeton and Gill 12,022 RSUs ($315,097 grant value). All of these
grants will vest 100% on the date of the first periodic report filed where positive quarterly EBITDA is reported. None of the RSUs were vested as of the end
of 2018.
2018100kMilestoneGift
On September 10, 2018, we announced a commitment by our chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III (“Mr. Garcia”), to contribute 165 shares
of Class A common stock to us from his personal shareholdings for every one of our then-existing employees, including the NEOs, upon their satisfying
certain employment tenure requirements. In connection with these contributions, we have made corresponding grants of 165 restricted stock units under our
2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan to each employee who has satisfied the requirements and we intend to make grants to the remaining then-existing employees
as they satisfy the requirements (the “100k Milestone Gift” or “Gift”). Messrs. Jenkins, Huston, Keeton, and Gill all received the grant in 2018, which had a
grant date fair value of $10,562.

Table of Contents
PERQUISITESANDBENEFITS
Currently, we do not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program.
Accordingly, we did not provide perquisites to our executive officers in 2018, including our named executive officers, except that each of the NEOs, along
with certain other employees, can use one of the company inventory vehicles (which generally will be replaced every three years); each, along with many of
our employees, may use a company-provided cellular phone; and each, along with all of our employees, may participate in our 401(k) match benefit which
is based on salary.
We do not expect that any future perquisites or other personal benefits will be a significant aspect of our executive compensation program. All
future practices with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits will be approved and subject to periodic review by the Compensation and Nominating
Committee.
TERMINATION,SEVERANCEANDCHANGEINCONTROLBENEFITS
We do not have employment or severance agreements with our executives.
In the event of a change in control of Carvana Group, all outstanding unvested Class B Unit awards held by participants in the Carvana Group
equity incentive plan, whose employment has not previously terminated, will accelerate in full, subject to certain escrow demand rights held by a purchaser
of control of Carvana Group.
If an executive is terminated involuntarily without cause within twenty-four months following a change in control as defined by our 2018
equity award agreements, all outstanding vested stock options and time-based RSUs of that executive will become fully exercisable or vested. An executive
whose employment is terminated because of death or disability will receive one year from the time of termination to exercise any then-vested options
instead of the usual 90 days, but not past the expiration date of the options. If a person’s employment is terminated for disability, and that person later dies
within a year, the legal representative of the person’s estate may exercise the options within one year of the date of death, though not past the expiration date
of the options.
If a change in control occurs before the performance-contingent RSUs are vested, outstanding shares will vest in a proportionate number based
on the company’s progress toward positive EBITDA, starting from the EBITDA loss baseline as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding
the award (-$41.5 million) to the EBITDA as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date of the closing of the change in control.
Except for these arrangements, none of our named executive officers have entered into any plans, arrangements or agreements with Carvana
providing for payments upon termination of employment or change in control of Carvana, other than payments generally available to all salaried employees
that do not discriminate in scope, terms, or operation in favor of the executive officers of Carvana.

COMPENSATION-RELATED POLICIES
COMPENSATIONRECOVERY(“CLAWBACK”)POLICY
In 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee approved the adoption of a “clawback” policy, which would provide for the clawback
or recoupment of any compensation granted, earned, or vested that is tied to performance metrics, in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from
material noncompliance with certain financial reporting requirements that reveals that such performance (or level of performance) was not achieved.
POLICYREGARDINGHEDGINGANDPLEDGINGOFCOMPANYSTOCK
Carvana’s insider trading policy prohibits all employees from buying or selling Carvana securities while aware of material nonpublic
information and prohibits the disclosure of material nonpublic information to others who then trade in our securities. As part of this policy, certain other
Carvana-securities-related transactions by directors, officers and other employees are also prohibited or subject to specific notice and pre-approval
requirements. The policy is premised on the belief that even in those circumstances where the proposed transaction may not constitute a violation of law or
applicable regulations, it is nonetheless inappropriate for any director, officer, or other employee to engage in short-term or speculative transactions in our
securities which may be viewed as reducing their incentive to improve our performance or inconsistent with the objectives of our stockholders in general.
Therefore, it is our policy that directors, officers, and other employees may not engage in any transactions involving our securities which constitute short
sales, puts, calls, or other similar derivative securities. The policy also prohibits certain other transactions, including hedging or monetization transactions—
e.g., zero-cost collars, forward sale contracts, and arrangements pledging company securities as collateral for a loan (without adequate assurance of other
available assets to satisfy the loan).
COMPENSATION AND RISK
We believe that our compensation programs create appropriate incentives to drive sustained, long-term increases in shareholder value. These
programs have been designed and administered in a manner that discourages undue risk-taking by employees. Relevant features of these programs include:
• Focus on weighting compensation toward four-year and greater vesting schedules of equity awards;
- 31 -
Table of Contents
• individual executive pay generally targeted at median level against comparable executive roles at an appropriate set of peer
companies, except the chief executive officer, for whom we target significantly below median level due to his significant
ownership interest in us;
• robust clawback policies permitting the recoupment of past incentive pay from executive officers in the event of certain kinds of
misconduct, and forfeiture of incentive awards in the event the executive engages in various types of conduct deemed detrimental
to Carvana’s interests, including theft or fraud against Carvana and engaging in competition with Carvana;
• no employment agreements with executive officers;
• the use of retail units sold, gross profit per unit ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift as performance metrics, which incents
employees to increase earnings and manage net assets efficiently;
• restrictions on trading in Carvana Class A common stock to reduce insider trading compliance risk, as well as prohibitions on
pledging and hedging Carvana capital stock.
In light of these features, we conclude that the risks arising from our executive and employee compensation policies and practices are not
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.
TAX AND ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS
Carvana considers the tax and accounting aspects of the elements of compensation we offer in determining the most effective method for
compensating our executives. This includes, but is not limited to, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.
Section 162(m) generally limits the tax deduction available to public companies for annual compensation paid to the chief executive officer and certain
other named executive officers in excess of $1 million.
As a result of 2017 tax legislation, compensation paid in a fiscal year in excess of $1 million to, or on behalf of, an individual who is a “covered
employee” is not expected to be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, unless such compensation qualifies for transition relief
(relating to written binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017, which were not subsequently materially modified). Therefore, certain compensation
paid under our existing equity plans and certain of our long-term equity awards originally designed with the intent that such amounts qualify as
“performance-based” compensation may not be deductible in the future. Although the committee may consider the effect that Section 162(m) and the
potential lack of deduction for amounts paid in excess of the deduction limit may have on Carvana, the committee continues to retain flexibility to make
compensation decisions, in the exercise of its business judgment, that are based on factors that it determines to be appropriate (as determined by the
committee in its sole discretion) to enable Carvana to continue to attract, retain, reward, and motivate its highly-qualified executives. This flexibility may
include amending or modifying the design elements of our historical compensation programs.

(i) Represents discretionary matching contributions under our 401(k) Plan
(ii) The 2016 and 2017 amounts for Mr. Garcia is the incremental cost to Carvana of flights relating to a personal event on the private aircraft operated by
Bridgecrest Credit Company, f/k/a DT Credit Company, LLC (“Bridgecrest”), an affiliate of DriveTime, and leased by Carvana. See “Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions – Relationship with DriveTime – Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement.” The incremental cost to Carvana
of aircraft used under the aircraft time sharing agreement for a non-business flight is calculated by multiplying the aircraft’s per-mile variable
operating cost by a flight’s total mileage, which includes the mileage of an empty return flight. Variable operating costs include: (1) landing, parking,
passenger ground transportation, crew travel, and flight planning services expenses; (2) supplies, catering, and crew traveling expenses; (3) aircraft
fuel and oil expenses; (4) maintenance, parts, and external labor (inspections and repairs); and (5) any customs, foreign permit, and similar fees. Fixed
costs that do not vary based upon usage are not included in the calculation of direct operating cost. On certain occasions, a named executive officer or
a named executive officer’s spouse or other family member may fly on the corporate aircraft as additional passengers. No additional direct operating
cost is incurred in such situations under the foregoing methodology because the costs would not be incremental. Carvana does not pay its named
executive officers any amounts in respect of taxes (so-called gross-up payments) on income imputed to them for non-business aircraft usage.
(iii) The incremental cost of the company car to us has been calculated based on the depreciation value of the vehicle.
(iv) Represents the cost of company-paid cell phone service.
(v) Mr. Garcia’s “All Other Compensation” for 2018 was less than $10,000.

(1) Amounts were determined based on the closing price of Carvana Co.’s Class A common stock on December 31, 2018, of $32.71 and the applicable
participation thresholds of our B1 Units (as defined below), B2 Units (as defined below), B3 Units (as defined below) and B4 Units (as defined
below). These values may not reflect the value actually realized by the named executive officers upon vesting.
(2) These Class B Units (the “B1 Units”) were granted on March 24, 2015, with a participation threshold of $0.00; 200,000 of which vested on July 1,
2015, and 16,667 of which vest on the first of each month beginning on August 1, 2015.

(1) Amounts include restricted stock units and Class B Units. The number of shares and values were determined based on the closing price of Carvana
Co.’s Class A common stock on each vesting date and, in the case of Class B Units, the applicable participation thresholds of our B1 Units, B2 Units,
B3 Units, and B4 Units (all as defined above in the “Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year End” table).
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL
As described in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Termination, Severance, and Change of Control Benefits” above, we do not have an
employment or severance agreement with any of our named executives; however, our NEOs would be entitled to accelerated vesting of certain equity
awards under the following conditions, with values listed as of December 31, 2018:

(1) Amounts in this column represent the market value as of December 31, 2018, on a fully exchanged basis, of the Class B Units, described above under
“Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year End,” that would vest upon a change of control of Carvana Group, as long as the executive’s
employment had not been previously terminated and subject to certain escrow demand rights held by a purchaser of control of Carvana Group. The
performance-contingent RSUs would also vest on a change of control, but in proportion to the progress made toward positive EBITDA. None of the
performance-contingent restricted stock units would be subject to accelerated vesting as of December 31, 2018, because EBITDA as of that date had
not progressed beyond the baseline.
(2) Amounts in this column represent the market value as of December 31, 2018, of all outstanding time-based RSUs, which would become fully vested
if the executive is involuntarily terminated without cause within 24 months of a change of control of Carvana Co. In that event, outstanding unvested
stock options would also become fully vested and exercisable, but as of December 31, 2018, the price of Carvana’s Class A common stock did not
exceed the strike price of those unvested options.
