• an assessment of whether the proposed transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to
employees generally.
The Audit Committee may only approve those transactions that are in or are not inconsistent with our best interests and those of our
stockholders, as the Audit Committee determines in good faith.
AMENDED AND R ESTATED OPERATING AGREEMENT
In connection with the organizational transactions we effected in connection with our IPO, we amended and restated Carvana Group’s existing
operating agreement, which we refer to as the “LLC Operating Agreement.” In addition, on March 2, 2018, Carvana Group signed an amendment of its
LLC Agreement to, among other things, create a class of convertible preferred units. The convertible preferred units were created in connection with the
December 5, 2017, issuance and sale of 100,000 shares of convertible preferred stock of Carvana Co. The amendment was effective December 5, 2017. As
of December 31, 2018, the 100,000 shares of convertible preferred stock had all been converted into shares of Class A common stock and are no longer
outstanding.

Table of Contents
In connection with the issuance of our senior notes (see Carvana’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018, page 66–67), Carvana Group
amended its LLC agreement to create a class of non-convertible preferred units, which Carvana Co. purchased with its net proceeds from the issuance of
these senior notes.
The operations of Carvana Group, and the rights and obligations of the holders of our LLC Units (who we refer to as “LLC Unitholders”), are
set forth in the LLC Operating Agreement.
EXCHANGE AGREEMENT
On April 27, 2017, we entered into an exchange agreement with Carvana Co. Sub LLC (our wholly owned subsidiary) and the LLC
Unitholders. Under the exchange agreement, LLC Unitholders (and certain permitted transferees thereof) may exchange at any time their LLC Units for
either shares of our Class A common stock or for cash, whichever we decide. To the extent LLC Unitholders also hold Class B common stock, they will be
required to deliver to us the same number of shares of Class B common stock as Class A common stock being exchanged for. We will then cancel those
shares of Class B common stock. As LLC Unitholders exchange their interest in Carvana Group, our indirect interest in Carvana Group will increase
correspondingly.
When an LLC Unitholder makes an exchange, they will receive four shares of Class A common stock for every five Class A Units or, at our
option, cash equal to the value of a share of Class A common stock multiplied by 0.8 times the number of Class A Units being exchanged. The value of the
Class A common stock is determined by the average of the volume-weighted average prices for a share of Class A common stock for each of the three
consecutive full trading days ending on and including the last full trading day immediately prior to the related date of exchange. Class B Units are subject to
vesting and a participation threshold, and, as a result, LLC Unitholders exchanging Class B Units will receive a number of shares of Class A common stock
equal to the Class A common stock value (determined the same way as above) less the applicable participation threshold multiplied by 0.8 times the number
of Class B Units being exchanged, divided by the same Class A common stock value, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Exchange Agreement.
REGISTRATION R IGHTS AGREEMENT
In connection with the IPO, we entered into a registration rights agreement with certain LLC unitholders. These LLC unitholders are entitled to
request that we register their shares on a long-form or short-form registration statement on one or more occasions in the future, which registrations may be
“shelf registrations.” All of these LLC unitholders will be entitled to participate in certain of our
- 40 -
Table of Contents
registered offerings, subject to the restrictions in the registration rights agreement. We will pay expenses in connection with the exercise of these rights. The
registration rights described in this paragraph apply to (1) shares of our Class A common stock held by certain LLC unitholders, and (2) any of our capital
stock (or that of our subsidiaries) issued or issuable with respect to the Class A common stock described in clause (1) with respect to any dividend, stock
split, recapitalization, reorganization, or certain other corporate transactions (“Registrable Securities”). These registration rights are also for the benefit of
any subsequent holder of Registrable Securities, provided that any particular securities will cease to be Registrable Securities when they have been sold in a
registered public offering, sold in compliance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act or repurchased by us or our subsidiaries. In addition, any Registrable
Securities held by a person other than an LLC Unitholder and their affiliates will cease to be Registrable Securities if they can be sold without limitation
under Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
TAX REC EIVABLE AGREEMENT
We have entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with LLC Unitholders that will provide for the payment from time to time by us to such
persons of 85% of the amount of the benefits, if any, that we realize or, under certain circumstances, are deemed to realize as a result of
1. the increase in our wholly owned subsidiary’s proportionate share of the existing tax basis of the assets of Carvana Group and an adjustment in
the tax basis of the assets of Carvana Group reflected in that proportionate share as a result of any future exchanges of LLC Units held by an
LLC Unitholder for shares of our Class A common stock or cash, and
2. certain other tax benefits related to our making payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that we actually realize and, except in connection with a change in control, we will not
make any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until after we have directly or indirectly realized (or have been deemed to have realized) benefits
in excess of such payments. These payment obligations are obligations of Carvana Co. and not of Carvana Group. No payments were made during the year
ended December 31, 2018.
INDEMNIFICA TION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS
We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our officers and directors. The indemnification agreements provide the officers
and directors with contractual rights to indemnification, expense advancement, and reimbursement, to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law.
Additionally, we may enter into indemnification agreements with any new directors or officers that may be broader in scope than the specific
indemnification provisions contained in Delaware law.

CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS
On September 10, 2018, we announced a commitment by our chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III, to contribute shares of Carvana Co.
Class A common stock from his personal shareholdings to Carvana at no charge, intended to fund equity awards of 165 restricted stock units (or roughly
$10,000 at the time of the announcement) to each of our then-current employees upon their satisfying certain employment-tenure requirements. During the
year ended December 31, 2018, Carvana and Mr. Garcia entered into contribution agreements pursuant to which Mr. Garcia contributed approximately
0.2 million shares of Carvana Co. Class A common stock to Carvana, at no charge. We subsequently granted approximately 0.2 million restricted stock
units. Although we do not expect Mr. Garcia to incur any tax obligations related to these contributions, we have indemnified Mr. Garcia from any such
obligations that may arise.
RELATIONSHIP WITH DRIVETIME
Prior to November 1, 2014, Carvana, LLC was a wholly owned subsidiary of DriveTime. On November 1, 2014, DriveTime distributed the
units of Carvana, LLC to the unit holders of DriveTime on a pro rata basis, which we refer to as the “Spinoff.” DriveTime is controlled by our controlling
stockholder, Ernest Garcia II, who is also the father of our Chief Executive Officer, Ernest Garcia III. Following the Spinoff, the unitholders of DriveTime
contributed the Carvana, LLC units to Carvana Group.
Subsequent to the Spinoff, we entered into several agreements with DriveTime and affiliated companies that were intended to facilitate our
transition to a standalone company, which are described below, along with subsequent agreements. We will refer to DriveTime and its subsidiaries and
affiliates, other than us, as “DriveTime”. There can be no assurances that DriveTime or its affiliated companies will enter into any new agreements or
arrangements with us, or extend or renew existing agreements or arrangements, on the same terms, similar terms, or at all.
ATLANTA,GAHUBLOCATIONLEASEGUARANTEE
In May 2013, DriveTime guaranteed our obligations under the lease governing our occupancy of the property on which an Atlanta hub is
located. We do not compensate DriveTime for the guarantee. The initial lease term and rent payments commenced December 1, 2013, and the current term
expires on November 30, 2019. Under the lease we may enter into one more two-year extension term. Base rent during the initial term was $9.5 thousand
per month but may increase by 3% of the then-current base rent during each extension term. Monthly rent payments for January 1, 2018, through
November 30, 2018, were $10.4 thousand per month, and as of December 1, 2018, are $10.7 thousand per month through November 30, 2019. In addition to
base rent, we are responsible for our proportionate share of common area maintenance charges.

LEASEAGREEMENT
In connection with the Spinoff, we entered into a lease agreement dated November 1, 2014, with DriveTime that governs our access to and
utilization of space at DriveTime inspection and reconditioning centers (“IRCs”) for vehicle inspection and reconditioning in Blue Mound, Texas, and
Delanco, New Jersey, and previously for inspection and reconditioning in Winder, Georgia. The lease agreement was most recently amended in December
2018. The agreement also governs utilization of office space and parking spaces at various IRCs and retail facilities that we use as hubs.
Under the amended lease agreement, hubs generally have cancellable two-year terms subject to certain two consecutive one-year renewal
options and subject to the terms of any master lease under which we are subleasing. We increased our utilization of the DriveTime IRCs in Blue Mound,
Texas, and Delanco, New Jersey, to 100% as of July 2018. Under the lease agreement, we pay a monthly rental fee related to our pro rata utilization of
space at such facilities plus a pro rata share of each facility’s actual insurance costs and real estate taxes. As it relates to locations where we recondition
vehicles, our share of facility and reconditioning-supplies expenses are calculated monthly by multiplying the actual costs for operating the inspection
centers by an amount related to our pro rata share of total reconditioned vehicles and parking spaces used at such IRCs in a given month. Total expenses
related to this lease agreement were approximately $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
HOUSTON,TXVENDINGMACHINELEASEGUARANTEE

base rent on May 7, 2016. Base rent during the initial term is $23.0 thousand per month, and the initial term expires on April 6, 2026. We have the option to
extend the initial term for four additional consecutive five-year periods. Base rent during each extension term will increase 10% of the then-current base
rent for each subsequent extension.
TEMPE,AZOFFICELEASE
In September 2016, we entered into an agreement to lease the second floor of our corporate headquarters in Tempe, Arizona beginning April
2017. Pursuant to this lease, we paid an initial monthly base rent of $107.0 thousand, which increases throughout the duration of the lease. The lease has an
initial term of 83 months and we have three 5-year extension options. At the request of the landlord, DriveTime agreed to partially guarantee our lease
payments until the 30th full calendar month of the lease. We do not compensate DriveTime for the guarantee.
In connection with this lease, we entered into a sublease with DriveTime for our use of the first floor of the same building. Under the sublease,
which is coterminous with DriveTime’s master lease and has a term of 83 months, subject to our right to exercise three 5-year extension options, we pay
DriveTime rent equal to the amounts due under the master lease, including initial monthly base rent of $102.0 thousand, beginning April 1, 2018, which
increases throughout the duration of the sublease and master lease. Total expenses related to this lease agreement were approximately $0.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018.

In November 2018, Carvana entered into a sublease agreement with DriveTime for an inspection and reconditioning center near Cleveland,
Ohio. Pursuant to the sublease, Carvana temporarily shared space at the IRC until DriveTime vacated the facility in February 2019, at which point we

book value of such improvements and equipment net of accumulated depreciation and amortization) and became the sole occupant. We pay a base rent of
$35.0 thousand per month which increases in each extension term. The sublease has an initial term of three years. We have the ability to exercise three

commission to DriveTime. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized approximately $23.7 million of commissions earned on VSCs sold to
our customers and administered by DriveTime, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. On November 5, 2018 (effective October 1, 2018), we
amended the master dealer agreement to allow Carvana to receive payments for excess reserves based on the performance of the VSCs versus the reserves
held by the VSC administrator, once a required claims period for such VSCs has passed. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Carvana recognized
approximately $1.9 million related to payments for excess reserves to which it expects to be entitled.
Beginning in 2017, DriveTime also administers a portion of our GAP waiver coverage and the limited warranty provided to all customers under

ITEM 2 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee has appointed Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending
December 31, 2019. Services provided to Carvana and its subsidiaries by Grant Thornton LLP for the year ended December 31, 2018 are described below
and under “Audit Committee Report.”
FEES AND SERVICES
The following table summarizes the aggregate fees for professional audit services and other services rendered by Grant Thornton LLP for the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:
SERVICES 2018 2017
Audit Fees $1,524,986(1) $1,061,451(3)
Audit-Related Fees $ — $ —
Tax Fees $ 349,220(2) $ 110,489
All Other Fees $ — $ —
(1) Includes the aggregate fees for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and internal controls, and the reviews of each of our quarterly
consolidated financial statements. These fees also include procedures performed related to our follow-on offering completed in April 2018,
registration of shares on Form S-3 in May and December 2018, and the issuance of our senior notes in September 2018.
(2) Includes the aggregate fees for tax return preparation and other tax compliance services.
(3) Includes $475,782 in fees related to our initial public offering in April 2017 that were reported in “All Other Fees” in our proxy statement prepared in
connection with our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.
In considering the nature of the services provided by the independent auditor, the Audit Committee determined that such services are
compatible with the provision of independent audit services. The Audit Committee discussed these services with the independent auditor and Carvana
management to determine that they are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the SEC to implement
the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy that requires advance approval of all audit services as well as non-audit services to the extent
required by the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002. Unless the specific service has been previously pre-approved with respect to that year,
the Audit Committee must approve the permitted service before the independent auditor is engaged to perform it.
The Audit Committee approved all services provided by Grant Thornton LLP. Representatives of Grant Thornton LLP are expected to be
present at the annual meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and we expect that they will be available to
respond to questions.
- 54 -
Table of Contents
Ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP requires affirmative votes from the holders of a majority of the shares present in person
or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote. If Carvana’s stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, the
Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment and may affirm the appointment or retain another independent accounting firm. Even if the appointment
is ratified, the Audit Committee may in the future replace Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm if it is determined that
it is in Carvana’s best interests to do so.
The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors recommend that you vote “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as
the independent registered public accounting firm of Carvana for the year ending December 31, 2019.

A UDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. The Audit Committee is composed of three independent
directors (as defined by the New York Stock Exchange Listing Standards), met nine times in 2018, and operates under a written charter, which is posted on
our website at investors.carvana.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents. As provided in the charter, the Audit Committee’s oversight
responsibilities include monitoring the integrity of our financial statements (including reviewing financial information, the systems of internal controls, the
audit process, and the independence and performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm) and our compliance
with legal and regulatory requirements. However, management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process,
including our systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee
• reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, with our management;
• discussed with our independent auditors, Grant Thornton LLP, the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (“PCAOB”) Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees); and
• received the written disclosures and the letter from Grant Thornton LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Grant
Thornton LLP’s communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Grant Thornton LLP the
independence of Grant Thornton LLP.
Based on the Audit Committee’s review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the
audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

ITEM 3 – SAY ON PAY
We are asking stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the
“Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” the “Summary Compensation Table,” and the related compensation tables and narrative. This item is being
presented pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although this advisory vote is not binding, the Compensation and Nominating
Committee will consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation program.
Our executive compensation programs are designed to support our long-term success and reflect our pay-for-performance culture. Our company
has grown dramatically over the years. Our growth has few historical precedents and makes us one of the fastest-growing technology, consumer, or retail
companies at our scale, and in 2018 we continued to grow rapidly, with another year of triple-digit unit and revenue growth while simultaneously making
significant progress in gross profit per unit and accelerating our operating leverage. We have a strong belief in promoting a pay-for-performance culture,
and, accordingly, as described in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” of this proxy statement, the Compensation and Nominating Committee has
set challenging performance targets based not on last year’s achievements but continued rapid growth, and has structured our executive compensation
program to tie total compensation to long-term stockholder value, as reflected primarily in our stock price. We believe that our executive compensation
plans effectively support our strategic and financial goals, create a culture of teamwork, and are directly tied to the performance of the company and
shareholder outcomes.
The Board recommends a vote “FOR” approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement.
ITEM 4 – SAY ON PAY FREQUENCY
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking stockholders to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on
executive compensation. Stockholders may specify whether they prefer such votes to occur every year, every two years, or every three years, or they may
abstain. The Board recommends that this vote occur every year.
Although the stockholders’ vote on this proposal is not binding, the Board will consider the voting results in determining the frequency of
future advisory votes. Notwithstanding the Board’s recommendation and the outcome of the stockholder vote, the Board may in the future decide to conduct
advisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on factors such as discussions with stockholders and the adoption of material
changes to compensation programs.
The Board recommends stockholders vote, on an advisory basis, to conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation every “ONE YEAR.”

100K MILESTONE GIFT
ANNEX
On September 10, 2018, we announced a commitment by our chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III, to contribute 165 shares of Class A
common stock to us from his personal shareholdings for every one of our then-existing employees upon their satisfying certain employment tenure
requirements. In connection with these contributions, we have made corresponding grants of 165 restricted stock units under our 2017 Omnibus Incentive
Plan to each employee who has satisfied the requirements and intend to make grants to the remaining then-existing employees as they satisfy the
requirements (the “100k Milestone Gift” or “Gift”). Under U.S. GAAP, the 100k Milestone Gift is treated as compensation expense, a portion of which
relates to the production of our used vehicle inventory and is therefore capitalized to inventory and subsequently recognized within costs of sales when the
related inventory is sold.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we also present the
following non-GAAP measures: gross profit ex-Gift, gross profit per unit ex-Gift, EBITDA ex-Gift, and EBITDA margin ex-Gift. We believe the
presentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our
management team, and it also improves investors’ understanding of our underlying operating performance and their ability to analyze our ongoing operating
trends. All historic non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
GROSSPROFITEX-GIFTANDGROSSPROFITPERUNITEX-GIFT
Gross profit ex-Gift and gross profit per unit ex-Gift are non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and
should not be considered an alternative to gross profit, as determined by GAAP. Gross profit ex-Gift is defined as gross profit before compensation expense
related to the 100k Milestone Gift included in cost of sales. Gross profit per Unit ex-Gift is Gross Profit ex-Gift divided by units sold. We use Gross Profit
ex-Gift to measure the operating performance of our business and Gross Profit per Unit ex-Gift to measure our operating performance relative to our units
sold. We believe that Gross Profit ex-Gift and Gross Profit per Unit ex-Gift are useful measures to us and to our investors because they exclude the expense
associated with the 100k Milestone Gift recognized in cost of sales. We expect the 100k Milestone Gift to be a one-time award program for which we will
recognize varying amounts of expense beginning in the second half of 2018 and continuing through the first half of 2020, and therefore we believe the
related expense does not reflect our core operations, is not included in our past operations, and may not be indicative of our future operations. Additionally,
the shares issued to settle the 100k Milestone Gift are offset by share contributions from Mr. Garcia to Carvana, therefore we expect the impact on shares
outstanding to be nearly zero. We believe that excluding it enables us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our
competitors.

EBITDA ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift are non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and
should not be considered an alternative to net loss or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. EBITDA ex-Gift is defined as net loss before
interest expense,

income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and the compensation expense related to the 100k Milestone Gift. EBITDA margin ex-Gift is
EBITDA ex-Gift as a percentage of total revenues. We use EBITDA ex-Gift to measure the operating performance of our business and EBITDA Margin
ex-Gift to measure our operating performance relative to our total revenues. We believe that EBITDA ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift are useful
measures to us and to our investors because they exclude certain financial and capital structure items and the expense associated with the 100k Milestone
Gift that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring operations, in part because they may vary widely
across time and within our industry independent of the performance of our core operations. In particular, we expect the 100k Milestone Gift to be a
one-time award program for which we will recognize varying amounts of expense beginning in the second half of 2018 and continuing through the first half
of 2020, and therefore we believe the related expense does not reflect our core operations, is not included in our past operations, and may not be indicative
of our future operations. Additionally, the shares issued to settle the 100k Milestone Gift are offset by share contributions from Mr. Garcia to Carvana;
therefore, we expect the impact on shares outstanding to be nearly zero. We believe that excluding these items enables us to more effectively evaluate our
performance period-over-period and relative to our competitors. EBITDA ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures provided by other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculations. A reconciliation of EBITDA ex-Gift to net loss which
includes 100k Milestone Gift expense and is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and calculation of EBITDA margin ex-Gift is as follows (dollars
in thousands):
