fraudster named Arnold Prosperi, whose own prison sentence
had been commuted by Bill Clinton on the day before Clinton
left office.

Sheriff Bradshaw wants to be clear: none of these visits was
conjugal.

But even US attorney Acosta, who negotiated Epstein’s unusual
agreement with the government, would say that Epstein’s arrange-
ment was highly irregular.

“Epstein appears to have received highly unusual treatment
while in jail,” Acosta would say in a letter addressed to the gen-
eral public. “Although the terms of confinement in a state prison
are a matter appropriately left to the state of Florida and not fed-
eral authorities, without doubt, the treatment that he received
while in state custody undermined the purpose of a jail sentence.”

And, of course, Epstein’s stay at the Stockade was subsidized
by taxpayers.
