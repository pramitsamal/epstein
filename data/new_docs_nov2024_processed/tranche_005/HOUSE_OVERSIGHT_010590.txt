Edwards that Brunel might have been procuring two eight-year-old girls for Epstein to sexually
abuse. According to widely circulated press reports reviewed by Edwards, Brunel is in his
sixties and has a reputation throughout the world (and especially in the modeling industry) as a
cocaine addict that has for years molested children through modeling agencies while acting as
their agent — conduct that has been the subject of critical reports, books, several news articles,
and a 60 Minutes documentary on Brunel’s sexual exploitation of underage models. See
hitp://bradmillershero. blogspot.com/2010/08/women-are-objects.html, attached hereto as Exhibit
“FR.”

63. Edwards learned that Brunel is also someone that visited Epstein on
approximately 67 occasions while Epstein was in jail. See Epstein's jail visitor log attached as
Exhibit “GG.”

64. | Edwards learned that Brunel currently runs the modeling agency MC2, a company
for which Epstein provides financial support. See Message Pad's attached as Exhibit “J” supra
and Sworn Statement of MC2 employee Maritza Vasquez, June 15, 2010, “Maritza Vasquez
Sworn Statement” attached at Exhibit “HH” at 1-16.

65. Employees of MC2 told Edwards that Epstein’s numerous condos at 301 East 66
Street in New York were used to house young models. Edwards was told that MC2 modeling
agency, affiliated with Epstein and Brunel brought underage girls from all over the world,
promising them modeling contracts. Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a visa for these girls,
then would charge the underage girls rent, presumably to live as underage prostitutes in the
condos. See Maritza Vasquez Sworn Statement, Exhibit “HH” at 7-10, 12-15, 29-30, 39-41, 59-

60 and 62-67.
