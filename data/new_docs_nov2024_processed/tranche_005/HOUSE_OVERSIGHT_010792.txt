(Recess was held from 9:49 a.m. until 10:01 a.m.)
VIDEOGRAPHER: Going back on the record.

The time is approximately 10:01 a.m.

MR. SCOTT: If you've finished your bagel,
we're ready to proceed, J think,

MR. SCAROLA: I think we are. I was
actually ready to proceed a little bit earlier,

but we'll proceed now.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Mr. Dershowitz, do you agree with the
basic concept that one is presumed to be innocent
until proven guilty?

A. Yes.

Q. Has Virginia Roberts ever been proven to
be guilty of any crime at any time, anywhere, at any
age?

A. I don't know the answer to that question,
but I do know that she was brought into the legal
system for stealing money from her employer and |
think it's fair to characterize that as her having a
criminal record, yeah.

Q. Te the extent that anyone might interpret
your comment that Virginia Roberts was ever
convicted of a crime, they would be drawing a false
conclusion as far as you know, correct?

A. As far as } know, I don’t know of her
having convicted of any crime. But I do know that

she was proceeded against for having stolen money.
And | don't think she contested that. I don’t think
there's any dispute about the fact that she stole

money and engaged in other crimes as well.

Q. When did you find out about this alleged
crime?

A. As soon as the false allegation against me
was made public, | got call after call after call
from people telling me about Virginia Roberts, about
your 22 clients. The calls just kept coming in
because there was such outrage at this false
allegation being directed against me.

MR. SCAROLA: Move to strike the
unresponsive portion of the answer.
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. You found out as soon as the CVRA
complaint was -- the CVRA allegations referencing
you were filed; is that correct?

A. I didn't say that. I said as soon as they
were made public and as soon as the newspapers
carried these false stories, I recetved phone calls
and I leamed about -- | learned about her encounter
with the criminal justice system.

Q. That would certainly have been prior to
February 23rd of 2015, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. SCOTT: Are you going back to the
exhibit now with the newspapers and --
MR. SCAROLA: Not yet.
MR. SCOTT: Okay.
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Having reviewed the available airplane
flight logs, you are aware that Bill Clinton flew on
at least 15 occasions with Jeffrey Epstein on his
private plane, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you ever attempted to get flight log
information with regard to Former President
Clinton's other private airplane travel?

A. No.

Q. Never made a public records request —-

A. Yes.

Q. -- under the Freedom of Information Act
with regard to those records?

A. Well, we have made a Freedom of
Information request. My -- my attorney in New York,
Louis Freeh, the former head of the FBI, has made a
FOIA request for all information that would

216

conclusively prove that Bill Clinton was never on
Jeffrey Epstein’s island, yes.

Q. And you were denied those records,
correct?

A. No, no, no.

Q. Oh, you got them?

MR. SCOTT: Well, wait a minute. Let's
take it slow. Ask a question.

A. Asany lawyer knows, FOIA requests take a
long, long period of time. So they were neither
denied nor were they given to us. They are very
much in process.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. When was --

A. While we're talking about -- may I
complete -- | want to amend one answer | gave
previously.

While we're talking about the plane logs,
] must say that during the recess, my wife Googled
Tatiana and found out that she was, in fact, 24
years old in 1995, at the time she flew on that
airplane. So that my characterization of her as
about 25 years old is absolutely correct.

And the implication that you sought to
draw by showing me those pictures was not only
