Certainly he knew they were there?

T don't know, sir.

That's the best you can do? That's really

the best you can do? You think a professional
lawyer would make these allegations based on I
don't know, sir.

MR. SCAROLA: Is there a question pending,
Mr. Scott?

MR. SCOTT: He's reading -- you asked him
what he was reading --

MR. SCAROLA: Yes, sir.

MR. SCOTT: -- from and I had him publish
it.

MR. SCAROLA: Yeah, I know, and then he
went on to make a speech. So I know I don't
have to do it, but I'm compelled to move to
strike the unresponsive speeches.

MR. SCOTT: And I consider these to be a
response to the interrogation that you did
taking excerpts improperly and not having the
entire record in front of him, which he's
entitled to do to make that the record is
complete. And | intend to protect him in that
way.

A. Let me answer. Rely connotes to me that
they would place a heavy emphasis on that to the
exclusion of other things and that it would be
enough. And so my answer is, yes, they certainly
should have read all the reports. They certainly
should have read all the transcripts. But they also
should have called me, they should have made other
inquiry, and they should have made sure that they
read all of these depositions and reports in
context.

And if you're implying that there are FBI
reports that in any way inculpate me, that's
inconsistent with the information I have from Former
Chief of Assistant Jeffrey Sloman, who was prepared
to file an affidavit saying that that wasn't the
case but was prevented from doing so by the Justice
Department.

MR. SCOTT: It's about noon now. So I

guess we're heading -- we're wrapping this up?

MR. SCAROLA: Not quite yet.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. You do agree that the allegations that
Virginia Roberts made against Prince Andrew were
well-founded allegations, correct?

A. Ihave absolutely no idea. I've met

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. So we have agreed that it was reasonable
for Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell, in assessing
the credibility of Virginia Roberts, to rely upon
police reports, FBI reports, U.S. Attorney's Office
information, and information from the Palin Beach
County State Attorney's Office, correct?

A. No.

Q. No?

A. No. It would not be enough for them to do
that --

Q. I didn't ask you whether it was enough.

A. You said it was --

Q. Lasked you: Would it reasonable for them
to rely upon those sources of information in
assessing the credibility of Virginia Roberts?

A. Not alone, not without looking at --

Q. That wasn't ny question.

A. -- other sources of information.

MR. SCOTT: Wait a minute.
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Well, what he's relying upon --

MR. SCOTT: You're not the judge here.

Let him -- ask a question and let him answer it

and not cut him off, please.

Prince Andrew on a number of occasions in a public
context. He came and spoke in my class at Harvard
law school. The dean then had a dinner in his -- or
lunch in his honor. I was then invited to a dinner

at the British Consulate.

I've never seen him in the presence of any
underaged women, so I have absolutely no basis for
reaching any conclusion whatsoever about
Prince Andrew.

Q. So you don’t know one way or another
whether those allegations are true or false?

A. Neither do you. Nobody would know except
two people, I imagine. But I don't know. Of course

. All right.

A. But I presume --

. You say you have never seen him ~-

A. -- people innocent --

Q. -in the presence of any underaged women,
but you've seen photographs of him in the presence
of an underaged woman, correct?

A. Thave, yes.

MR. SCAROLA: May we mark this as the next
numbered exhibit, please.

A. And I want to note --
