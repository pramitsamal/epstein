there. So I mentioned the Palm Beach Police Department

report.

The next thing that I want to mention is the
Jane Doe 102 complaint. In August of 2009, Bob
Josefsberg -~ who is, from what I understood, a very
well-regarded lawyer here in Florida; in fact, a lawyer
that was selected by the United States Government to
represent a number of the -- of the girls that had been
sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. He was -- he was
part of the procedure that was including the
nonprosecution agreement.

In August of 2009, he filed a complaint on
behalf of Virginia Roberts. That complaint indicated
that Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in
Florida, in New York, and in -- in other places, as I
recall. The thing that -- that I particularly recall
was that Mr. Josefsberg had said, Virginia Roberts was
abused by -- and he gave some categories of people.

He mentioned, I think, business people. He
mentioned royalty, and he mentioned academicians. And
so to tie into your question, I knew that Professor
Dershowitz was an academician. And so what I was seeing
now was, that according to a very, very respected
attorney here in Florida, he had found Virginia Roberts
to be credible, and had filed a lawsuit against

Mr. Epstein saying that she had been trafficked,
sexually trafficked, you know, not just abused by
Mr. Epstein, but now being forcibly sent to, you know,
other people to abuse.

And in the categories of people that were
sexually abusing her were academicians, and I knew that
Mr. Dershowitz fell within that category of -- of being

an academician. The -~ that complaint also indicated
that there might be flight logs that would show that
Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in these

various locations. And that started to indicate to me
that there might be what the law refers to as a common

scheme or plan. And that, just as Virginia Roberts was

being trafficked to these powerful people in various

places, there might well be other girts.

And so I have mentioned a flight log, and let

you -~ you wanted to talk about Mr. Dershowitz. On --

on December 30th, 2009, I was aware that there was a

flight log showing Mr. Dershowitz flying with Tatiana,

who as far as I can tell was not a business person, was

not providing financial advice or something else.

I understood that Mr. Epstein was a

billionaire who was heavily involved in financial

issues. I knew that Tatiana was on a plane with

Mr, Dershowitz, and then there was also, if I recall

correctly, working from memory as -~ as you were
wondering about, there was a notation that
Mr, Dershowitz was on a plane with one female.

And so I was -~ when I looked at that, I'm
seeing Mr. Dershowitz on a -- on a flight with a woman
who doesn't seem to be there for, frankly anything other
than sexual purposes or something along those lines with
Mr. Epstein, with Mr, Epstein, who is a sex trafficker,
and with one female which seemed to me to be a potential
entry for disguising international sex trafficking. So
that was of concern.

I then began to look at, well, I wonder, how
would I find out if Mr. Dershowitz had been abusing
other girls? Let's see. I knew that Virginia Roberts
had been forced to -~ to -- to -- to do this sort of
thing.

MS. McCAWLEY: You're okay as long as

you're -~ if you're revealing something that's in
an affidavit --

THE WITNESS: That's right.

MS. McCAWLEY: -- that she submitted, you're

fine.

THE WITNESS: Right. So -- so what...

Let's see. What did I want, at this point --
