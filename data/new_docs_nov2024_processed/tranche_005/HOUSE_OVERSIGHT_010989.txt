Basic Glossary

I use standard terms when I can find them, and coin new ones like “aims” and “ends”

when I can’t. But even standard ones are ambiguous. The vocabulary of economics is

not settled. Look up “capital” or “output” or “cash flow”, for example, in any

economic dictionary. It will show ranges of meanings, and appreciably different

ones from one dictionary to the next. I coped by defining as | went along, and would

have had to do the same even if this book were meant for economists only.

Otherwise the ambiguities would have left loopholes.

Definitions include:

Capital:

Cash flow:

Ends:
Exhaust:
Flow:

Human capital:
