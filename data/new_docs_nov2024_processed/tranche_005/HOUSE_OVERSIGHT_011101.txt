house they would have bought. They will not have missed a sure-fire investment.
The crash of 2008 showed that houses are risky too. The time to commit to huge and
illiquid investments, as houses are, is after ten or fifteen years of business

experience.

I see no reason why lending banks should not make equity investments too. Loans,
convertible loans and equity investments need the same “due diligence”, or research
into prospects of success and return. All might serve the same clients. “Lending
banks” might simply be investment banks. That’s why splitting of investment banks
and commercial (deposit-and-lend) banks may be a step in the wrong direction. The

key is splitting off deposits.

Macroeconomics in General

Splitting up commercial banks into omnibus funds and depositless lending banks
could change the nature of macroeconomics. Macro has meant the art of maintaining
growth and money value stability at the same time. This has proved mostly a
tightrope walk between inflation and recession. Easy money risks the first, and tight
money the second. My idea is to disconnect the problems of underemployment and
money value instability. If medicine for one has no side effect on the other, each can

be treated more freely.

I would first dissociate money value from money supply. No supply is too large if
money earns competitive returns while we hold it. That was one of the main ideas of
the omnibus fund. Milton Friedman thought my early version of this idea was
anathema. Franco Modigliani liked it fine, but asked tough questions. I'll try to

answer some of them below.

My approach to the problems of underemployment and the business cycle begins

with phasing out deposit-and-lend banks as | described. | more or less agree with
