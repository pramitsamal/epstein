even in 2008 and the flash crash of 2013. Short legs have been protected without fail,
and long legs have got what they bargained for. The reason is that margin

sufficiency is monitored from tick to tick. Checking every few seconds doesn’t rule
out every doomsday scenario, but gives about as much confidence as we're going to

find in this uncertain world.

Saltwater and freshwater schools debate the wisdom of fiscal and monetary policy.
But both sides frame their arguments in Keynesian language. | find it wanting. The
idea that intended consumption is either invested or not, and realized in equal
capital growth if it is, misses the essential mechanics. It measures employment of
plant and people in hours rather than in production. This is a good reason why
macro should start again from scratch. Another is to recast its basis equations in
terms of market-valued capital as well as flows. Another is to accommodate human
capital, for example by substituting the pay and Y rules for the doctrines that pay

measures work and that output is investment plus consumption.

None of those good reasons refers to the possibility of omnibus funds. They are only
a gleam in my eye. If they come to pass, and succeed as | imagine, macro will have
still more novelty to digest. If they lead to devolution into separate deposit and
lending banks, with the deposit banks operating as omnibus funds, good riddance to
the 10:1 leverage that has brought down economies every generation or so since

Marco Polo’s time.

The lagged flow method of assessing efficacy of ex ante investment is outdated by
the simultaneous rates one outlined in Chapter 4. It should go to honorable
retirement whenever market-valued capital is available. It superimposes the
inevitable unintended lag of accounts themselves, even under best practices, onto
the intended one needed for the new tree planted to bear fruit. Both lags blur

causality.
