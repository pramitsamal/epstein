simplifies to gift. Transfer in gained by the owner’s total capital, net of the same

internal transfers, is gift received. The math becomes
T=¥, Y=¥y,-y¥, &-F =7,+¢, , F=y_ and F=y+C, (A1.5)

at the scale of each individual's total capital as a whole. Here y (gamma) is net gift,

y, isgiftand y_ is gift received.
Divide (A1.1) by K, to find

K, F
=—14—, (A1.6)
K,

oS:
K, K,

Define these three terms as productivity or rate of return r, total capital growth rate

g and cash flow rate f. Then (A1.6) can be reexpressed as
r=gtf. (A1.6a)
(A1.3) combines with (A1.6) to show
K. C

T

Y Ay, , at the collective scale. (A1.7)
K, K,. K,

Define “pure consumption rate” C, as C, /K,,, and substitute to show

r=gtc,, at the collective scale. (A1.7a)
