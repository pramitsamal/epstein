any questions we wanted to ask him about Epstein or Maxwell he

re hand-tied

says he's got an attorney/client privilege. So w

because we can't ask about the issues that we need to ask about

with respect to that witness. So in my view, it's highly

prejudicial to have him as a witness at trial when, again, our

claims are not against him, and we have those issues.

Now, you did have -- in your February 2nd order, you

also precluded us from asking questions that we contended wer

non-Fifth Amendment questions of Jeffrey Epstein about
Dershowitz, holding that those were not relevant. So we're in
a Situation where we have another witness that we are not able

to elicit all of the information we need to be able to prove

the truth or falsity of that, and again, it would be subject to

a number of mini trials on that issue of Mr. Dershowitz.

So with respect to those thr categories and it

also allows them to use the attorney/client privilege as a

sword and a shield in the midst of a trial, which is inherently
unfair to my client, as well.
So in our view, it's highly prejudicial under 403.

Those groupings should not come in. It should not be about,

for example, Clinton and whether or not he was on an island, or

Mr. Dershowitz or these other world leaders, it should be about

the defendant and her statements that my client was lying when

she claimed to be abused and trafficked in those statements.
