ACTUATORS

Fig. 6.4: Links Between Cognitive Processes and the Atomspace. The cognitive pro-
cesses depicted all act on the Atomspace, in the sense that they operate by observing certain

Atoms in the Atomspace and then modifying (or in rare cases deleting) the

m, and potentially

adding new Atoms as well. Atoms represent all forms of knowledge, but some forms of knowl-
edge are additionally represented by external data stores connected to the Atomspace, such as
the Procedure Repository; these are also shown as linked to the Atomspace.
