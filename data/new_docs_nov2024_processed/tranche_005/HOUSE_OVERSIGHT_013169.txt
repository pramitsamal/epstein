13.3 Atoms: Their Types and Weights 253

of pure functional programming formalisms like combinatory logic. However, this purely func-
tional style has not proved convenient, so the Atomspace in practice combines functional-style
representation with variable-based representation.

Temporal links often come with specific temporal quantification, e.g.
PredictivelImplicationLink <5 seconds>

EvaluationLink JumpOffCliff $x
EvaluationLink Dead $X

indicating that the conclusion will generally follow the premise within 5 seconds. There is a
system for managing fuzzy time intervals and their interrelationships, based on a fuzzy version
of Allen Interval Algebra.

SequentialANDLink is similar to PredictiveImplicationLink but its truth value is calculated
differently. The truth value of

SequentialANDLink <5 seconds>
EvaluationLink JumpOffCliff $x
EvaluationLink Dead $X

indicates the likelihood of the sequence of events occurring in that order, with gap lying within
the specified time interval. The truth value of the PredictivelmplicationLink version indicates
the likelihood of the second event, conditional on the occurrence of the first event (within the
given time interval restriction).

There are also links representing basic temporal relationships, such as BeforeLink and Af
terLink. These are used to refer to specific events, e.g. if X refers to the event of Ben waking
up on July 15 2012, and Y refers to the event of Ben getting out of bed on July 15 2012, then
one might have

AfterLink X ¥
And there are TimeNodes (representing time-stamps such as temporal moments or intervals)
and AtTimeLinks, so we may e.g. say

AtTimeLink
xX
TimeNode: 8:24AM Eastern Standard Time, July 15 2012 AD

13.3.8 Associative Links

There are links representing associative, attentional relationships,

HebbianLink
AsymmetricHebbianLink
InverseHebbianLink
SymmetricInverseHebbianLink

These connote associations between their arguments, i.e. they connote that the entities repre-
sented by the two argument occurred in the same situation or context, for instance

HebbianLink happy smiling
AsymmetricHebbianLink dead rotten
InverseHebbianLink dead breathing
