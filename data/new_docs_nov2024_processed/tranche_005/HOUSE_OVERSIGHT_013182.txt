Fig. 13.1: A Simplified Look at Feedback-Control in Uncertain Inference

What is missing in [PNRO7] and [Dam00] perspective is a vision of distributed memories
as attractors. The idea of localized memories serving as indices into distributed knowledge
stores is important, but is only half the picture of glocal memory: the creative, constructive,
dynamical-attractor aspect of the distributed representation is the other half. The closest thing
to a clear depiction of this aspect of glocal memory that seems to exist in the neuroscience
literature is a portion of William Calvin’s theory of the “cerebral code” [Cal96]. Calvin pro-
poses a set of quite specific mechanisms by which knowledge may be represented in the brain
using complexly-structured strange attractors, and by which these strange attractors may be
propagated throughout the brain. Figure 13.2 shows one aspect of his theory: how a distributed
attractor may propagate from one part of the brain to another in pieces, with one portion of
the attractor getting propagated first, and then seeding the formation in the destination brain
region of a close approximation of the whole attractor.

Calvin’s theory may be considered a genuinely glocal theory of memory. However, it also
makes a large number of other specific commitments that are not part of the notion of glo-
cality, such as his proposal of hexagonal meta-columns in the cortex, and his commitment to
evolutionary learning as the primary driver of neural knowledge creation. We find these other
