density, kindling temperature and desperation-induced willing of faith, sweep
through the entire woods in a sudden blaze. This is the spirit of percolation.
Computer simulations of percolating blazes generate a multiplicity of life times of
forest fires near the singularity that represents the transition to a global
conflagration.

Mentioned previously is Rudolf Otto’s 1917 book about the characteristics of
religious experience, Das Heilige, The Sacred, which described phases in the
discontinuous transition from everyday life to the wholly other (ganz andere) reality

of the world of the sacred. They include intense

book, Patterns in Comparative Religions, this well-known historian of religion called

the revelatory occurrence of sacred reality an hierophany. Eliade’s classic work,
The Sacred and the Profane, contrasts the homogenous, spiritually formless and
relative world of the profane with the results of passage through spatial and
temporal singularities to a place and time that are not of this world.

Poincaré said that the brain did not know of absolute space, but rather
established a model of it through internal reconstructions of sequential sensory

problems that lacked analytic solutions. In this way, simple algebraic operations
replace some of the insoluble problems of the calculus. Eliade’s sacred space

point that is no longer a circle, can be viewed also as Poincaré’s topological center.

called groups defines this kind of algebraic, mathematical structure and motion.
