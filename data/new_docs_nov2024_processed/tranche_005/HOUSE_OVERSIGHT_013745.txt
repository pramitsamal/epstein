role of self-intersection on manifolds in this new source of irreversibility (with a

resulting “arrow of time”) is developed in Mackey (1992).

As noted, the skeleton which configures attractors is composed of unstable,
“saddle” fixed points, each of which attract (iron down) the trajectory along one
dimension and repel or spread it out along another. Systems fulfilling the criteria for
a chaotic dynamical system have the property of a countably infinite number of
unstable periodic orbits composed of these unstable fixed points. Depending upon
parameters, the orbital points can pull up their tails to be discrete with respect to
each other or spread along the unstable direction to connect smoothly with others
along a curve such as a saddle cycle. Parametric control of the strengths and
structures of the saddle point skeleton of typical attractors can be used to change
both the rate of generation of novel symbols as well as recurrances to old ones in
the symbolic dynamics generating a brain dynamical system’s lexagraphic products
(Bowen, 1978; Alexeev and Jacobson, 1981)).

Using a variety of techniques to algorithmically register “return times,”
experimental condition-sensitive “saddle orbits” composing unstable periodic orbits
have been demonstrated in geometric reconstructions of real data series generated
by a 40+ component chemical reaction (Lathrop and Kostelich, 1989), in response
to natural stimuli in the time dependent behavior of the crayfish caudal
photoreceptor (Pei and Moss, 1996) and in the interburst interval sequences
recorded in hippocampal slices of the rat (So et al, 1997; So et al, 1998). If the
reader uses the software listed above to simulate the time evolution of one of these
attractors of abstract or real systems , she will learn that a remarkably small number
of points, a very short time sample, will outline, “shadow” (Bowen, 1978), the
complete array of unstable fixed points before filling in the attractor. It is tempting to
speculate about the potential nervous system relevance of this dynamical
anticipation of the attractor’s recognizable geometry, as well as a precis of what the
symbolic dynamics are going to say occurs many time steps before filling in the

attractor and its asymptotic message. Values of the measures made on the early

unstable periodic orbit arrays such ht, hu and 4(+), resemble very closely those
