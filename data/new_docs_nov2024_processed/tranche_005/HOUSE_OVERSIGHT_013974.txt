= Otalo ( www.otalo.com )

Otalo is a search engine for vacation rentals that searches across the Internet’s many different vacation
rentals sites and 200,000+ homes. Otalo is like a Kayak.com for vacation rentals. The site scours a
variety of other rental search sites and aggregates the results in one easy-to-use search tool.

> Hostels.com ( www.hostels.com )

This site isn’t just for youth hostels. I found a nice hotel in downtown Tokyo for $20 per night and have
used this site for similar housing in eight countries. Think location and reviews (see HotelChatter next)
instead of amenities. Four-star hotels are for binge travelers; this site can offer a real local flavor before
you find an apartment or other longer-term housing.

= HotelChatter ( www.hotelchatter.com )

Get the real scoop on this daily web journal with detailed and honest reviews of housing worldwide.
Updated several times daily, this site offers the stories of frustrated guests and those who have found
hidden gems. Online booking is available.
