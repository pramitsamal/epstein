+1.0% after 3 months and +3.7% after 6 months. Subsequent returns were positive in
six of the eleven episodes and negative in the other five. Those stats are a little worse
than the comparable numbers for the full sample but don’t indicate that a bond yield
spike is definitively negative for equities.

It matters why yields are rising — higher inflation breakevens key for stocks.
Digging a little deeper shows that the underlying dynamics in the bond market matter.
Essentially rising inflation breakevens is the key driver for equities. Even when real
yields are rising it is the change in implied inflation that has correlated most strongly
with equity returns in recent years. Looking at 4-week rolling returns since 2009, in the
periods that real yields rose Stoxx 600 returns were a median +1.7% if breakevens were
also higher at the same time. In contrast a combination of higher real yields and lower
inflation breakevens led to a median -0.7% return.
