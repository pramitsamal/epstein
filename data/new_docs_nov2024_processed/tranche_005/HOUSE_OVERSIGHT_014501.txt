Police say woman tried to smuggle pot into prison

By BRIAN O’CONNOR
Daily News Staff

A Mon Bijou woman tried to sneak
two bags of marijuana into Golden
Grove, police said.

Sherifa Petersen, 27, faces a single
charge of introducing contraband
into prison, and was free on $10,000
bail about six hours later, according
to her arrest record.

VI. police arrested Petersen on
Friday afternoon about 1:47 p.m.,
after corrections officers discovered

the marijuana hidden in the personal
belongings of inmate Omari Gordon,
according to Petersen’s arrest log.

Rick Mullgrav, Director of the Bu-
reau of Corrections, said corrections
officers discovered the marijuana
during a routine search.

Petersen “was bringing a pack-
age for her companion, and I will
say her companion, because I’m not
sure what the relationship was there,”
Mullgrav said. “She was coming to
visit, and she brought some drugs.”

Corrections officers told police

they had smelled marijuana in a pair
of black Jordan sneakers Petersen
was bringing to Gordon, according to
a VIPD press release. When correc-
tions officers pulled apart the sneak-
ers, they discovered two small plastic
bags of marijuana, according to the
press release.

Any material that ends up in the
hands of prisoners is thoroughly
searched as a matter of routine, Mull-
grav said.

“We search any item that goes to
the inmates,” he said. “Generally

speaking, it’s pretty thorough.”

Gordon, 32, has been in jail
since police charged him with first-
degree attempted murder and first-
degree assault following a Nov. 29
shooting on St. Croix, authorities
have said.

Gordon’s name also matches that
of a man charged in 2010 with the
murder of 19-year-old Kendal Wood.
Gordon’s trial languished in the Su-
perior Court on St. Croix for almost
three years, and he was most recently
granted a continuance in 2013.

The disposition of the murder
case involving Gordon couldn’t be
immediately ascertained Monday
evening.

Gordon had been released on elec-
tronic monitoring and house arrest
pending trial in 2013, according to
court documents at the time.

He was being held on $500,000
bail in his most recent arrest, police
said.

Federal judges from Philadelphia in the Virgin Islands to hear cases

By BRIAN O’CONNOR
Daily News Staff

The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Ap-
peals will sit this week in the federal
courthouse on St. Thomas.

Judges Kent Jordan, Michael Cha-
gares and Thomas Hardiman will hear
a range of appellate cases, ranging
from a local prisoner challenging his
detention as unconstitutional to an es-

tate battle over an inheritance in which
two separate federal cases were merged
into one.

The judges fly in from Philadelphia
to hear argument on issues they decide
at a later date.

Appellate court argument is based
around rapid-fire questions from the
empaneled judges, unlike civil or
criminal court, which frequently is
dominated by long exchanges between

attorneys and witnesses.

The appellant attorney gets four min-
utes to make a case, followed by four
minutes from the appellee, followed by
four minutes of rebuttal from the appel-
lant attorney, though judges’ questions
can sometimes turn four minutes into
eight.

For example, Ronald Gillette, incar-
cerated in 2008 on multiple counts of
aggravated rape and unlawful sexual

contact against two children, is seeking
an appeal on a motion denying his re-
lease from custody.

Gillette’s attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo
III, began on Monday by making his
case that the motion, ordered by Chief
District Court Judge Wilma Lewis,
constituted a final judgement and thus
was worthy of an appeal. DiRuzzo
sought a three-judge panel to overturn
Lewis's order.

It didn’t take long for Jordan to ask
a question.

“How can it be a final order if there
are still claims in the case, if you’re still
seeking relief, which you are?” he said.

DiRuzzo had a response.

“The denial of a three-judge panel
effectively throws Mr. Gillette out of
court,” he said. He started to add to this,
but Jordan cut him off.

“There are claims for relief, they still
exist,” he said. “I’m struggling to see
how this is a final judgement.”

Orders relating to the change in
the reduction of a prison population
essentially rely on three-judge pan-
els to be valid, DiRuzzo said. Pris-
on orders issued by a single judge
are subject to challenge on appeal,
DiRuzzo said.

“IT would submit that three-judge
courts are desirable in confrontations
between state and federal power,” he
said.

Kimberly Salisbury was the Assis-
tant Attorney General arguing for the
appellee. Her job on Monday was to
tell three federal judges that it wasn’t
their job to decide Gillette’s case.

“This particular order is just simply
not final,” she said, at one point.

However, Hardiman had a question.

If there was an order short of Gil-
lette’s release that could make the
prison resolve the Eighth Amendment
violations that put the prison under a
federal consent decree for decades to
resolve, Lewis or another judge could
still make the determination. The pris-
on has completed only 14 percent of
the new consent decree ordered in 2013
according to testimony.

“What would that order look like?”
Hardiman asked.

Salisbury struggled with an answer.

Jordan tried to steer the argument
back to the facts of the case.

“Does the fact that a 2013 consent
decree superseded and replaced the
original, does it mean the three decades
of prior noncompliance is to be ig-
nored?” he said. “You're not even a fifth
of the way completed. At what point is
enough enough?”

Complying with the consent decree
will take time, Salisbury said.

“According to the Bureau of Correc-
tions, we're not there yet,” she said.

Chagares jumped in, and compared
Golden Grove Adult Correctional Fa-
cility to a luxury cruise liner.

“Tt’s like your big cruise ships out in
the bay,” he said. “It takes a long time
to turn around. But this is a really long
time.”

Hearings will continue today before
the Third Circuit at the DeLugo Federal
Building on St. Thomas at 9 a.m. An-
other session is set for Thursday start-
ing at 10:30 a.m.
