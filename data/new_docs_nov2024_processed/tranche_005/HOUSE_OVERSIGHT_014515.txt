BARRICUDAS

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 36

Polanco picked up a fumble and re-
turned it for score to push the Bar-
ricudas’ lead to 20-0.

“Our defense played very well,”
Cofiell said. “Aderemi Flores had
an interception and had a couple of
returns of 40 yards. Lejoni Williams
was all over the field and led us in
tackles.”

The Broncos added a late touch-
down from Diego Luna and two-
point conversion from Hernan Velez
for the final score.

“T was playing all my guys at that
point,” Cofiell said. “I wanted to give
everyone the experience of playing in
Puerto Rico.”

After the game, the Broncos set up
a meet-and-greet between both team
and an innovative idea came out of it.

“They took care of us all week-
end,” Cofiell said. “They gave us a
place to stay and ground transporta-
tion. They even took us sightseeing of
old San Juan before being dropped at
the airport.

“We invited them to come to St.
Croix and play us during the Vir-
gin Islands-Puerto Rico Friendship
weekend; hopefully it could be a
yearly thing. Either they come one
year or we go, this was a positive ex-
perience for us.”

“This was an amazing event,”
Juncos head coach Manuel Santiago
said. “We were very happy to host
them and we enjoyed them, too. This
was an excellent opportunity to open
our relationship and we are working
on coming to St. Croix in October.”

played teams from Puerto Rico last
month, losing to the Dorado Spartans
and University Garden Dolphins, re-
spectively, in games played at Lionel
Roberts Stadium.

“I think we should have a com-
bined league with Puerto Rico,” Co-
fiell said. “We play one home and one
away every year. Look, our ticket cost
$150, that’s not much more than fly-
ing to St. Thomas. It could be done.

But before we approach Puerto Rico,
we would need a unified league be-
tween St. Thomas and St. Croix
agreeing on stuff to make it happen.
Then we could move on to Puerto
Rico, They are not that far away.
“They are more Puerto Rican teams
than Virgin Islands teams. A mixed
schedule will have to be created with
a Caribbean champion between the
winners of each league. People are re-

ally interested in playing in football. If
we're going to grow, we need to play
good teams to get better and Puerto
Rico has been playing a while.”

The Puerto Rico High School Foot-
ball League is presently comprised of
seven teams — Antilles High School,
Baldrich Comets, Parque Central
Bluewaves, Parkville Steelers, Jun-
cos Broncos, Dorado Spartans and
the University Gardens Dolphins.
