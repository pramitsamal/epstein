A new life: Virgina, naw a mother-of-three, in
Australia

Virginia says: ‘Ghislaine said | was to start immediately and that someone would drive me home.

My father left and | was told to go upstairs.’ She was led by another woman through Epstein's
bedroom into a massage room where he lay face down naked on a table.

He started to interviewed Virginia. This was unconventional, but Virginia had no suspicions.
Presumably, she thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business.

Epstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer a virgin.

Virginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had
shown her in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter.

Virginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people. ‘My face was red with
embarrassment,’ she says. ‘But | felt under immense pressure to please them.

The whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I'd travel with Jeffrey on his
private jet and have a well-paid profession.’ Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to
return the next day.

That was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein.
For three of those years, she was under Florida’s age of consent, which is 18.
