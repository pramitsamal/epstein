What They Say About the Author

“Paul’s own writing, in particular, seemed daring and adventurous to
me; it took big chances and made important arguments in relentlessly funny
ways. I| felt, down deep, that maybe I had some of that in me, too; that maybe
I could be using my skills to better express my beliefs. Zhe Realist was the
inspiration that kept pushing me to the next level; there was no way I could
continue reading it and remain the same.”

--George Carlin

“Paul Krassner--confidant of Lenny Bruce, co-founder of the Yippies,
defiler of Disney characters, publisher of The Realist, and investigative
satirist extraordinaire. As soon as we decided to create the Huffington Post, |
knew I wanted him involved. His irreverence was just what the blog doctor
ordered.”

--Arianna Huffington

“Thanks to Paul Krassner for continuing to be the lobster claw in the
tuna casserole of modern America.”
--Tom Robbins

“Krassner loves ironies, especially stinging ironies that nettle public
figures. He would rather savor a piquant irony about a public figure than eat a
bowl of fresh strawberries and ice cream.”

--Ken Kesey

“T told Krassner one time that his writings made me hopeful. He found
this an odd compliment to offer a satirist. I explained that he made supposedly
serious matters seem ridiculous, and that this inspired many of his readers to
decide for themselves what was ridiculous and what was not. Knowing that
there were people doing that, better late than never, made me optimistic.”

--Kurt Vonnegut

“Mr. Krassner is an expert at ferreting out hypocrisy and absurdism
from the more solemn crannies of American culture.”

--The New York Times

“Krassner has the uncanny ability to alter your perceptions
permanently.”
