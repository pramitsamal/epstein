Life remains peaceful on a certain island off the coast of Japan. Here,
humans and animals live in peace and harmony.

There are monkeys who for eons have subsisted entirely on sweet
potatoes. They would pick the sweet potatoes right out of the dirt in which
they grow—eating them, dirt and all. This is the way they have always
done it. But one day, for whatever mysterious reason, an individual young
female monkey carried her sweet potato to the shore, washed the dirt off
in the ocean and proceeded to eat the sweet potato.

Who knows why it was this particular monkey? Any explanation will
suffice. Maybe she was an Aries, with a strong pioneer spirit. At any rate,
once this monkey broke the ice, other monkeys began to wash the dirt off
their sweet potatoes before they ate them. But only the young monkeys.

It was not until the 100th young monkey had washed the dirt off a
sweet potato in the ocean--not exactly the 100th; it could’ ve been the
93rd or the 108th; the 100th monkey is merely a metaphor for reaching
critical mass—but not until then did the first adu/t monkey wash the dirt
off a sweet potato. This was a case of reverse generational influence.

And then other adult monkeys started to imitate this behavior.

Washing the dirt off sweet potatoes even began to occur on adjoining
