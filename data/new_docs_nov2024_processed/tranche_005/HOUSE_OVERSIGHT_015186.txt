police car respects the force field he creates, and the cops drive around

choice. “I think I’ Il walk around in circles on the boardwalk today.” And
the next day. And the next. But somewhere along the way, walking around
in circles became a compulsion, and /t started doing Aim. When you play a
role long enough, the role can begin to play you if you’ re not careful.

I' ve been out at six o’ clock in the morning and there was the
Pacer walking in circles. I’ ve been out at six 0’ clock in the evening and

indicates that at some level he is still acting voluntarily. He walks in a
straight line to a greasy-spoon diner nearby on the boardwalk and sits at
the counter, but he doe not twirl on his stool, nor stir his coffee, nor roll
his eyes.

Once he talked about his obsessive activity: “I'’ m in control of
walking, but out of control too. When | walk I’ m in a trance. If | slow
down at night | see colors. | see millions of faces—some with Pilgrim hats,
some with cowboy hats—modern faces and prehistoric faces.”

faced Pacer keeps treading, even if it’ s circular--some unique relationship
