Jealousy At the Swingers Convention

The 24th annual Lifestyles Couples Convention has filled three hotels

in Palm Springs, California. The Convention Center is connected to one of
them, the Wyndham, which surrounds a large outdoor pool and patio
populated by couples busy socializing in 116-degree dry heat. Women and
men alike are wearing thongs. From afar they appear like so many eyeless
smiley faces among the bathing suits. The law that Sonny Bono signed
when he was mayor, banning thongs in public, does not apply to this
event, or, for that matter, to Cher.

The convention is for couples only. Except for me. I’ ve been hired
to perform stand-up comedy at their Friday luncheon, and |’ m here
alone. On the small, propellor plane from Los Angeles to Palm Springs, the
right side consists of two-seat rows, occupied entirely by couples on their
way to the convention—horny with the expectation of getting laid by the
spouse of a stranger, perhaps sitting in front of or behind them—and the
left side of the plane consists of one-seat rows, occupied entirely by me.

I' m afraid that the plane might tip over upon trying to land.
