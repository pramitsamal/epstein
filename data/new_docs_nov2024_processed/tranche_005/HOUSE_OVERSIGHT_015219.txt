When Tom Arnold was a guest on Late Show, David Letterman
pressed him about his friendship with Kathie Lee and Frank Gifford. This
was shortly after the G/obe had entrapped and videotaped Gifford’ s
extramarital tryst with a flight attendant in a hotel room. Letterman
insisted, “I don’ t revel in the miseries of others,” but Arnold reminded
him of his monologues with jokes about Gifford. Letterman defended
himself: “It’ s part of the job.” Arnold stammered, searching for just the
right words. He finally found them: “Frank Gifford took a bullet for a lot
of us.” And the audience applauded the accuracy of his assessment.

Certainly, non-celebrities don’ t have to worry about supermarket
tabloids revealing infidelities to the/r spouses. Such exposure could never
occur with swinging couples, not only because, as a rule, they are honest
with each other, but also because they party with each other, so there are
no surprises. They are sharing a secret lifestyle, one with an ethic that
transcends ordinary romance. Sneaky affairs are for straight people, but
swingers can eat their wedding cake and have their fantasies too. Which

explains why there have been no hookers hanging around fh/s convention.
