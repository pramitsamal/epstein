At breakfast the next morning, | was just about to apologize to the
kindly Christian woman whose home this was, explaining that a doctor had
recommended marijuana for my arthritis, but she apologized to me
because she hadn’ t told me in advance that smoking wasn’ t allowed.

“Some people are allergic to cigarette smoke,” she explained, and |
almost blurted out, “That wasn’ t tobacco, that was pot.”

| hope she doesn’ t read this.
