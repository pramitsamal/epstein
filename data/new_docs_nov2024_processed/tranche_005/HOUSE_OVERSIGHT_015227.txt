My friend Roy Zimmerman, who writes and sings satirical folk songs
in the tradition of Tom Lehrer, has a spoken piece of patter which goes: “I
just got back from the conspiracy convention. Have you been? It’ s fun.
Seven hundred conspiracy theorists all in one hotel, with the little name
tags, ‘Hello, my name is—none of your fucking business!’ Great
seminars— ‘Triangulation and You, ‘Paranoia for Profit,’ ‘Victoria’ s
Real Secret Was J. Edgar Hoover.’ In the lobby, | saw five people get off
the elevator—what, you think that’ s a coincidence? There was
entertainment, of course—a group of horny anti-government folk singers
called the Randy Weavers.”

Zimmerman was surprised to learn that there would actually be an
event such as the one that he thought he was making up. Although the
real conspiracy convention didn’ t have the seven hundred attendees he
had imagined, there were over 500, including 40% from out of state and
10% from other countries, including Canada, England, Australia, Denmark,
Austria and Ireland. Also taking place at the Santa Clara Convention Center
that same weekend as Conspiracy Con was the Charismatic Catholic

Convention. Dueling religions, together again.
