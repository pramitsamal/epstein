Subject: Re: Jeffrey Epstein case

Thank you, Paul. I had reached out to Joan previously to be included on Jack Scarola's e-mail distribution list
for the Dershowitz suit, but I wasn't sure if this would also be handled by them.

I don't want to double up or inundate you, as I know other ITN News colleagues have also been in touch with
you. I just wanted to make sure I was on your radar if Judge Marra rules next week.

Best,

Donna Paine

Subject: Jeffrey Epstein case

Hi Brad and Paul --
| had reached out to you both the other week when the allegations of Jane Doe #3 first
became public. | am a freelance TV producer in South Florida, working with ITN News on this story. As

you can imagine, given her allegations against Prince Andrew, ITN is quite keen on covering this story as
soon as it breaks.
