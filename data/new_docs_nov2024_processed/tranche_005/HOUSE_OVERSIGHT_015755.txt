The Imitation Game

s an experiment, I am going to ask a student to spend a week in
A: locked room. The room is perfectly nice; it has a bed, a light, a

desk, some reading matter, oh, and we'll give him some washing
facilities too! Every now and then I post some food under the door to
keep him going, Pop-tarts and pizza (thin-crust) work well.

On the first evening a note is pushed under his door with a symbol
on it. The student puzzles for a while, then opens the book sitting on
the desk. The book says, “If you get a piece of paper with symbols on it
look them up and follow the instructions.” He looks up the symbols and
the entry in the book says, “Go to page 44, write down the third symbol
on a piece of paper then post it back under the door.” He follows the
instruction and is rewarded with another piece of paper, this time with a
larger set of symbols on it. Again he follows the instructions in the book
and posts his answer back under the door. This goes on for several days.
He is somewhat bemused, but it passes the time, and he diligently looks
up the symbols and performs all the complicated actions as instructed.

Meanwhile, I meet our new Chinese graduate student and explain
to her she needs to interview a potential translator for the department.
He has just come in from Hong Kong and there is a health scare, so we
have quarantined him in the lab room. He is bored and I have some
paper for writing messages. She writes “hello” in Chinese on a piece of
paper and posts it under the door.
