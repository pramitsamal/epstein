in person for their second negotiation session, this time at the

H6fdi House in Reykjavik. For five days, the leaders talked alone
except for interpreters. Reagan badly wanted to develop the Strategic
Defense Initiative; known by its nickname, ‘Star Wars. The idea was to
put smart weaponry in space that could destroy ballistic missiles before
they reentered the atmosphere. Reagan believed this would remove the
threat of imminent destruction that had hung over the world since 1945.
Gorbachev, on the other hand, felt this was just another escalation in
the Cold War, and the Soviet Union would be forced to build yet more
weapons to overcome the American defenses. He wanted Reagan's plans
shelved, arguing that it broke the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. He was
probably right. The leaders talked back and forth, unable to overcome
the impasse. At the end of the summit there was a mad scramble to
announce some sort of deal, but this proved difficult. In the last moments
before they had to conclude a communiqué, Reagan suggested they
abolish ai/ nuclear weapons. Reagan's negotiating team was horrified and
shut the door.

For decades, the American strategy had been to use nuclear
weapons as a deterrent against the apparent numerical advantage of the
Soviets. In all the potential scenarios analyzed by the Pentagon, Russian
forces ended up overrunning American forward positions — otherwise
known as Western Europe! The only way to stop them was through a
release of nuclear weapons, which, inevitably escalated to all-out nuclear

at.
