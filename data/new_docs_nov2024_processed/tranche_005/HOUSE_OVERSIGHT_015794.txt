104 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

There are two problems with X-ray imaging. Even with clever
mathematics, the dense bone in the skull blocks the rays so you don't get
much contrast, making it hard to distinguish normal brain matter from
something like a tumor. But the bigger concern is X-rays are a form of
ionizing radiation, and ionizing radiation causes cancer.

We are told to wear sun block to protect our skin from ultraviolet
light; X-rays are 100 times more potent and can doa great deal of damage.
Fortunately, the body repairs itself quite well in the presence of low levels
of radiation. The double part of the double helix in our DNA allows a
set of proteins in our cells to go around correcting errors when they
detect a mismatch between the two strands. But, now and again an X-ray
might make an irreparable fault in both copies. If enough of these faults
accumulate, they can lead to cancer or, if the errors are in reproductive
organs, birth defects. Doctors try to minimize the radiation we receive
and give us as few CAT scans as possible during our lifetime, especially
when we are young and have not yet had children.

MRI

X-rays dominated our ability to see into the human body until the
mid-1970s when Raymond Damadian came up with the idea of using
magnetism. Magnetic fields are not absorbed by bone and present
no danger as they do not damage DNA. Ironically, the technique was
originally known as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, ‘NMR, which patients
thought must be dangerous because of the word nuclear. The name was
