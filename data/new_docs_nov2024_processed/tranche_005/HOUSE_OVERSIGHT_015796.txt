second later, and so on down to your feet. What you see at any one time
is a slice through a specific section of the body. You can then build up 3D
images from these slices and look at the soft watery tissue rather than the
hard bone you can see with an X-ray.

MRI scans give detailed images but today there are many more
imaging tricks you can play. Give the patient gadolinium to eat — a type
of paramagnetic material — and this contrast agent will highlight active
parts of the brain. You can ‘see’ which parts are active: the location of
emotions such as love, joy and even the effect of smells as the brain
experiences things. This is still coarse grained information; it shows only
the general area of excitation and it does not tell us what is going on at
the nerve level, but the images are fascinating.

Another recent development in imaging is the diffusion MRI. If you
remember your school physics, molecules travel with a random walk:
they diffuse along pathways just as people wander along a corridor. If the
corridor is full of people, they are jostled around and make little progress.
If the corridor is empty, they move in straight lines. This difference in
jostling affects the reading in an MRI and allows you to color code the
image according to the rate of motion of water along the pathways. You
can therefore ‘see’ the rate at which signals flow in the brain and not only
locate thoughts, but also see the links between them.
