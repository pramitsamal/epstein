McGurk Effect; Go to the Website and Watch the Linked Video

Chinese children tend to learn the piano very young, they don't lose the
absolute part of pitch. An astonishing 93% of these children develop and
retain perfect pitch throughout their lives.

There are many cross connections between the audio and video
processing systems. At parties you often can't hear speakers clearly because
of the background noise. Watching their lips will help comprehension,
but which sense wins if there is conflict between the two? The McGurk
effect shows this.

To test the effect, go to the website, watch the video and see if you
can distinguish when a speaker talking normally and when he is making
the mouth movement of another sound. There is a winner. Try it for
yourself; check out the link on my website.

Once upon a time people imagined the brain was like a camera
forming an image of the world, but if this were the case there would be
a paradox. Who is looking at the image in our brain to make sense of it?
Modern research shows we don’t take a complete picture of the world
like a camera but rather parse the image into its constituent parts on the
fly.

If someone asks, “Which side of the house is the tree on?” your
brain parses the question and compares it with the image map in your
mind’s eye. What is the image composed of: trees, houses, sky, grass?
Your brain manipulates the linguistic question about the relationship
of elements and matches it with the visio-spatial understanding of the
image, allowing you to answer the question. You might not have to answer
