You can see just how intensively the brain works on a given problem,
throwing away all unnecessary information.

The brain contains mirror neurons, a type of brain cell that
responds when we see another human do something. These neurons
fire as if we were performing the action ourselves even though we are
merely witnessing it. It is one of the ways we learn a skill. If] watch Tiger
Woods's golf swing, my mirror neurons will fire as if I were practicing
his swing. Later when I practice the swing for real, my neurons will have
already been partially programmed. This effect is presumably the reason
we enjoy watching sports; our mirror neurons allow us to begin acquiring
a skill while sitting in an armchair! This is clearly a useful evolutionary
trait but you do also need to practice for real!

Mirror neurons also fire in response to witnessing emotions. When
we see an actor laugh or cry, we experience their emotion as if for real.
This helps us empathize with the person we are watching and is part of
the reason we enjoy movies and plays.
