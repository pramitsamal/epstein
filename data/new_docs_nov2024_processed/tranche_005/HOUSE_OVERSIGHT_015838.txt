“No kitten that loves fish is
unteachable; No kitten without
a tail can play with a gorilla;
Kittens with whiskers will always
love fish; No teachable kitten

has green eyes; No kittens have
tails unless they have whisters;
hence...”

Lewis Carroll

“Once you eliminate the
impossible, whatever remains,
however improbably, must be the
truth.”

Sherlock Holmes,
Arthur Conan Doyle
