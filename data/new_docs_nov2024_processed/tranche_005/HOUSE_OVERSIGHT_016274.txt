When the machine no longer simply computes a function but instead maintains a
state, it can start to make inferences about the human by the sequence of requests
presented to it. And when different programs correlate across different request streams—
say, correlating Web-page searches with social-media posts, or the payment for services
on another platform, or the dwell time on a particular advertisement, or where the user
has walked or driven with their GPS-enabled smartphone—the total systems of many
programs communicating with one another and with databases leads to a whole new loss
of privacy. The great exploitative leap made by so many West Coast companies has been
to monetize those inferences without the knowing permission of the person generating the
interactions with the computing machine platforms.

Wiener, Turing, and von Neumann could not foresee the complexity of those
platforms, wherein the legal mumbo-jumbo of the terms-of-use contracts the humans
willingly enter into, without an inkling of what they entail, leads them to give up rights
they would never concede in a one-on-one interaction with another human being. The
computation platforms have become a shield behind which some companies hide in order
to inhumanly exploit others. In certain other countries, the governments carry out these
manipulations, and there the goal 1s not profits but the suppression of dissent.

Humankind has gotten itself into a fine pickle: We are being exploited by
companies that paradoxically deliver services we crave, and at the same time our lives
depend on many software-enabled systems that are open to attack. Getting ourselves out
of this mess will be a long-term project. It will involve engineering, legislation, and most
important, moral leadership. Moral leadership is the first and biggest challenge.
