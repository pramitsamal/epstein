for interpreting images and text have resulted from developing good models for vision
and language. Developing good models of people is the next frontier.

Of course, understanding how human minds work isn’t just a way to make
computers better at interacting with people. The trade-off between making mistakes and
thinking too much that characterizes human cognition is a trade-off faced by any real-
world intelligent agent. Human beings are an amazing example of systems that act
intelligently despite significant computational constraints. We’re quite good at
developing strategies that allow us to solve problems pretty well without working too
hard. Understanding how we do this will be a step toward making computers work
smarter, not harder.
