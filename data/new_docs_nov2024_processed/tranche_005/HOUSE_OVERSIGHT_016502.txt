so essential to public confidence in the system.” Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464
U.S. 501, 508 (1984) (citing Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. 569-71). For this reason, the
appellate briefs should be unsealed so that the public has the benefit of seeing the very
statements and arguments that formed the basis of this Court’s Decision. It is especially

People’s brief ... keeping intact those portions of the brief that recount the procedural history of
the SORA hearing, the portion of the brief that is seemingly of interest to the Post.” Browning

Aff. Ex. E. With all due respect to the District Attorney, the Post is simply not in a position to
