103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *850

It is [*851] unclear what portion of those incidents merit criminal prosecution. Key facts are often disputed, and while federal
and state jurisdiction are coextensive here, federal criminal law generally sets a higher bar for liability than state law, especially
due to its more onerous mens rea requirement. 7? That makes the former an imperfect backstop to the latter, because they are
only partially redundant. And as recent changes in federal policy suggest, 74 redundancy between governments is subject to
political shifts in those governments; federal oversight of state enforcement works only if federal officials are committed to the
oversight role. Moreover, keeping prosecution in the exclusive province of executive officials keeps prosecutorial discretion
more closely aligned with political majorities and thereby with popular sentiments about certain groups of defendants (such as
police officers) and victim groups (such as criminal suspects). In this context, redundancy in state law charging by courts or
private actors, rather than rival prosecutors, might make a real contribution. Finally, cases of sexual assault reveal a weakness
of federalism-based redundancy. State and federal criminal jurisdiction in the United States overlap more than elsewhere, but
they are not wholly coextensive. Federal prosecutors lack authority over most assaults that do not involve public officials or
federal [*852] property. Sexual assaults are one context in which the enforcement strategies favored in Europe and England -
regulated private prosecution or review of declination decisions - hold more promise.

I. UNDERENFORCEMENT AND REASONS NOT TO PROSECUTE
A. Sources of Unyustified Noncharging Decisions

Public prosecutors are the gatekeepers of criminal law enforcement, and justice systems employ a variety of safeguards against
prosecutors’ misjudgment, bias, incompetence, or laziness. Most are directed at prosecutors’ charging decisions rather than
decisions declining to charge (i.c., declination decisions), for familiar reasons - charging creates real burdens and risks for
defendants. *° Many familiar procedural components are aimed at preventing improper criminal charges or the harm they can
cause. Requirements that charges are based on sufficient evidence are an obvious example, but double jeopardy laws and
restrictions on prosecutors’ conflicts of interest serve the same purpose. The full range of pretrial and trial procedures designed
to assure accurate and unbiased adjudication are intended to sort out improper charges and attach punishments only to proper
ones. 7°

Safeguards against nonenforcement, or unjustified decisions not to prosecute, are fewer, are less explicit, and (in common law
jurisdictions) are less often in the form of legal rules and mandates. One explanation for this is simply that the interests at stake
are not as high - no individual faces prosecution and possible punishment. Another is that many non-prosecution decisions
