in effect, immortal—removes robots from the world of the vulnerable (at least robots of
the usually imagined sorts, with digital software and memories). If this isn’t obvious,
think about how human morality would be affected if we could make “backups” of
people every week, say. Diving headfirst on Saturday off a high bridge without benefit
of bungee cord would be a rush that you wouldn’t remember when your Friday night
backup was put online Sunday morning, but you could enjoy the videotape of your
apparent demise thereafter.

So what we are creating are not—should not be—conscious, humanoid agents but
an entirely new sort of entities, rather like oracles, with no conscience, no fear of death,
no distracting loves and hates, no personality (but all sorts of foibles and quirks that
would no doubt be identified as the “personality” of the system): boxes of truths (if we’ re
lucky) almost certainly contaminated with a scattering of falsehoods. It will be hard
enough learning to live with them without distracting ourselves with fantasies about the
Singularity in which these Als will enslave us, literally. The Auman use of human beings
will soon be changed—once again—forever, but we can take the tiller and steer between
some of the hazards if we take responsibility for our trajectory.
