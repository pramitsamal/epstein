“Because victims of sexual crimes are likely to suffer a ‘depth and range of emotion and
psychological disturbance. ..not felt by the victims felt by most other crimes’ we remind
lawyers and judges that the mere fact that such victims sought counseling may not be used
for impeachment purposes.”

Notwithstanding this warning, it seems quite likely that at least some rape victims would decline
to press charges if they knew that their treatment records could be rummaged through by defense
lawyers eager to discredit them.

The feminist lawyer, who successfully argued the appeal, had mixed feelings about the results,
acknowledging that she “had hurt the cause,” and that her victory for her client was “a step back
for women.” But she understood that her responsibility in this case was to this defendant, rather
than to future rape victims who she cared deeply about but who were not her clients. She did her
job, and she did it well.

This is another example of the “no free lunch” doctrine, in which doubts were resolved in favor of
defendants and against the victims of rape.
