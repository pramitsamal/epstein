encompassing statutory victims’ bill of rights. 7! Victims' advocates sought to expand on the protections found in other
previously-enacted victims' rights statutes, including, notably, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990. 7? That statute
had also included a bill of rights for crime victims, yet because of limited enforcement mechanisms, crime victims had been
unable to secure court protection of the rights listed in the statute. 73

The statute that Congress passed to solve these problems - the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004 - gave victims the right to
participate in the [*66] system.” 7+ It extended broad rights to crime victims, including the right to be treated with fairness

25 and the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the

and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy
Government in the case. 7° It also commanded that these rights must be afforded by the Justice Department and other
departments and agencies of the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime. 77 The CVRA
also contained specific enforcement mechanisms. The Act provided that rights can be asserted by the crime victim or the
crime victim's lawful representative, and the attorney for the Government ... ._ 28 The courts were also required under the Act

to ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights given by the law. 7?

Congress appeared to have at least two goals in mind in passing the CVRA. The first was simply to ensure that crime victims
understood what was happening in the criminal justice process. This goal is apparent from the fact that the CVRA gives crime
victims rights to notification about various court hearings, as well as more general rights to confer with prosecutors and to be
treated with fairness. 7° The CVRA's Senate sponsors explained:

In case after case we found victims, and their families, were ignored, cast aside, and treated as non-participants in a critical
event in their lives. They were kept in the dark by prosecutors too busy to care enough, by judges focused on [defendants']
rights, and by a court system that simply did not have a place for them. 3!

In passing the CVRA, Congress sought to change the system's obliviousness to crime victims that often left crime victims and

their families victimized yet again. 3?
