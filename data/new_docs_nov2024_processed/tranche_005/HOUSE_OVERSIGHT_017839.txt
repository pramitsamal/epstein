tacks, consisting of one speech in United

Even assuming that district court had
personal jurisdiction over Saudi Arabian
financial institutions in Antiterrorism Act
(ATA) action by survivors of victims of
September 11, 2001 attacks, Saudi Arabian
Prince’s position as officer of such institu-
tions was not basis for personal jurisdic-
tion over him, where there was no allega-
tion he had knowledge or involvement in
any al Qaeda accounts at any banks he
chaired. 18 U.S.C.A. § 2331 et seq.

The mere fact that a corporation is
subject to jurisdiction in New York does
not mean that individual officers may be
hauled before New York courts without
any showing that the individuals them-

business in New York.

Even assuming that name of founder
of Saudi Arabian company appeared in
“Golden Chain,” which allegedly listed ear-
ly direct donors to al Qaeda, such list was
insufficient to establish personal jurisdic-
tion in Antiterrorism Act (ATA) action by
survivors of victims of September 11, 2001
attacks, absent indications of who wrote
list, when it was written, or for what pur-
pose it was written. 18 U.S.C.A. § 2831 et

conspiracy culminating in attacks and did
not demonstrate that he purposefully di-

Limited discovery would be permitted,
at dismissal stage of Antiterrorism Act
(ATA) action by survivors of victims of
September 11, 2001 attacks, with regard to
whether Saudi Arabian bank’s contacts
with United States were sufficient for ex-
ercise of personal jurisdiction consistent
with due process, inasmuch as contacts,
including former presence of  bank’s
branch office and subsidiary in United
States, bank’s instigation of lawsuit in
United States, and its advertisements in
United States publications, when taken to-
gether, might establish personal jurisdic-
tion. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 5; 18

Allegations of survivors of victims of
September 11, 2001 attacks were insuffi-
cient to establish personal jurisdiction over
director of charity in Antiterrorism Act
(ATA) action, inasmuch as complaint did
not contain any specific actions by director
from which district court could infer that
he purposefully directed his activities at
United States, his affiliations with entities
that were alleged to have United States
contacts would not sustain jurisdiction, and
his being shareholder in United States
company was not sufficient for jurisdiction.
