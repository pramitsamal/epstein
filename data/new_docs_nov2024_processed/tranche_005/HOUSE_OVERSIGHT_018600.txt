slightly brown when done cooking. Without real eggs, they will not get that dark. They
will, however, turn a golden tan.

When they are done, remove them from the oven and allow them to sit on the sheet for
about a minute or two before placing them on a wire rack. Be careful with them as they
tend to be quite delicate until they have cooled.

Kickass Chocolate Cake
I think I modified this recipe from an Internet source too, but I can't find it now.
+ 1 1/2 cups FLOUR
+ 1 cup SUGAR
+ 1/2 cup UNSWEETENED COCOA
+ 1 tablespoon GROUND CLOVES
+ 1 teaspoon BAKING SODA
+ 1 teaspoon CAYENNE PEPPER
+ 1/4 teaspoon SALT
+ 1 cup ALMOND MILK (or COLD WATER)
+ 1/4 cup OIL
+ 1 tablespoon BALSAMIC VINEGAR

+ 1 tablespoon VANILLA (once I replaced this with ORANGE EXTRACT and added
some CINNAMON, and the result was amazing)

Preheat oven to baking temperature.

In a bowl beat together the OIL, SUGAR, SALT, SPICES and COCOA until well-
combined. Add the remaining ingredients, and stir until well-combined. Pour into a
greased enamel plate or cake dish and bake 20-30 minutes. Don't worry if the batter tastes
quite spicy -- it mellows out a lot, when you bake it so that the end result is more
chocolate with a spicy after-taste. Cool.

Then mix the following ingredients together, and pour the resultant icing on top:
+ 1 cup POWDERED SUGAR
+ 1/2 cup UNSWEETENED COCOA
+ 6 tablespoons COCONUT MILK (or ALMOND MILK or SOY MILK)
Tofu Tikka Masala

This is a modified recipe that originated with a friend.
+ 5 tablespoons OIL

+ 2 medium ONIONS, thinly sliced
