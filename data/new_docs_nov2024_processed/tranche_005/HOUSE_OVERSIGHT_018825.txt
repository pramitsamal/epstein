In terms of stopover tourists, the U.S. Virgin Islands ranks 7 in the list of the top tourism markets in
the Caribbean, with 2014 stay-over arrivals of about 730,000. The year 2014 indicated modest growth
in arrivals, with 3.90% growth over the prior period. The chart below illustrates the relationship
between arrivals and GDP. We note that the continuing downturn in GDP is likely due to negative
influences outside the tourism sector, such as the 2012 closure of the Hovensa oil refinery in St. Croix.
