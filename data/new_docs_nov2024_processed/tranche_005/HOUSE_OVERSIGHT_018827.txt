According to STR, there are 453 rooms in the active pipeline, which would add 8.6% to the existing
room stock of 4,818 rooms. These projects include the 153-room, proposed Embassy Suites in the
mahogany Run area, and the 300-room, proposed Hyatt Regency in Mandal Bay. In addition, a hotel
project was recently announced on Water Island; however, the developers have not yet announced a
brand or number of proposed rooms.

Housing / Property

As the supply of housing has increased in the last two decades, homeownership rates have also
increased, although only slightly. Rates increased 1.9 percentage points between 2000 and 2010, and
increased an additional 3.8 percentage points from 2010 to 2012. Average home prices dropped by
11.8 percent in 2008, but then increased in 2009 and 2010 by 4 percent and 12.3 percent,
respectively. In 2012, average home prices fell 17.4% and then rebounded in 2013 with an increase of
22.1%. The average sales price in 2013 was $538,369. Presumably, much of the increased supply of
new homes and condominiums has gone to non-residents and vacationers. Over the past decade,
housing costs have accelerated at a far greater pace than resident incomes, putting home ownership
beyond the reach of all but a few relatively wealthy islanders.

In 2013, St. Thomas and St. John had an average home sale price of $713,183, while the average home
sale price in St. Croix was $306,083. While prices have not caught up with what they were in 2007, St.
Thomas and St. John have seen some recovery in the overall housing market. St. Croix, however,
continues to suffer from the closing of the Hovensa refinery. In 2014, the average single family home
sales price in St. Croix was $334,167, while in St. Thomas it was $909,839. 2015 year to date averages
are show an increase in average single family home price in St. Croix and a decrease in St. Thomas and
St. John, with averages of $414,178 and $759,811 respectively.
