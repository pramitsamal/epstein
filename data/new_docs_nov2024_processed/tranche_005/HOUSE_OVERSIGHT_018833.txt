Surrounding Area Analysis 23

building with a mixture of office and retail. There are other small retail commercial buildings both
along the waterfront and the inland side of the road; such as restaurants, bars and a convenience
store/gas outlet.

In addition to the drawing power of these retail users, the lvanna Eudora Kean High School is located
approximately 1,500 feet west of the subject property.

During the last several years, development has been predominantly of retail/office uses. The largest
recent development in this area has been East End Plaza, which was constructed in 2008. However,
the completion of this commercial building coincided with the downturn in the overall economy in the
territory, and the property has struggled to reach stabilization. There is also a newly constructed,
small commercial strip center in close proximity to the subject called Crosswinds Center that opened
approximately two years ago. Ace Hardware is the anchor tenant in this building, while the majority of
the other commercial bays remain vacant.

There have also been two notable bar/restaurant openings within the past two years, both at the
subject property. Near the subject, a Senor Frogs restaurant opened in November 2013 featuring a
dining and nightclub atmosphere. Additionally, a tavern/restaurant called Tap & Still has opened
approximately 450 feet southwest of the subject. A new Thai/Sushi restaurant is under construction
within Red Hook Plaza, just west of the subject. These new establishments are indicative of the
improving retail/commercial climate of the Red Hook area.

Outlook and Conclusions

The area is in the slow growth stage of its life cycle. There have been signs of increased demand as
existing commercial space has been leasing up more rapidly over the past six months, showing the
upside of the subject’s area. We anticipate that property values will slightly increase in the near
future.
