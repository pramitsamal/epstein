And not everyone is inclined to support the same causes. A fundraiser and
public relations expert of extraordinary ability recognizes this—can find,
target, and approach the correct people for their cause, and then recruit them
with the correct individual enticements. Repeating myself, this is a very
difficult thing to pull off. Hillwas able to pull this off amazingly, not only
with great efficiency and success, but with also great ease and grace; and she
is on a roll—and it doesn’t look like she will stop anytime soon.

These are my qualified opinions: I am no stranger to raising money for
children. Every year, I travel all across the country and the world to perform
magic for children’s hospital wards, burn units and juvenile wards, including
Spofford, Bridges, Horizon, and Crossroads. I spent time performing magic
for Paul Newman and the children diagnosed with serious illnesses at the
Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, among many other charitable activities.

I’ve been discussing with HB how we can work together in raising
money for children and education. Therefore, | wholeheartedly support her
visa application. If her visa application is approved, I don’t see why we
wouldn’t combine our unique forms of magic and help the world’s children!

Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or
concerns.

Best Regards,

David Blaine
