inquiries and events on topics such as the United Kingdom's Confucius Institutes.**

as primarily collaborative, it is also conducting research on Chinese influence and
interference activities.?> At the international level, the United Kingdom has joined
several open letters to signal its position on China’s violations of human rights.”

Civil society has also sought to raise the Foreign NGO Management Law as well as

to highlight intensified repression. By contrast, responses from academic institutions

academic freedom and maintaining wider ethical standards in the face of these types
of campaigns.”?
