“In 1998, I found myself in Aparan, a large town an hour’s drive from Armenia’s capital, Yerevan. A local dance troupe
was performing that evening, in the open air, with most of the suburb in attendance. As soon as I took my first shot, an
old man approached me,” said French photographer Antoine Agoudjian. “Tears streamed down his face. He told me that
his son had died. That he had been electrocuted, that he was his pride and joy, and that I looked just like him. He broke
into sobs and moved towards me with outstretched arms. His name was Ishran. I asked if he would dance for me, and he
began dancing. The troupe paused and perched on an outcrop of rocks in the background. It was beautiful, not because
the man is beautiful, but because he represents something deep inside the collective consciousness of the Armenian

community: a celebratory resilience in the face of overwhelming loss.”
