MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Thank you. I had also
asked for all of the information regarding
communications with Rebecca, which I was told
that I would get today. Is that available?

MR. SCOTT: No. I told you that we would
consider if that -- I apologize. I said we will
consider that and you can put it in a request and
we will respond.

THE WITNESS: I would sure like to see that
before I answer any more questions. Is that
something you could make available?

MR. SIMPSON: I don't think that's necessary
to answer the questions I'm going to ask. I'm
not going to ask you any questions -- I won't ask
you any questions about Professor Dershowitz's
communications with this Rebecca that you've
heard about. You were in the room while he
testified, correct?

THE WITNESS: Right, but I mean there are --
there are broader subjects that extend beyond
those communications, so if you're going to ask
any questions about those broader subjects, I
would like to see the communications. That would

be helpful to me.
