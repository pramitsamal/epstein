But it seems that Epstein did work hard to untangle Wexner's
finances. And it appears he succeeded. “Jeffrey cleaned that up
right away,” 4 former associate of Epstein’s says.

The two men became all but inseparable.

“Very smart, with a combination of excellent judgment and
unusually high standards,” Wexner said of Epstein at the time.
“Also, he is always a most loyal friend.”

When Wexner wanted to break up with a woman he'd been
dating for several years — a woman who moved to Ohio and con-
verted to Judaism to make him happy — he dispatched Epstein
to do the dirty work.

When Wexner hired a decorator for his Ohio mansion and
wanted someone to verify the authenticity of several expensive
antiques, Epstein flew in his friend Stuart Pivar, the renowned
art collector and author. (According to Pivar, most of the antiques
were cheap imitations.) When Wexner traveled abroad, he'd
bring back trinkets and gifts for Epstein. When Wexner wanted
to see Cats, Epstein arranged to have the cast perform in his

mansion.

In Ohio, Wexner’s associates whispered about his relationship 7

with Jeffrey Epstein. In New York, they wondered about Epstein'’s 4

role in Wexner’s 1993 marriage to Abigail Koppel.

At thirty-one, Koppel was twenty-four years Wexner’s junior. ;
It was Epstein who negotiated the prenuptial agreement and
orchestrated its very strange signing. Abigail signed the agree f
ment in her law office. Wexner signed it in his office. According ©
