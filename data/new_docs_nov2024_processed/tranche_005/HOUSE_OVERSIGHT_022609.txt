66 See, Cs Complaint, SEC v. Siemens AG, supra note 48; Criminal
Information, United States v. Siemens AG, supra note 48,
S7Tn amending the FCPA in 1988, Congress made clear that the business
purpose element, and specifically the “retaining business” prong, was
meant to be interpreted broadly:

The Conferees wish to make clear that the reference

to corrupt payments for “retaining business” in

present law is not limited to the renewal of contracts

or other business, but also includes a prohibition

against corrupt payments related to the execution

or performance of contracts or the carrying out of

existing business, such as a payment toa foreign

official for the purpose of obtaining more favorable

tax treatment. The term should not, however, be

construed so broadly as to include lobbying or other

normal representations to government officials.

” Id. at 749. Indeed, the Kay court found that Congress’ explicit
exclusion of facilitation payments from the scope of the FCPA was
evidence that “Congress intended for the FCPA to prohibit ad/ other
illicit payments that are intended to influence non-trivial official foreign
action in an effort to aid in obtaining or retaining business for some
person.” Jd. at 749-50 (emphasis added).
1 Td. at 750.
” Id, at 749-55.
? Td. at 756 (“Te still must be shown that the bribery was intended to
produce an effect—here, through tax savings—that would ‘assist in
obtaining or retaining business.”).
7 The FCPA does not explicitly define “corruptly, but in drafting the
statute Congress adopted the meaning ascribed to the same term in the
domestic bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201(b). See H.R. Rep. No. 95-640,
at 7.
5 The House Report states in full:

‘The word “corruptly” is used in order to make

clear that the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must

be intended to induce the recipient to misuse

his official position; for example, wrongfully to

direct business to the payor or his client, to obtain

preferential legislation or regulations, or to induce a

foreign official to fail to perform an official function.

‘The word “corruptly” connotes an evil motive or

purpose such as that required under 18 US.C.

201(b) which prohibits domestic bribery. As in

18 US.C. 201(b), the word “corruptly” indicates

an intent or desire wrongfully to influence the

recipient. It does not require that the act [be] fully

consummated or succeed in producing the desired

outcome.
Id. The Senate Report provides a nearly identical explanation of the
meaning of the term:

‘The word “corruptly” is used in order to make

clear that the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must

be intended to induce the recipient to misuse

his official position in order to wrongfully direct

business to the payor or his client, or to obtain
