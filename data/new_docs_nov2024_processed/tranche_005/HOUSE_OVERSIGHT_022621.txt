information” to mean information that:

(A) is derived from the independent knowledge

or analysis of a whistleblower; (B) is not known

to the Commission from any other source, unless

the whistleblower is the original source of the

and the final rules on eligibility, Exchange Act Rule 21F-8, 17 C.ER.§
240.2 1F-8.
3% For example, the rules: (1) make a whistleblower eligible for an award.
if the whistleblower reports original information internally, and the
company informs the SEC about the violations; (2) give whistleblowers
120 days to report information to the SEC after first reporting
internally and still be treated as if he or she had reported to the SEC

at the earlier reporting date , thus preserving their “place in line” for

a possible whistleblower award from the SEC; and (3) provide that a
whistleblower’s voluntary participation in an entity's internal compliance
and reporting systems is a factor that can increase the amount of an
award, and that a whistleblower’s interference with internal compliance
and reporting system is a factor that can decrease the amount of an award.

397 For example, SEC staff will not disclose a whistleblower’s identity in
response to requests under the Freedom of Information Act. However,
there are limits on SEC’s ability to shield a whistleblower’s identity,

and in certain circumstances SEC must disclose it to outside entities.
For example, in an administrative or court proceeding, SEC may be
required to produce documents or other information that would

reveal the whistleblower’s identity. In addition, as part of ongoing

SEC investigatory responsibilities, SEC staff may use information
provided by a whistleblower during the course of the investigation. In
appropriate circumstances, SEC may also provide information, subject
to confidentiality requirements, to other governmental or regulatory
entities. Exchange Act Rule 21F-7(a), 17 C.AR. 240.21F-7(a).

398 Although SEC does not have an opinion procedure release process,
it has declared its decision to follow the guidance announced through
DOJ’s FCPA Opinion Release Procedure. US. Sec. and Exchange
Comm., SEC Release No. 34-17099 (Aug. 29, 1980), available at hetp://
www.sec.gov/news/digest/1980/dig082980.pdf. SEC Release No. 34-
17099 stated that, to encourage issuers to take advantage of the DOJ’s
FCPA Review Procedure, as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, SEC
would “not take enforcement action alleging violations of Section 30A
in any case where an issuer has sought and obtained an FCPA Review
letter from the Department, prior to May 31, 1981, stating that the
Department will not take enforcement action under Section 30A with
respect to the transaction involved.” Jd. The release further noted that it
would revisit this policy once the DOJ had evaluated the results of the
FCPA Review Procedure after its first year of operation. A second release
stated that the SEC would continue to adhere to the policy announced
in Release No. 34-17099. USS. Sec. and Exchange Comm., SEC Release
No. 34-18255 (Nov. 13, 1981), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/
