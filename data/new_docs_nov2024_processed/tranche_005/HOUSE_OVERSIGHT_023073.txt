While the effective tax rate of the S&P 500 is generally about 28% (currently closer to
25% due to the recent commodity recession), we estimate that the tax rate for the S&P
500’s domestic operations is much higher at roughly 33% — although this includes
state and local taxes. If all companies with tax rates above the proposed new tax rate of
20% were to drop to 20%, and no companies provisioned for US taxes on foreign
profits, we estimate the domestic effective tax rate for the S&P 500 would fall in line
with its foreign tax rate of roughly 19%. This would represent a 9ppt decrease in the
current S&P 500 tax rate and a 12% increase in EPS. We show the sensitivity to S&P
500 EPS to different assumed tax rates in the chart below, but we reiterate that these
estimates exaggerate the actual impact on profits, as a significant portion of these
benefits would likely be passed on to consumers via lower prices. We assume that in
aggregate, roughly half of the gains from the lower tax rate would be retained (i.e. half
of the amounts shown in the sensitivity analysis in Chart 2).

Note: Our base case assumes that half of the benefit would be passed on to customers, competed
away or offset by other changes to the tax code. Thus, we woulld expect the uplift to our EPS forecast
to be roughly half the calculated benefit from simply lowering the corporate tax rate.

The market is beginning to price in the benefits of tax cuts , but we may still be in the
early days — note that potential beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus (i.e. infrastructure
spending) have seen an 18% multiple re-rating but de minimis fundamental support,
whereas potential beneficiaries of lower corporate tax rates have seen performance
driven nearly equivalently by multiples and earnings.
