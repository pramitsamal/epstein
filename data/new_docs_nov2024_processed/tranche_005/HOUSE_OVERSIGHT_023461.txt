Mohammed in the year 632; Sunnis have regarded them as a heretical
sect ever since. Arabs and Persians, along with many others, have
vied for the land and resources of the Middle East for almost as long.
These days, geopolitics also plays a role. The two sides have
assembled loosely allied camps. [ran holds in its sway Syria and the

opposed to the West and Israel.

For decades, the two sides have carried out a complicated game of

the Saudis backed Sunni militias.

But the maneuvering extends far beyond the well-worn battleground
of Lebanon. Two years ago, the Saudis discovered Iranian efforts to
spread Shiite doctrine in Morocco and to use some mosques in the
country as a base for similar efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. After
Saudi emissaries delivered this information to King Hassan II,
Morocco angrily severed diplomatic relations with Iran, according to
Saudi officials and cables obtained by the organization WikiLeaks.

eruption that still looms large in the psyches of both nations. It
