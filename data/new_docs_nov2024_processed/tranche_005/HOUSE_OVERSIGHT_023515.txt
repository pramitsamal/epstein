the wrong side in Tunisia. But the president’s instinct to save
Benghazi and to oust Ivory Coast’s usurper was right.

Sarkozy has intuited three things. First, the democratization of the
Arab world is the most important European strategic challenge of the
decade. Second, it was time “to take the training wheels off,” in the
words of Constanze Stelzenmiiller of the German Marshall Fund, and
have Europe rather than an overextended America lead in Libya.
Third, the U.N. cannot always be an umbrella that folds when it rains.
If its “responsibility to protect” means anything, it must be when an
Arab tyrant promises to slaughter his people.

We stand at a high point in French postwar diplomacy and a nadir in
German. There were strong arguments on either side of a Libyan
intervention, but with a massacre looming in Benghazi, Germany had
to stand with its allies. Angela Merkel has proved herself more a
maneuverer than a leader. Germany often conveys the sense that it
now resents the agents of its postwar rehabilitation — the European
Union and NATO.

I don’t think Germany believes its future lies with the BRIC
countries, as the U.N. Libya vote suggested. I do think Germany has
entered a new era of ambivalence and nationalist calculation.

That means several things. European integration is on hold, and as
long it’s on hold the future of the euro is at risk. The German-French
alliance will remain under strain. Obama should look to Sarkozy, not
Merkel, for strategic support.

A last thought. This restless French leader is at his best with his back
to the wall. He’s shown that. The same quality means it would be
foolish to count him out next year.
