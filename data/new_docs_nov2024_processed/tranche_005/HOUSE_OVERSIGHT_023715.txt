Quest: The U.S.
president talked
about selling
large amounts of
agriculture to the
Chinese, and
tariffs on
automobiles
down from 40%
maybe to 0%.
This is
mercantilist stuff.
This isn’t “trade
deal.”

RLK: Totally
agree with that.
And those are
superficial things,
they make
headlines, they're
easy to
understand, but
they’re not the
substance of
what's happening
here.

QUEST MEANS
