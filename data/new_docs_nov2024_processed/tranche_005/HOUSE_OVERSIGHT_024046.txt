Favorable conditions for biopharmaceutical investments for NLV-III

The Fund Managers believe that NLV-III will be invested in a market with attractive conditions
for investment in the biopharmaceutical sector. As a result, the Fund should have the
opportunity to invest in compelling biopharmaceutical opportunities that have attractive risk-
return profiles. A number of factors support this positive view of the investment thesis in the
biopharmaceuticals sector.

First, the Fund will invest in a portfolio of biopharmaceutical companies with an emphasis on
those that are developing targeted therapeutic opportunities that address mechanisms of
disease at the molecular level with high specificity and offer meaningful efficacy and safety
benefits to specific sub-groups of patients. Where possible, the Fund will look to invest in
companies with product programs that are guided by validated biomarkers that can enable
highly specific patient selection and provide an objective measurement of drug effect. The
Fund Managers believe that opportunities with these characteristics offer important benefits to
all market participants in the biopharmaceuticals sector, and that these substantially de-risk the
R&D and commercial sides of the biopharmaceutical business model in ways that can
meaningfully benefit investors.

Patients are offered therapies that are more targeted to their disease, and benefit from
improvements in efficacy and safety through increased life expectancy, improved quality of life,
and a more rapid return to a fully productive life;

Physicians have access to an arsenal of products that they can choose from to tailor therapy to
specific patients’ disease, and avoid the costs and risks associated with using less effective
therapies that carry all the safety risks, but may or may not have any effect on the specific
disease subtype of an individual patient;

Payers may pay higher prices for these therapies, but with the enhanced efficacy and safety
profile that’s possible with biomarker based targeting, they can expect to see better overall
patient outcomes, that ultimately save money within the system;

Pharmaceutical Companies benefit because with targeted approaches to drug discovery and

development, the probabilities of success improve, interactions with regulators become less
risky, timelines to move products from the lab to the market can be significantly shortened, and
