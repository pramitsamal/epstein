CASE STUDY: ChangeTip

Changelip enables a “tipping” feature using Bitcoin on other companies’ websites. It
has built a Bitcoin micropayment platform that is currently integrated with Twitter,
GitHub, Reddit, Google+, Tumblr, and YouTube.

We believe that ChangeTip’s micro transaction platform is poised to be the financial
equivalent of the “Like” button, and enabling new mechanisms for premium online
constant to be monetized.
