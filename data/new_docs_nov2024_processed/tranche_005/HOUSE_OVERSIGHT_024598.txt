remarkably inspiring. But with Qadhafi, again, it's always the me,
and that goes back to your narcissism. He has a very difficult time, as
most narcissists do, empathizing with the pain and suffering of
others. Everything is about him.

So how do you see this playing out for Libya?

Well, it's quite clear that the rebels are in control, but things will not
really be fully clarified until Qadhafi is either killed, forced to
surrender when there's no one left around him or goes down in a
blaze of bullets. I gather there has been some talk about him going
into exile in Tunisia. That's not totally out of the question, but if he
does so, that's not with the idea of giving up so much as temporarily
taking refuge there in order to continue on as the leader of Libya.

So I think that there's every reason to believe that what we are seeing
is the last act, but it could be prolonged until they actually succeed in
capturing him. Of course part of what makes it so difficult for him to
leave is the indictment by the International Criminal Court in the
Hague. His son Saif al-Islam is also indicted for crimes against
humanity. So there really is no way out for him. I think it's important
to note that his most important audience is the mirror. And when he
says these things he really does believe them. It's sounds crazy, but
it's kind of like, Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the most
important Muslim Arab Third World leader of them all? And the
answer is, You, Muammar. He is really going have a very difficult
time seeing people celebrating his going down, in terms of trying to
sustain that heroic inner image.
