CHAPTER VIII
Top 100
Private Cannabis Companies 2018

In this chapter, we present our current list of the Top 100 Private Cannabis Companies. Our determi-
nation to include companies on the list is subjective, and the list is intended to be a cross-section of the
types of companies in the cannabis industry. Our list comprises privately held companies, primarily
U.S. companies, companies we believe have a strong reputation or position in their market segments
and companies pursuing a line of business we consider promising. We intend to update our list period-
ically, and we expect it may change significantly over time.

Most companies on our list are in early stages of development, and many will need to raise capital to
succeed. Raising capital for early-stage companies in any industry is extremely challenging. Early-stage
cannabis companies seeking capital face the same challenges as early-stage companies in other indus-
tries but must also address challenges unique to the cannabis industry. Although we hope the compa-
nies on our list ultimately succeed, we expect some will go out of business for any number of reasons,
including lack of access to capital.

Inclusion in our list does not represent an investment recommendation or endorsement of any
particular company or product. We have made investments in and conducted investment banking and
other services for companies included in the 7op 100 Private Cannabis Companies 2018 list, and may
do so in the future. Readers should be aware that we may have a conflict of interest that could affect the
objectivity of our decision to include a company in the list. For additional disclosures and disclaimers,
see page 175.
