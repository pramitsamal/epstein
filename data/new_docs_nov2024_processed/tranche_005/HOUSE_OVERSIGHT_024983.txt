Up, Up, and Away

As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has flown more than half a
million miles to 80 countries in her two and a half years on the job.
Her plane looks like Air Force One on the outside, but isn’t as grand
on the inside. It’s one of four Boeing 757s that the military fitted with
15 ordinary coach seats for reporters in the rear, a business-class staff

between them, but now no one knew what would happen en route. “It
was uncomfortable, but everyone was extremely professional,” said
one official aboard.

she loudly tells the flight attendants only moments before sauntering
into the staff cabin, brownie already in hand: “I know—I’ve been
bad.” Occasional cupcakes with candles are also exempt because
Hillary is religious about observing staff birthdays. She resists
