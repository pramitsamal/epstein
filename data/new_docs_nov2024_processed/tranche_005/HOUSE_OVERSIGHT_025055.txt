region as a major power.

The P5+1, which are due to meet Iran later
this month, remain so divided that they are
unlikely to improve substantially on their
previous miserly offer, which was to
provide Iran with some airplane spare parts
if it gave up uranium enrichment to 20% --
its trump card. It is the paralysis of Iran’s
dealings with the P5+1 that has lent
credence to the idea that the best hope of a
breakthrough may lie in bilateral U.S.-
Iranian talks -- perhaps even a summit
meeting between President Obama and
Ayatollah Khomeini.

For such a summit to be successful the
United States would have to change its
approach. Iran’s supreme leader has made
clear that Iran will not negotiate under
