Although cryptocurrencies cannot be spent without control of the corresponding private keys, care must be taken to
protect those private keys. Many bitcoin owners allow exchanges to custody their private keys, which leaves them
vulnerable:

— Ifhackers are able to access owners’ private keys, they can deplete owners’ digital wallets.
— As of August 2016, Reuters reported that a third of bitcoin exchanges had been hacked.!
— Ethereum’s recent Parity hack 1s the first time a coding error has resulted in a loss of funds.

Estimates vary but suggest that hackers have stolen at least several hundred million dollars of cryptocurrencies.
