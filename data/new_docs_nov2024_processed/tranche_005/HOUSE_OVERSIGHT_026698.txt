Positivity towards Germany amidst concerns
for Continental Europe
Brexit has raised awareness of the related threat
of wider EU disbandment, although this has had
a relatively small effect on Continental European
allocations on the whole (from 12.8% of AUM in 2016
to 11.2% in 2017). Instead, it has caused sovereigns
to focus on the more stable countries within the EU.
Sovereign investments in Germany have increased
based on its economic strength (with its attractiveness
increasing year-on-year in figure 10), and many
respondents attribute this to Germany's industrial
sector (an estimated 30.3% of GDP relative to 19.2%
in the UK, 19.4% in France and 23.9% in Italy).
However, investment sovereigns identified German
financial markets as an area of potential growth
post-Brexit, offering a stable platform for investments
across Europe. Furthermore, liability sovereigns
explained that if the eurozone were to disband,
Germany's role as the financial hub of Europe would
have significant upside for the German currency,
with many funds building currency hedging strategies
to take this into account.
