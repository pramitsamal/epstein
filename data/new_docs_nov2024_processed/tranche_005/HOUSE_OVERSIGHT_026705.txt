Real estate offers income generation and

access optionality

This year, sovereigns cited a range of reasons for
increasing target real estate allocations, including
the scope to capture liquidity alpha, the potential

to generate income matching mid- to long-term
liabilities and the potential for internalisation and
control. With lower interest rates, lower funding
commitments to sovereigns and a lack of appetite
to vary asset allocations, the potential for leveraged
participation in real estate (equity and debt) appeals
to sovereigns seeking alternative means of scaling
‘frozen’ asset allocation to match liabilities.

In addition, while there are few alternatives to
third-party management and fee structures across
infrastructure and private equity (with co-investment
in many cases challenged by fund governance and
risk appetite), sovereigns have a broad range of
options to participate in the development, acquisition
and management of real estate. Indeed, there was
no consensus among sovereigns on the best placed
real estate manager, with internal and external
managers, developers and operators cited as
preferred real estate partners in figure 16. Sovereigns
are also attracted to the flexibility of real estate value
chain participation as it reduces upfront funding
commitments and allows for a gradual internalisation
of expertise and resource.
