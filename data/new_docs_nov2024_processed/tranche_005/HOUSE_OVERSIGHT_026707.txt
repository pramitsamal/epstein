‘home market’ to match liabilities
While real estate allocations account for a small
portion of sovereign portfolios, there has been Fixed income
significant relative growth in allocations, particularly
in sovereign home markets (figure 17).
Home market real estate is attractive for liability
and investment sovereigns, as there is no need to
hedge currency exposure, as outlined in theme 2.
The increase in home market allocations is mirrored
in sovereign appetite for income-generating real
estate assets (with yield generation the lead factor for
increased allocations shown in figure 18), matching
home currency-denominated liabilities at higher yields
than domestic fixed income. Consequently, the tilt to
real estate in home markets is substantially funded
from lower allocations to fixed income (figure 19).
Home market allocations also benefited from the
trend to internalisation of real asset management.
With limited capability to source and manage real
estate globally, sovereigns noted that internal =
investment teams focused more on the local market, Equities
particularly in respect of greenfield or residential
investments. Domestic real estate investment was
greatest among Western and Asian sovereigns (4.9%
and 3.1% of assets respectively), due to the depth
of high-quality domestic real estate markets. Home
markets were viewed as more familiar and accessible;
there was a view that proximity facilitated oversight
and control, which in turn afforded greater comfort
in higher risk categories. Many respondents were also
more confident in their ability to pitch for real estate
deals locally, given the positive reputation
of sovereign investors.
