RLK: I think there has to be some
backchannel working. To put the
real situation on the table, there are
five major issues that the US is
concerned about in addition to the
trade deficit. The trade deficit is
actually complicated because there
are services of $40 billion dollars
that Chinese tourists and students
pay. It's not excluding the transfer
pricing of components that are
shipped into China. So the trade
deficit, which benefits a lot of
American consumers with cheaper
products at a good quality is not as
relevant as popular opinion would
suggest.

RLK: Most experts do not really
focus on the trade deficit. American
experts focus on five things: the
lack of open Chinese markets;
intellectual property protection,
industrial espionage, including
cyber theft; tech transfer being
forced (in joint ventures);, and
Chinese government subsidies for
critical technologies or industries.
