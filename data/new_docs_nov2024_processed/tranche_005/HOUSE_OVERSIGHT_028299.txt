Sunday, 10 October 2010
Curators Victoria Golembiovskaya and Wolfe Von Lenkiewicz, in collaboration with the Saatchi Gallery and

Channel 4's New Sensations, will host an art exhibition starting next Sunday showcasing famous works by artists
such as Paul Cezanne and Pablo Picasso.

The House of the Nobleman exhibit, which coincides with the Frieze Art Fair, will be held at the mansion No 2
Cornwall Terrace in Regents Park and will include works from several international art collections. No 2 Cornwall
Terrace has been extensively redeveloped by developer Oakmayne Bespoke and is part of a much larger
redevelopment of Cornwall Terrace to create eight mansions. The houses are up for sale starting at £29m.
