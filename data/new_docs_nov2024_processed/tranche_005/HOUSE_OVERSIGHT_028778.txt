States must get in front of this negative trend before spreads across Africa and it is too late. The U.S. should
call for President Sall to honor the request of the UN Working Group and release his political rival Mr. Wade
and also keep his pledge of a 5 year presidential mandate. President Obama has said that Africa is more
important than ever to security and prosperity in the U.S. We have worked very hard in implementing and
prioritizing democracy and democratic succession in Africa. The Obama administration must not let our hard
work be compromised in Senegal, we have worked too hard and come too far.

Subject: Revised letter. Arbitrary detention of Mr. Wade

Dear Vinoda and Bob,

Please see attached the last version of the revised draft letter. We have made some modifications and amendments
we submit to your proposal. You can finalize the letter as it suits you. We strongly recommend to wait Wednesday
or Tuesday this week before sending the letter as Amnesty International will issue on Wednesday 24 February
its worldwide report on human right situation. It is highly probable that major statement will be made on Mr.
Wade case in the report on Senegal, which will give us more input for the letter.

Many thanks and best regards.
