We don’t teach children language either, contrary to many beliefs. The visual grammar just grows, and as is known,
can develop in various ways depending on early experience. Same with the language grammar, though the period in
which experience has a shaping effect is much longer.

However, there are fundamental differences between vision and language. Can send you a recent paper about it if
you like. Vision is an input system. Language isn’t. It’s an internal capacity, a system of knowledge, which is used to
process input and also to produce thoughts (sometimes externalized). Seems also to be modality independent. And
their properties look wholly different, so it’s hard to see how one could piggy-back on the other.

we dont teach children to see. they have a visual grammar built in. why wouldnt we expect some mutation
of that system to allow auditory grammar.
