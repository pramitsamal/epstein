Ti v4 Expert Analysis

m Joint returns may be filed, usually as an
amended return with a refund claim,
until the three-year limitations period
(or the two-year payment period, if
later) expires. For individuals who filed
2009 tax returns on or before April
15, 2010, the limitations period for
that year is closed. For those who filed
their 2009 returns on an automatic six-
month extension on October 15, 2010,
however, the limitations period for the
2009 tax year remains open until Oc-
tober 15, 2013. To claim joint return
status on an amended 2009 tax return
under the three-year rule, both married
partners’ original tax returns must have
been filed within that extended period.

m ‘Taxpayers who filed protective refund
claims prior to the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion should be on the alert to any forth-
coming IRS guidelines that may facilitate
the agency's processing of those claims.

m ‘Taxpayers who had a lower combined
overall tax liability filing as unmarried sin-
gle individuals during an open year appear
to be under no obligation now to file an
amended return to file jointly (or as mar-
ried filing separately if at least one partner
does not consent to a joint return).

IRS Audit Policy. Technically, the IRS, on
audit of an open year for which any previ-
ously-filed return by a married, same-sex
partner used unmarried, single-filer status,
may be able to require that tax be recom-
puted based on either a joint return, or mar-
ried filing separately status return. However,
since audits are under IRS’s discretionary
powers, the consensus among at least some
practitioners, is that IRS National Office
may —and more likely will— direct agents
to by-pass any filing-status issues unless the
taxpayer requests a change.

2013 Tax Year. For 2013 returns that will be
filed in 2014, the Supreme Court’s Windsor
decision presumably relates back to the entire
2013 tax year in determining filing status.

COMMENT. Married partners do not have
the option to file short-year returns as un-
married for the January I — June 26, 2013
period, they must file jointly or married fil-
ing separately for the entire 2013 tax year.

2012 Tax Year. Taxpayers who are on exten-
sion until October 15, 2013 for filing their
2012 tax year returns appear to be required
to file those returns either jointly or married
filing separately. Taxpayers who filed their
2012 tax year returns before June 26, 2013,
as separate, unmarried individuals, however,
may not need to change their filing status to
married filing joint if it would be less favor-
able to their overall tax liability. The IRS

may issue guidance on this issue.
