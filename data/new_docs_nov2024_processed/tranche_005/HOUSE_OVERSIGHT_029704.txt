settlements over peace has contributed to
Israel's culture of impunity.

FP: Can America be an effective broker
in negotiations?

SE: If the U.S. decides to be an honest
broker, it could not only be effective but
in fact could bring real peace to the
region, a just and lasting one. The U.S.
has a moral obligation toward the
Palestinian people, who have been under
occupation and living in exile for
decades.

FP: Is a two state solution still possible?

SE: Yes, but only if there is a political
will. So far, Israel's will is about
colonization, and the international
community has failed to put an end to
decades of double standards by treating
Israel as a state above the law. We don't
see any other solution than a two-state
solution, though Israel is taking us to a
one-state reality.
