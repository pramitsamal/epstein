population” at a time when China and the
broad industrialized world is aging.
According to Tharoor, the average age in
China today is around 38, whereas in
India it’s around 28. In 20 years, that gap
will be much larger. So this could be a
huge demographic dividend — “provided
that we can educate our youth — offering
vocational training to some and
university to others to equip them to take
advantage of what the 21st-century global
economy offers,” said Tharoor. “If we get
it right, India becomes the workhorse of
the world. If we get it wrong, there is
nothing worse than unemployable,
frustrated” youth.

Indeed, some of India’s disaffected youth
are turning to Maoism in rural areas. “We
have Maoists among our tribal
populations, who have not benefited from
the opportunities of modern India,”
Tharoor said. There have been violent
Maoist incidents in 165 of India’s 625
districts in recent years, as Maoists tap
into all those left out of the “Indian
dream.” So there is now a huge push here
to lure poor kids into school. India runs
the world’s biggest midday lunch
program, serving 250 million free school
lunches each day. It’s also doubled its
number of Indian Institutes of
Technology, from eight to 16, and is
planning 14 new universities for
innovation and research.
