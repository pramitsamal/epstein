any warning, the next tactic 1s
competitive devaluation, which risks a
new protectionism. Currency
manipulation could become a danger
that reaches far beyond the debate about
Chinese policies. The world economy
will need at some point to withdraw the
drug of cheap money and negative real
interest rates. The U.S. should anticipate
these dangers.

The International Monetary Fund also
could help set standards about exchange-
rate policies and serve as a referee that
blows a whistle, even if it cannot
penalize. The IMF and the World Trade
Organization should anticipate this risk
and give effect to the existing WTO
agreement that economies must avoid
manipulating exchange rates . . . to gain
an unfair competitive advantage.

Third, the U.S. needs to break the logjam
on opening markets. As the leading world
economy, America should initially try to
strengthen and increase international
trade through the WTO. As my
colleagues at the Peterson Institute have
pointed out, there are gains from the
stymied Doha Round of trade
negotiations that should be harvested
now: ending agricultural export
subsidies; limiting food export controls;
eliminating tariffs and quotas for almost
all exports of the poorest countries;
facilitating customs and clearance
