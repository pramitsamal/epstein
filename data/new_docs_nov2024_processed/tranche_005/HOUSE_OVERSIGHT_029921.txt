About Diana DeGette

Chief Deputy Whip Diana DeGette is a 8th term member of Congress, representing
Colorado’s 1st Congressional district. In her eight terms serving the Denver metro region,
Diana has established herself as a leader for progressive change on health care,
reproductive rights, food safety, consumer protection and the environment.

DeGette is the most senior legislator in Colorado’s House delegation, and in the 111th
Congress she held a large amount of power as the House Democratic chief deputy whip and
the vice chair of the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee.

With the Republicans taking control of the House in 2010, DeGette lost her vice chair
position, but she is still a chief deputy whip and the ranking member of the Energy and
Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

In January, 2011, Rep. DeGette was elected the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations.

DeGette is best known for championing increased federal funding for stem-cell research. In
2006, the congresswoman pushed President George W. Bush to issue the very first veto of
his presidency when she teamed up with then-Rep. Mike Castle (R-Del.) to pass the Stem
Cell Research Enhancement Act through a GOP-controlled Congress.

In summer 2008, DeGette published Sex, Science, and Stem Cells: Inside the Right Assault
on Reason, a book that condemns the politicization of science and argues that legislation

on issues like abortion, birth control and funding for education programs should be based
on science rather than religion. Too many of our elected officials are simply incapable of

thinking rationally about sex, she writes.

Diana is married to attorney Lino Lipinsky. They have two daughters and a dog.
