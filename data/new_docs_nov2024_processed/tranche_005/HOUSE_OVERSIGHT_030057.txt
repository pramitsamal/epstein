Norway to Jews: You're Not Welcome

Here
Alan M. Dershowitz

MARCH 29, 2011 -- I recently completed a tour of Norwegian
universities, where I spoke about international law as applied to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the tour nearly never happened.

Its sponsor, a Norwegian pro-Israel group, offered to have me lecture
without any charge to the three major universities. Norwegian
universities generally jump at any opportunity to invite lecturers from
elsewhere. When my Harvard colleague Stephen Walt, co-author of
The Israel Lobby, came to Norway, he was immediately invited to
present a lecture at the Norwegian University of Science and
Technology in Trondheim. Likewise with Ilan Pappe, a demonizer of
Israel who teaches at Oxford.

My hosts expected, therefore, that their offer to have me present a
different academic perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
would be eagerly accepted. I have written half a dozen books on the
subject presenting a centrist view in support of the two-state solution.
But the universities refused.

The dean of the law faculty at Bergen University said he would be
honored to have me present a lecture on the O.J. Simpson case, as
long as I was willing to promise not to mention Israel. An
administrator at the Trondheim school said that Israel was too
controversial.

The University of Oslo simply said no without offering an excuse.
That led one journalist to wonder whether the Norwegian universities
believe that I am not entirely house-trained.
