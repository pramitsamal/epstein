An examination of the political reforms conducted by successive
governments in Jordan over the last decade suggests that, in most
cases, the king’s directives were ignored, diluted, and, at times,
directly opposed. This does not imply that the objectives of this class
and the monarch were always in contradiction, but suggests that the
rentier system has, over time and through entrenchment, created
monsters who will only acquiesce as long as the system perpetuates
the old policy of favors.

These groups are therefore more likely to pursue policies that are
antithetical to political reform, thus resulting in the gaps and
imbalances lamented by the king’s latest letter. These rentier systems
have already proven to be difficult to maintain and, in an Arab world
that is increasingly demanding better governance and greater
accountability, such ossified systems will come to pose significant
threats to stability, particularly in resource-poor countries such as
Jordan

Conclusion

After a decade of political reform efforts in Jordan, it does not appear
that the process has made any significant advances. In fact, as is clear
from some of the key indicators above, the process seems not only to
have stalled, but regressed as well. Reversals in civil liberties and
political rights caused Jordan to lose significant international
standing. In the annual Freedom House rankings, Jordan declined
from a rank of 4 in 2001 (partly free) on a scale of 1 to 7 (1 being
most free) to a rank of 6 (not free) in 2010. Corruption has also
become a major issue in the country in the last few years. From 2003
to 2007, the Jordanian Center for Strategic Studies asked citizens in
its annual poll to rate their priorities for the country. Over the four
year period, they consistently ranked corruption among their top
priorities; it came in a close second to poverty and unemployment.
