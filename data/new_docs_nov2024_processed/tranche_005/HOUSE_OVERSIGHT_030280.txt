of defense. Even worse, he personally still controls the two jobs in a
caretaker capacity, and seems in no hurry to give them up any time
soon.

On Tuesday, Allawi nominated two people for the Defense Ministry,
ex-army officers Nouri al-Duleimy and Abdul-Mayjid Abdul Latif, but
neither of them to date has been accepted by the prime minister. At a
recent press conference, Maliki accused his rival of sectarianism and
of breaching an agreement between them, hammered out last
November.

Then, Allawi sluggishly agreed to accept Maliki as premier, although
the latter controlled only 89 out of 325 seats in parliament whereas
Allawi's secular National Iraqi List commanded a slim majority of 91
seats. Instead, Allawi would be given a new job, which rivals, and in
some cases theoretically challenges, that of the prime minister -
chairman of the National Council for Strategic Policies (NCSP). That
post, six months down the road, is still nowhere close to being
formed. Allawi complains that his coalition is being treated not as a
partner but as a participant in the Maliki government.

Allawi accepted the novel post with a grain of salt. It took heavy
lobbying by Saudi Arabia, and a phone call from US President
Barack Obama, to convince him to settle for the NCSP, along with
assurances that the body would have real powers, rather than
ceremonial duties.

The new council was supposed to operate under the umbrella of the
Iraqi executive branch and replace the National Security Council,
mandated to monitor government ministers and make sure that they
carry out their duties according to the constitution. Additionally, the
council was supposed to have several branches: (domestic) political
affairs, foreign policy, economic and monetary affairs, security and
military affairs, energy, oil and gas, electricity, water and
environmental affairs.
