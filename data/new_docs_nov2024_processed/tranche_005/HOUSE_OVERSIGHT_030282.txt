Allawi's Iragiya bloc, or whether different parties, or sects, would
rotate within its leadership in future years.

Iraqis need to decide whether the council's leader will always be a
Shi'ite, given that Allawi is Shi'ite, or whether Sunnis, Kurds and
Christians will be entitled to compete for the post. If the new council
will have powers equal to that of the prime minister, will it become
part of the sectarian division of power in Iraq? Will it become a
permanent seat that is given to the second runner up in any
parliamentary election? And what will its status become if Allawi
becomes prime minister one day?

Would it stay with Allawi's team or will it go to the defeated
coalition in parliament? If this is the case, it needs to be said, either in
writing or gentleman's agreement; especially that in today's case,
Allawi's team is not a minority in parliament, but actually, the
coalition with the largest number of seats.
