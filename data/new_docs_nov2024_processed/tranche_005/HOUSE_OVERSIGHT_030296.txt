Tam back on line now.

I see the statement didn't go. Monday? Maybe tomorrow?

I will speak to Jeffery Epstein's lawyer but JE has a conflict with you and will want your silence as whilst you
are being attacked there is less heat on him.

Either is lying or not. If we let her lie without challenge then the lies become the reality and
that may lead to you facing investigation. These are serious allegations and In the UK prosecuting people who
face allegations of sex abuse is now common place and a lot of resources are focused on this.

We can't sit back and let you be a conspirator by silence.

Your are not guilty and must follow Dershowtiz line. He is a leading lawyer and he hasn't followed the don't say
anything for fear of litigation. He has rightly called Pe biutt and shouted his innocence.

You have to stand up and deny the allegations or be branded guilty by association and that may lead to other
investigations and worse.

I feel I am going around in circles.

I know what is right to do and that is to shout your innocence.
Try and get some rest. Call me tomorrow if you want anytime.
Speak to Deshowitz.

Don't allay yourself to JE as that is not the way to go.

Best

Philip
