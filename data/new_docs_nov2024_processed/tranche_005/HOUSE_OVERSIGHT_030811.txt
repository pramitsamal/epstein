Twilight of the Gods part 3: Why is everyone assuming that the next Chinese tightening is the last one?
Every time China tightened monetary policy this year, most China research maintained that the tightening cycle is close to its

end. Perhaps; Premier Wen has stated that the country’s efforts to control inflation have worked, that price stability is in an
acceptable range, and that it will drop steadily from here. But last week’s headline inflation release of 6.4% hit a three year
high, and it is not clear to us that China is about to end its various inflation control policy measures.

In favor of Wen’s argument, food inflation has been a large contributor, some of which should be transitory. Blue-ear pig virus
(PRRS) killed hundreds of thousands of pigs in 2010, which affected this year’s supply (2006 was worse). As shown below,
pork prices have soared, but should come down if the supply situation normalizes. [Note: a “Strategic Pork Reserve” can be
released to mitigate price increases]. However, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization’, new virulent strains of
the virus have a fatality rate of 20% (even higher for piglets), and what is considered a temporary supply shock may be more
permanent. Chinese pig facilities have the highest animal densities in the world, contributing to the spread of disease to 25 of
China’s 33 provinces. Antibiotics have proven ineffective, and once one pig gets the disease, it tends to spread to the entire
herd in 7-10 days. China has vaccinated 100 million of its 500 million pigs, but existing vaccines do not prevent infection, they
only slow the rate of transmission to other pigs.

A separate issue is that China is doing a lot more to control the supply of money than the cost of money. As shown below, there
have been a lot more increases in bank reserve requirements than interest rate increases. Deposit rates are still negative in real
terms, and bank reserve requirements only affect banks, and not the shadow banking system, which is growing in China.

Forward-looking manufacturing surveys have declined and interbank lending rates (Shibor) have surged, so it’s clear that the
tightening steps are working. But private sector credit is still growing in China, and real estate prices are still nsing. The
bottom line is that the substantial stimulus provided by Chinese and other Asian policymakers in the wake of the
recession has not yet been adequately withdrawn, and that more steps will need to be taken to do so.
