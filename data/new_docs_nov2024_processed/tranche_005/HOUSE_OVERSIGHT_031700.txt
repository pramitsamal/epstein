“The most charitable way of explaining the election results of 2012 is that Americans voted
for the status quo - for the incumbent President and for a divided Congress. They must enjoy
gridlock, partisanship, incompetence, economic stagnation and avoidance of responsibility.
And fewer people voted.

But as we awake from the nightmare, it is important to eschew the facile explanations for the
Romney defeat that will prevail among the chattering classes. Romney did not lose because
of the effects of Hurricane Sandy that devastated this area, nor did he lose because he ran a
poor campaign, nor did he lose because the Republicans could have chosen better
candidates, nor did he lose because Obama benefited from a slight uptick in the economy
due to the business cycle.

Romney lost because he didn't get enough votes to win.

That might seem obvious, but not for the obvious reasons. Romney lost because the
conservative virtues - the traditional American virtues — of liberty, hard work, free enterprise,
private initiative and aspirations to moral greatness - no longer inspire or animate a majority
of the electorate.

The simplest reason why Romney lost was because it is impossible to compete against free
stuff.
