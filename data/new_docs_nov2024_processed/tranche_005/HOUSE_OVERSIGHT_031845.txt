Amid the Arab Spring, a U.S.-Saudi split
Nawaf Obaid

May 16 - RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA -- A tectonic shift has
occurred in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Despite significant pressure
from the Obama administration to remain on the sidelines, Saudi
leaders sent troops into Manama in March to defend Bahrain’s
monarchy and quell the unrest that has shaken that country since
February. For more than 60 years, Saudi Arabia has been bound by
an unwritten bargain: oil for security. Riyadh has often protested but
ultimately acquiesced to what it saw as misguided U.S. policies. But
American missteps in the region since Sept. 11, an ill-conceived
response to the Arab protest movements and an unconscionable
refusal to hold Israel accountable for its illegal settlement building
have brought this arrangement to an end. As the Saudis recalibrate
the partnership, Riyadh intends to pursue a much more assertive
foreign policy, at times conflicting with American interests. The
backdrop for this change are the rise of Iranian meddling in the
region and the counterproductive policies that the United States has
pursued here since Sept. 11. The most significant blunder may have
been the invasion of Iraq, which resulted in enormous loss of life and
provided Iran an opening to expand its sphere of influence. For years,
Iran’s leadership has aimed to foment discord while furthering its
geopolitical ambitions. Tehran has long funded Hamas and
Hezbollah; recently, its scope of attempted interference has
broadened to include the affairs of Arab states from Yemen to
Morocco. This month the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, Gen.
Hasan Firouzabadi, harshly criticized Riyadh over its intervention in
Bahrain, claiming this act would spark massive domestic uprisings.
