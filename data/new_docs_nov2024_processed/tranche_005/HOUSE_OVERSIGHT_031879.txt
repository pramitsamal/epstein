ideological distance between the Muslim world and the West in
general would widen — and opportunities for friendship and
cooperation between the two could vanish.” This from our ally, not to
mention friendly gas station.

The tone of the column is both remarkable and ominous. It comes, as
I said, from a man of little charm, but he is nevertheless a skilled
diplomat and intelligence chief. While his vexation over the
Palestinian problem is well-known, rarely has it been carried to this
extent — and in such a public venue.

A Post opinion column is designed to get the attention of the
American government. I’m sure Prince Turki succeeded in that. But I
hope he also got the attention of the Israeli government, which for
some time now has enjoyed Saudi moderation on the Palestinian
question. That seems about to change — not the least because the
Arab street that Turki expressly mentioned is demanding it and the
Saudis will, if they have to, appease the street. This is the gravamen
of Prince Turki’s piece and is why he ends it so ominously for Israel:
“I’d hate to be around when they face their comeuppance.”
