Saudi Arabia is a regional power with vested interests in the country,
and Russia and Syria enjoy historical relations, as well as arms deals.
It is these countries that now must be on the front lines of reform,
with the US largely working behind the scenes.

For the west, the most powerful and poignant moment in recent
months came when US ambassador Robert Ford travelled to Hama,
scene of protests, to show solidarity and monitor the regime’s actions.
His quiet move warmed usually hostile Sunni communities elsewhere
in the Middle East to America, while putting fear into the heart of the
tyrant himself. Such innovative, soft power strategies will do more to
help Syrian democracy than loud statements from the White House.
The most powerful pressure on Mr Assad so far, however, has been
from Al Jazeera’s Arabic coverage, which encouraged Syrians to take
control of their own destiny. This is surely right, for any long-term
change must come from within. Sadly, in the short term and in a
highly volatile region, at present Mr Assad remains the least worst
option.
