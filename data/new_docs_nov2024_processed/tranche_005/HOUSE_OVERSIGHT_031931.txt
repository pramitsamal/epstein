Nobody and no amount of external assistance can help the Syrian
protesters overcome their differences (as a Lebanese citizen, trust me
on this one). But the sooner they speak with one voice, organize their
ranks from within, and show the world that they are a mature and
capable group able to turn Syria into a responsible democracy, the
closer they will be to fulfilling their dream of toppling the Assad
regime.

Their unity and organization are indeed more powerful than NATO’s
bombs and more effective than the West’s sanctions. The lessons of
Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia are clear: With unity comes historic
opportunity.
