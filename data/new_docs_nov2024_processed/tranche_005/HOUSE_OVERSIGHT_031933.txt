So despite their many faults and deplorable record on human rights,
the Assads have treated their chemical arsenal with considerable care.
But as the country potentially descends into chaos, will that hold
true?

Let's start with the possibility of civil war. According to researchers
at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, open
sources indicate that there are at least four, and potentially five,
chemical weapons production facilities in Syria. One or two are
located near Damascus, the other three situated in Hama, Latakia, and
al-Safira village, near the city of Aleppo. Hama is one of the hotbeds
of the Syrian revolt, which Assad's tanks attacked in early August and
where, more recently, fighting has severely damaged the city's
hospitals. Latakia is another center of unrest; it was shelled by the
Syrian Navy in mid-August. Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city has
also seen significant demonstrations.

If anti-Assad insurgents take up arms, the chemical sites, as symbols
of regime's authority, could become strategic targets. And, if mass
defections occur from the Syrian army, there may be no one left to
defend the sites against seizure. This could lead to disastrous
outcomes -- including confiscation of the chemical weapons by a
radical new national government, or sale of the weapons as war booty
to organized non-state actors or criminal groups.

In such chaos, no one can predict who might control the weapons or
where they might be taken. With these chemical weapons in the
hands of those engaged in a possible civil war, the risks that they
would be used would increase substantially. The problem would be
worsened further if some possessors were not fully aware of the
extent of the weapons' deadly effects.

And let's imagine that Assad is eventually removed: What leaders
would gain control of these weapons after he departed? Saudi-backed
Sunni groups? Iran-backed Shia organizations? Whoever they might
