Hi Jeffrey! !

Thank you for writing. I'm doing well. Looking forward for winter season in the Alps!

I have MR from Zurich as assistant for you. I sent you her photos once :) MMMM dives in New Jersey
now and J in paris!!

I have some new ones here in zurich but not in NY or Paris yet.

How is it going with Zubair?

Do you believe Trump will win or Hilary ?

I miss Berkeley so much. This California lifestyle was magical. Can't wait to be back for 2nd semester ©

I plan to pass NY or California bar and be attorney in USA. I love America and the Win mentality in your
country.

Kind regards,
