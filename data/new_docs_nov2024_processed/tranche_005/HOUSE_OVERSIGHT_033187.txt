You are a prophet...

I was just with senior leaders in Beijing...

I’11 be discussing China-U.S. relations under “President Trump” with the former Chinese Ambassador to the
U.S on CCTV News (“Closer To China”), broadcast in China and internationally (NY - “CCTV News” channel) -
Saturday at 8:30 pm and Sunday at 8:30 am New York time. Not an interview - we will each question each
other.

we’re playing in new territory here. There may be some contributions we can make.. To be discussed
privately. I return to Los Angeles on Nov. 17, but dont get to NY until Dec. 24, after my next trip to
Beijing.
