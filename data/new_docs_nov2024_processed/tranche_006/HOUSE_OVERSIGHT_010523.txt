CHAPTER 48

Michael Reiter: July 2006

n July 28, the grand jury reached a verdict that floored
the Palm Beach PD.
The original plea deal that Krischer had offered to
Epstein had been bad enough. Now the grand jury was recom-
mending that Epstein be charged with just one felony count of
solicitation of prostitution.
There was no mention of underage girls. The original
accusation —four felony counts of unlawful sex acts with minors
and one felony count of lewd and lascivious molestation — had

simply evaporated.
It wasn’t enough to send Epstein to prison.

Epstein was allowed to surrender on a Sunday, when no one ~ j
would know he'd been arraigned. A few hours later, he was a

released on three thousand dollars bail.
The Palm Beach PD was not even notified.
