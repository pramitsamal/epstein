Q. Okay. So you now are withdrawing the
statement that you made that Virginia Roberts said
that Bill Clinton was with her at an orgy on
Jeffrey's island; that was wrong?

A. 1 don't know whether she ever said that.

I would not repeat that statement and have not
repeated that statement based on her denial. As
soon as she denied it, | never again made that
statement and would not again make that statement.

Q. You —-

A. But I did reiterate the fact that she
committed perjury when she said she was on the
island with Bill Clinton.

MR. SCAROLA: Move to strike the
nonresponsive --

A. That was the perjurious statement.

MR. SCAROLA: Move to strike the
nonresponsive portions of the answer.

Your client is doing everything he can to avoid
giving direct answers to these questions.

I would appreciate it if you would take a
break, counsel your client that the speeches
are not helpful to anyone, and especially not
helpful to him.

MR. SCOTT: If you want to take a break,
I'll take a break and I will advise my client
whatever I feel is appropriate, not what you
instruct me to do.

MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Well, if you think it
might help at all in the progress of this
deposition, then I do want to take a break. If
you don't think taking a break would be
helpful, I don't want to take a break.

MR. SCOTT: Do you want to take a break or
not?

THE WITNESS: I'm going to leave it to
your judgment. I'm happy to proceed --

MR. SCOTT: Okay. I'll be glad to take a
break.

MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.

MR. SCOTT: | can't say --

MR. SCAROLA: Five minutes.

MR. SCOTT: -- it will help you or

committed a crime and legal -- some kind of
proceedings resulted from her committing a crime.
The crime she committed was stealing money from a
restaurant that she worked at while she was also
working for Jeffrey Epstein. And it was my
information that there was a criminal record of her
theft.
Q. How old was she at the time this alleged
offense occurred?
A. Idon't know. But old enough to be held
criminally responsible in the State of Florida, to
my knowledge. To my knowledge, | -- I recall a case
where a 14-year-old boy was sentenced as an adult
for --
MR. SCAROLA: Mr. Scott --
A, -- a Serious ~~
MR. SCAROLA: -- did my question ask
anything about a 14-year-old boy?
A. Youasked if --
MR. SCAROLA: Do we really need to listen
to this?
MR. SCOTT: You're asking questions, my
client is providing his response.
MR. SCAROLA: No, your client is not
responding. Your client is filibustering.

anything but --

MR. SCAROLA: I can understand that you
don't -- you don’t have that control, but if
there's any reasonable --

MR. SCOTT: You know, Counsel --

MR. SCAROLA: -- prospect that it might
help, let's give it a try.

MR. SCOTT: You know, I really don't
appreciate the comments about my abilities as
an attorney, like | don't have that control and
things of nature. It really is --

MR. SCAROLA: I don't have the control
either.

MR. SCOTT: It's not --

MR. SCAROLA: I'm not trying to disparage
you at all in any respect. I'm just suggesting
that --

MR. SCOTT: Okay.

MR. SCAROLA: -- there is reason to doubt
that it will do any good. But I want to give
ita try.

MR. SCOTT: Okay. Fine. Thank you.

MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.
