Quesnay’s Idea

What Quesnay wrote, in his entry for “man” in Diderot’s Encyclopedia of 1750, was

“Those who make manufactured commodities do not produce wealth...they
spend their receipts in order to obtain their subsistence. Thus they consume

argument was that value is added in agriculture alone, not in manufactures. His
conclusion that only landowners can afford to pay taxes did not enchant the landed

aristocracy of Versailles.

become capable of productive industry.”

Mill’s Principles of 1848, which I quoted earlier, said the same:

“What they consume in keeping up their health, strength and capacities of
work, or in rearing the productive laborers to succeed them, is productive
consumption.”

Sraffa’s parallel idea is expressed in his 1960 paper Production of Commodities by

Means of Commodities.

My impression is that Quesnay’s “surplus of wealth” means value added, and that he
thought maintenance consumption should be deducted from revenue in finding it.
Mill can’t have meant what I think Quesnay did, in view of Mill’s evident belief that

output is investment plus consumption. Rather, when I like Quesnay argued that
