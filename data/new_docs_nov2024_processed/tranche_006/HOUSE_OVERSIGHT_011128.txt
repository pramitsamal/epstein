pure consumption. Why? Output in itself means creation of economic value.
Mathematically, that could include what I called “output exhaust”, meaning value
exhausted as soon as created. | ruled that out as “free goods”, which happen every
day but are neglected in economics as unable to influence behavior either before or
after. That’s why “equals” cannot mean “is” in (A1.3). And neither does it in (A1.5).
Rather both state that output provides cash flow offset plus total capital growth.

This distinction helps everywhere in economics. We know for example that transfer
out may be drawn either from capital in place or from concurrent output. The
source of first kind is decaptialization D. But decaptialization also includes other
components than transfer out. In Chapter 3, and again just now, I excluded output

exhaust as free goods possible in math but neglected in economics. That makes

decapitalization D the only source of pure consumption C, . And not all

decapitalization is transfer or exhaust. Some is deadweight loss, defined in (A1.1) as

any negative sum of capital growth K,, and cash flow F. That can show in

D=D\+D, and D,=D_+C,. (A1.4)

Here D, is recovered or realized decapitalization, D, is “transfer depreciation” net

of plowback into the same asset, and D, is deadweight loss. A is lambda. At the

collective scale, where transfers cancel internally, (A1.4) becomes

D=C., (A1.4a)

The dispositions of transfer out may be reinvestment in other assets of the same
owner, or may be gift to donees. Reinvestment can be interfactor as shown in

Chapter 5. Transfer out from total capital of any individual, net of internal transfers,
