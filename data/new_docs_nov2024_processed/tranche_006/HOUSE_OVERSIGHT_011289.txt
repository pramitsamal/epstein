Challenges of Artificial Intelligence:

Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

e Noconsensus reality, inability to coordinate large-scale positive action
e Concrete version of emergent social failure from Al technology

DISCUSSION

Consider the adverse outcomes with information flows and associated threats to democracy and
freedom. What surprises might lurk in our future around costly outcomes in this realm? How
might we thwart attacks on manipulating content from people, and on harnessing or hacking
someone’s identity? What might be done to thwart a march to adverse outcomes for information,
freedom of thought, democracy? What recommendations might be made about steps for moving
forward?

POTENTIAL GOALS

e Seek a better understanding of the technological, social, political and economic aspects around
uses of Al for generating, optimizing information and propaganda.

e Identify potential blueprints for institutional interventions that may prevent/slow/detect the
scenario unfolding

e Develop ideas for coordinating relevant actors (advertising agencies, political parties) and/or
carriers (media outlets, digital platforms) to prevent the worst versions of the scenario.

e Identify potential approaches to thwarting attacks harnessing identify, including certification of
identity by owners, identifying mechanisms for thwarting generation and distribution of false
content. Possibilities of new approaches to minimizing threat with fines, other regulatory activity.
