going over there? You said you had a baby and you
changed?

A. Yeah.

Q. what happened?

A. Everything changed in my life, everything. I

ended up getting a job and I just stopped. I just

stopped. I don't know.

A. I just stopped because I have a son now and I
didn't feel like it was right. First off, I was a
stay-at-home mommy, okay. And what am I going to do,
bring my son over there to Jeffrey's, no, you know. So I
focused on my son. I had a beautiful baby boy that was
my pride and joy. I didn't care for anything else. I
didn’t care to tell friends. I dropped all my friends.
Like he asked me do I have any numbers, no, you know. If
anybody does call me, that's my mother. Like it was just
me and my baby boy and it's been like that ever since.

BY AGENT RICHARDS:

Q. Having a baby is a life-changing experience,
isn’t it?

A. Having a baby?

Q. Yes, it's full-time.
