Note, the latter is given as an extensional equivalence because it’s a pure mathematical equiv-
alence. This is not the only case of pure extensional equivalence, but it’s an important one.

13.3.4 Temporal Links

There are also temporal versions of these links, such as

PredictiveImplicationLink
PredictiveAttractionLink
SequentialANDLink
SimultaneousANDLink

which combine logical relation between the argument with temporal relation between their
arguments. For instance, we might say
PredictivelImplicationLink

PredicateNode: Jumpoffcliff
PredicateNode: Dead

or including arguments,

PredictiveImplicationLink
EvaluationLink JumpOffCliff $x
EvaluationLink Dead $X

The former version, without variable arguments given, shows the possibility of using higher-
order logical links to join predicates without any explicit variables. Via using this format exclu-
sively, one could avoid VariableAtoms entirely, using only higher-order functions in the manner
