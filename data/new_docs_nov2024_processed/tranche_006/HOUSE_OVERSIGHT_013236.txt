Fig. 18.1: Representation of PLN Deduction Rule as Cognitive Content. Top: the
current, hard-coded representation of the deduction rule. Bottom: representation of the same
rule in the Atomspace as cognitive content, susceptible to analysis and improvement by the
system’s own cognitive processes.

Furthermore, we suspect that the internal representation of programs used for supercompila-
tion is highly relevant for other kinds of self-modification as well. Supercompilation requires one
kind of reasoning on complex programs, and goal-directed program creation requires another,
but both, we conjecture, can benefit from the same way of looking at programs.
