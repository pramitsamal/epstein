particular case could have been resolved in that very case rather than now re-litigated in satellite

: Bs Edwards is Entitled to Summary Judgment on the Claim of
Abuse of Process Because He Acted Properly Within the Boundaries of the
Law in Pursuit of the Legitimate Interests of his Clients.

Epstein’s Second Amended Complaint raises several claims of “abuse of process.” An
abuse of process claim requires proof of three elements: “(1) that the defendant made an illegal,
improper, or perverted use of process; (2) that the defendant had ulterior mative or purposes in
exercising such illegal, improper, or perverted use of process; and (3) that, as a result of such
action on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff suffered damage.” S & I Investments v. Payless
Flea Market, Inc., 36 So.3d 909, 917 (Fla, 4 Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (internal citation omitted), In
fac, this Court is very familiar with this cause of action, as Edwards has correctly stated this
eattae in his counterclaim against Epstein. Edwards is entitled to summary judgment because
Epstein cannot prove these elements.

The first element of an abuse of process claim is that a defendant made “an illegal,
improper, or perverted use of process.” On the surface, Epstein’s Complaint appears to contain
several allegations of such improper process. On examination, however, each of these
allegations amounts to nothing other than a claim that Epstein was unhappy with some
discovery proceeding, motion or argument made by Edwards. This is not the stuff of an abuse of
process claim, particularly where Epstein fails to allege that he was required to do something as
the result of Edwards’ pursuit of the claims against him, See Marty v. Gresh, 501 So.2d 87, 90
(Fla, 1* Dist. Ct. App. 1987) (affirming summary judgment on an abuse of process claim where

“appellant’s lawsuit caused appellee to do nothing against her will”).
