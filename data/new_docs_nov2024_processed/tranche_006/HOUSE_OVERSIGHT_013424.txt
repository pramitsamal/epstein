No Chance I'm going to believe any of this. Jane Does seems
to be the operative phrase in all of this. Do a google search for
Ghislaine Maxwell Vanity Fair you'll find a relatively different,
much more founded story there.

But Hollywood types say raping and drugging 13 year olds isn't
really a crime anymore. Jeffrey and Roman should be released
and given an apology. How dare we have laws to protect
children. Don't they realize these men are FAMOUS?
