CHAPTER 5:

SOME ENTHEOGENIC ENTROPIES

In the spring of 1968, members of my laboratory team were looking for new
brain metabolic pathways of the essential amino acid tryptophan, the dietary
precursor of the human mood, sleep and libidinal neurotransmitter, serotonin. After
struggling for several months to identify an apparently new compound, which turned
out not to be new but only new in the brain, we collected evidence for a human
brain enzyme that could catalyze the production of an LSD-like hallucinogen,
dimethyltryptamine, DMT. Tracing its metabolic origins, we found that DMT was
derived from tryptamine, a common metabolite of the essential and omnipresent
amino acid, tryptophan. This enzyme and its metabolic product were located in
highest concentrations in brain stem systems that influence the neural regulation of
the heart, blood pressure, temperature, breathing, vomiting and primitive approach-
avoidance behavior. It was also found in limbic brain nuclei thought to modulate the
emotional coloring of perception and thought. Richard Wyatt, working at the
National Institutes of Mental Health found DMT in the urine of schizophrenic
humans. He also showed that DMT increased significantly if tryptamine’s normal

pathway for degradation was blocked by monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as
