»> PREFACE TO THE EXPANDED AND
UPDATED EDITION

Tie 4-Hour Workweek was turned down by 26 out of 27 publishers.

After it was sold, the president of one potential marketing partner, a large bookseller, e-mailed me
historical bestseller statistics to make it clear—this wouldn’t be a mainstream success.

So I did all I knew how to do. I wrote it with two of my closest friends in mind, speaking directly to
them and their problems—problems I long had—and I focused on the unusual options that had worked
for me around the world.

I certainly tried to set conditions for making a sleeper hit possible, but I knew it wasn’t likely. I hoped
for the best and planned for the worst.

May 2, 2007, I receive a call on my cell phone from my editor.
“Tim, you hit the list.”

It was just past 5 P.M. in New York City, and I was exhausted. The book had launched five days
before, and I had just finished a series of more than twenty radio interviews in succession, beginning at 6
A.M. that morning. I never planned a book tour, preferring instead to “batch” radio satellite tours into 48
hours.

“Heather, I love you, but please don’t $4%* with me.”
“No, you really hit the list. Congratulations, Mr. New York Times bestselling author!”
