and projects, outsources all operations entirely, and travels the
world collecting rare documents, all while working remotely on a

establish an online video rental service that delivers $5,000 per
month in income from a small niche of Blu-ray aficionados, a
two-hour-per-week side project that allows him to work full-time
as an animal rights lobbyist.

The options are limitless, but each path begins with the same first step: replacing assumptions.

To join the movement, you will need to learn a new lexicon and recalibrate direction using a compass
for an unusual world. From inverting responsibility to jettisoning the entire concept of “success,” we

TURIN, ITALY

Civilization had too many rules for me, so I did my best to rewrite them.
— BILL COSBY

A, he rotated 360 degrees through the air, the deafening noise turned to silence. Dale Begg-Smith

executed the backflip perfectly —skis crossed in an X over his head—and landed in the record books as
he slid across the finish.

It was February 16, 2006, and he was now a mogul-skiing gold medalist at the Turin Winter
Olympics. Unlike other full-time athletes, he will never have to return to a dead-end job after his
moment of glory, nor will he look back at this day as the climax of his only passion. After all, he was
only 21 years old and drove a black Lamborghini.

Born a Canadian and something of a late bloomer, Dale found his calling, an Internet-based IT
company, at the age of 13. Fortunately, he had a more-experienced mentor and partner to guide him: his
15-year-old brother, Jason. Created to fund their dreams of standing atop the Olympic podium, it would,
only two years later, become the third-largest company of its kind in the world.
