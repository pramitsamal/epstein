S ome jobs are simply beyond repair.

Improvements would be like adding a set of designer curtains to a jail cell: better but far from good. In
the context of this chapter, “job” will refer to both a company if you run one and a normal job if you
have one. Some recommendations are limited to one of the two but most are relevant to both. So we

I have quit three jobs and been fired from most of the rest. Getting fired, despite sometimes coming as
a surprise and leaving you scrambling to recover, is often a godsend: Someone else makes the decision
for you, and it’s impossible to sit in the wrong job for the rest of your life. Most people aren’t lucky
enough to get fired and die a slow spiritual death over 30-40 years of tolerating the mediocre.
