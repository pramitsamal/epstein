The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our $110 PO
and assign a 1.4x multiple to 2017E TBV and 14x multiple on 2017E EPS, in line with
target multiples for the median large regional banks under coverage. We have weighted
the P/E and P/TBV factors equally at 40%, and our DCF analysis by 20%.

A superior profitability profile suggests an above peer multiple - however, a challenging
macro backdrop and specific industry headwinds restrain our P/E target. Our DCF
assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 9.6% and 11.2% and a terminal growth rate of
4%,

Risks are macro risks such as a lower for longer rate environment, the implementation
of a strict liquidity coverage ratio and further regulation on overdraft income that
restricts bank profitability.

U.S. Bancorp (USB)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF} to arrive at our $50 PO,
assigning an above peer 2.8x multiple to 2017E TBV and near median 14.5x multiple on
2017E EPS due to their above median profitability. We have weighted the P/E and
P/TBV factors equally at 40%, and our DCF analysis by 20%. Our DCF assumes a two-
stage cost of capital of 9.5% and 10.9% and a terminal growth rate of 5%.

Risks to our price objective are macro risks such as a double dip recession, the
implementation of a strict liquidity coverage ratio and further regulation on overdraft
income that restricts bank profitability. Specific to USB, risks are enhanced regulatory
scrutiny and capital standards as a Domestic SIFIl and an announcement of a large
expensive deal that could weigh on the stock price.

UMB Financial Corporation (UMBF)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $78 price
objective and assign a 1.8x multiple to our 2Q17E TBY, in-line with peers, and we place
a 18x multiple on our 2017E EPS, above peers given our above median EPS growth
forecast. Our DCF model assumes cost of equity of 8% and a terminal growth rate of
4%,

Downside risks to our price objective are continued rising long rates, which could
negatively impact the company's sizable securities book and erode tangible book value.
In addition, a sudden outflow of deposits could impact EPS and the asset sensitivity of
UMBF's balance sheet to higher interest rates. Upside risks to our price objective are a
much faster asset mix change into higher yielding loans that significantly increases its
net interest margin.

Wells Fargo & Company (WFC)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF} to arrive at our $55 PO,
assigning a 1.75x multiple to 2017E TBV and 13x multiple on 2017E EPS. We have
weighted the P/E and P/TBV factors equally at 40%, and our DCF analysis by 20%.

Our 1.6x TBV multiple represents a 0.3x premium to our mega-cap median multiple, but
we believe this is justified due to WFC's superior returns on tangible equity (ROTE
consistent between 13%-14% throughout our forecast period, versus 12% for peers).
Our 12x EPS multiple is in line with our mega-cap median multiple. We believe WFC
deserves to trade at a premium due to better earnings growth, but we are assuming
WFC trades in line with peers due to a higher percentage of earnings from mortgage
banking and accretable yield, as well as potentially greater regulatory scrutiny as the
second largest US depository. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 11% and
a terminal growth rate of 4%.
