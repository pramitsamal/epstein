Risks: Geopolitics, diplomacy and US economic cycle

The biggest risk to our scenario is the implications for Japan’s diplomatic and
geopolitical environment of the Donald Trump presidency in the US. The likelihood of
agreement on the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) has already declined and been priced
into the market, but any downward spiral in Japan-US relations would likely be further
negative for Japan equities near-term. A rise in protectionism would be negative for
stocks with high US export exposure. Meanwhile if the US economy slows or enters
recession and the protectionist response weakens USD, it would be negative for
Japanese cyclicals, particularly exporters, due to stronger JPY and potential trade
conflicts. Moreover, a potential improvement in US-Russia (US-China) relations under
the new US President most likely implies a relative worsening in Japan-Russia (Japan-
China) relations. On the other hand, we expect Japan to move closer to Europe under
such a scenario, raising the incentive to sign the Japan-EU EPA (Economic Partner
Agreement), positive for related stocks. If the Trump presidency tips the US towards
isolationism, we expect Japan’s spending on defense to increase. If this results in higher
spending on Japan’s Self Defense Forces (rather than compensating for US spending on
Japan-based US military), Japan’s defense-related stocks would be beneficiaries, and it
could reshape the arms industry in Japan.
