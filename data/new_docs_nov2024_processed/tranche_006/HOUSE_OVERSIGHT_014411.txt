Escape from zero

The Q3 CY16 GDP print confirms our view that Japan has at last emerged from the de
facto zero-growth trap of the past few years. Growth accelerated to an above-
consensus 2.2% q-o-q Saar, after a 0.7% rise in Q2 CY16 and 2.1% rise in Q1 CY16. We
expect a moderation in Q4 CY16, but underlying growth will remain firmly in the 1.0-
1.5% range. We are currently tracking CY2016 growth of 0.7%, a modest improvement
from 0.6% in CY2015, though the switch to a new GDP standard’ next month raises
uncertainty around our forecasts.

Upturn in exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17

The recent recovery has been driven by a fading consumption tax shock and stronger
exports. The downturn in the global industrial cycle in 2014-16 hurt Japan, but
manufacturing activity bottomed out early this year and is now modestly expanding
(Chart 2). The OECD leading indicator continues to signal a synchronized pick-up in
global growth (Chart 3). The domestic inventory cycle also points to production gains
ahead (Chart 4). For Japanese exporters, the improvement in demand has been most
visible for Europe (Chart 5). US and Chinese demand will likely follow, though the
mainland’s structural shift to services implies only a modest acceleration. We expect the
current up-cycle in global exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17 — possibly longer
depending on developments in the US (more on this later). The combination of stronger
external demand and a weaker currency should shore up business confidence, especially
among manufacturers, and lay the foundations of Japan’s recovery.
