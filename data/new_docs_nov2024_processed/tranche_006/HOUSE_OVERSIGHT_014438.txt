Peak globalization/inequality means higher real rates - short 10Y US real rates
Our fixed income team make the point that globalization has been a driving force behind
lower real rates as it has been good for EM growth and reserves. Those reserves then
found their way back into the US holding real rates lower. They argue that as the global
savings glut unwinds real rates have room to re-price. Peak inequality also means an
unwind of globalization as politicians seek to protect workers from the depressing
effect on wages coming from overseas. Donald Trump has already said he intends to
charge China with being a currency manipulator. Whether he does or not and what
action he takes to accompany it remains to be seen, but artificially low currencies
generating high current account surpluses are unlikely to go down well with the new
administration. That lends weight to the fixed income team’s arguments.

Peak inequality may also mean less migration across the world — think Trump’s
arguments on illegal immigration from Mexico and Theresa May’s desire to limit
migration into the UK post Brexit. Less migration likely means more upward pressure on
wages, which is the inflation expectations side of the argument. But Michael Hartnett
also thinks it means more action on fiscal policy. The UK government have implemented
a £24bn infrastructure fund in the Autumn statement. Donald Trump wants to trigger up
to $1tn of infrastructure spending in the US in addition to the tax cuts.

The fiscal boost should push real rates higher (at least in the short term). Some Fed
members have acknowledged this suggesting that equilibrium interest rate might be
moved higher by fiscal stimulus. The rates team also rightly says while they want to be
bearish rates given the speed of the move so far it is also right not to be foolish. Given
how much inflation expectations have moved they think there is better risk reward in
real rates. They argue the 10Y real rate is the most vulnerable to further moves higher in
rates. Although they have already risen from around zero in the summer to ~50bp now
they think 10Y real rates can reach 1%. So we add that trade to our 2-5-10s position.

Implications for other asset classes: Stronger USD, weaker EM?

The forces impacting on markets from the Trump victory have not been confined to
rates markets, although it is probably fair to say that most (although certainly not all) of
the impact stems from the move in rates. Higher US rates have meant a stronger USD,
an outperformance of short duration over long duration equities, a hit to EM debt and all
forms of carry trades.
