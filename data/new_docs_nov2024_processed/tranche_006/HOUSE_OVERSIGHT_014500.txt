Work stoppage threat gets Waste Management to table

By JONATHAN AUSTIN
Daily News Staff

A Waste Management Authority
contractor had planned a work stop-
page this week because the Virgin Is-
lands Waste Management Authority
owes vendors a lot of money and they
can’t keep working for nothing.

However, discussions with adminis-
trators at Waste Management led Peter
Caproni, owner of Your Environmental
Services Inc., to say he’s holding off on
urging garbage collection vendors to
stop work on Wednesday.

“T’m not intent on messing up our
communities,” said Caproni, whose
company picks up the bin sites on St.
John.

“We've created a dialogue. I am
a fair person,’ Caproni said. “I want
to listen to what they have to say. It
seems as though they’re going to put
together an offer.”

Caproni had told The Daily News
on Monday he was announcing a
work stoppage beginning Wednesday.
He said he and other haulers were go-
ing to stop emptying scores of bins
across St. Thomas and St. John be-
cause Waste Management had failed
to pay them for weeks or months.

Caproni said he has worked 26
years in trash removal and roll on/

roll off services in the territory. He
said his company empties “all the
rear load bins on St. John,’ and does
emergency Waste Management Au-
thority work on St. Thomas.

Contacted by The Daily News,
Waste Management Authority execu-
tives were unaware Caproni and pos-
sibly two other haulers were walking
off the job.

Roger Merritt Jr., the newly hired
executive director of the agency, said
Monday evening he wants to meet
with all the contracted haulers to see
what they are owed and come up with
a plan to get them paid.

“T understand that the haulers need
to get paid,” Merritt said. “We need
to ensure we are able to make timely
payments.”

Caproni said he is willing to lis-
ten, but the answer has to be that the
Waste Management Authority comes
up with payment for services already
rendered.

“The solution is, you pay your bills
on time,” he said.

Patrick Charles, one of the vendors
Caproni mentioned, said Monday that
he has “reasons to be on board” with
a work stoppage, though he couldn’t
make such a decision alone.

“T realize that he is upset,’ Charles
said, referring to Caproni. “It is time

Police: Ex-employee filing

By BRIAN O’CONNOR

Police officials dismissed this week
multiple complaints filed by a former
employee against high-ranking mem-
bers of the V.I. Police Department.

The complaints are all filed by
Lynne Harrison, the former director
of the Police Training Bureau.

In one such complaint, Harrison
alleges Deputy Commissioner Curtis
Griffin Jr. was “receiving compensa-
tion when absence from employment
without proper leave documentation,”
and “payroll fraud/embezzlement
— falsifying timekeeping records,
or when employees are not working
while on the job.”

In a letter attached to the claim,
Harrison says that from August 2016
to the present, Griffin received com-
pensation while not reporting for
duty at the department.

“In addition, he has not left for-
warding contact information to those
under his supervision and often was
not available during contact attempts
occurring during normal working
hours,” Harrison wrote. “Griffin was
available only via VIPD email which
was delayed or not deliverable, thus
leaving him ineffective and not suit-
able to be classified as working tele-
commuting.”

Griffin dismissed the complaints

against him, and said he welcomed
an investigation.

“IT want them to investigate be-
cause I’m hoping — when all is done
— I’m hoping that maybe I can sue
her for slander,” he said. “I have noth-
ing to hide.”

Harrison’s letter calls for Griffin to
be investigated.

“While his explanation of absence
has been reported as a long term med-
ical procedure, due to the extraordi-
nary length of absence, previous ab-
sences, and non-contact information,
a full investigation is warranted to in-
sure the people of the Virgin Islands
have not been deprived of its funds
due to improper payroll deductions
or notifications,” she wrote.

The complaint was one of 10 filed
after Harrison lost her job as direc-
tor of the police department’s Train-
ing Bureau, according to copies fur-
nished by Harrison.

She filed a citizen’s complaint after
her termination alleging that Police
Commissioner Delroy Richards Sr.
had violated department policy and
that he had ignored requests for the
correction of a violation.

Harrison also filed a complaint
alleging Griffin’s administrative as-
sistant, Le-Reeda Lake, was absent
on sick leave for four weeks without
prior notice; that special assistant to
the commissioner Capt. Mary Dug-

for anybody to get upset. I’m in
agreement with him.”

Charles said his firm empties bins
on St. Thomas and hauls trash from
Waste Management Authority collec-
tion sites in a number of government
housing communities.

Regarding how much Waste Man-
agement owes him, Charles replied:
“It depends on what you call a lot.
They’re two months behind, now.”

Caproni wouldn’t say how
much Waste Management owes
him in total.

“It’s a big amount of money,” he
said. “I’m fed up with the whole
thing.”

Caproni said he estimated that
Waste Management owes various
vendors millions of dollars.

The Waste Management Author-
ity’s inability to pay vendors has been
a topic during Senate testimony over
the years.

Steve Aubin, who was interim ex-
ecutive director of the Waste Man-
agement Authority for most of 2016,

told the Senate Finance Committee in
July that the contractors needed to be
paid.

“Tt is clear that the contractors
are bearing the brunt while trying to
provide critical services in hopes of
payment by the authority as soon as
possible,” he said.

Aubin ran the agency after the re-
tirement of May Adams Cornwall un-
til Merritt was hired last month.

“The financial condition of the
Virgin Islands Waste Management
Authority is dire and requires im-
mediate attention and relief,’ Aubin
told senators in July. “The author-
ity’s available cash to pay its con-
tractors/vendors timely is critically
limited, resulting in delayed pay-
ments to its contractors/vendors;
growing accounts payable, which
is currently on the order of $10
million for its major contractors/
vendors; and non-compliance at the
Anguilla and Bovoni landfills with
court ordered mandates.”

An example of the outstanding

obligations owed by Waste Manage-
ment has been highlighted for the
last two years in Senate testimony
during the budget process. For Fiscal
Year 2016, the agency noted it owed
vendor Gem’s Construction $200,000
from fiscal year 2012 to pay for gar-
bage collection services on the island
of St. Thomas.

The Waste Management Authority
noted that it was “unable to identify a
revenue source” to pay Gem’s for the
years-old debt.

During testimony on the Fiscal
Year 2017 budget, Waste Manage-
ment again listed $200,000 owed
to Gem’s Construction for garbage
collection on St. Thomas. However,
Waste Management officials said the
$200,000 was owed from the 2011
fiscal year.

No one from Gem’s Construction
was available for comment Monday
afternoon.

Merritt said he believes the Waste
Management Authority can address
the overdue debt owed to the vendors.

“T think we can. We’ve got to get
a plan in hand and get them paid. If
they provide a service, they should
get paid,” he said.

‘frivolous’ complaints against top cops

gan had potentially disclosed confi-
dential department information to a
third-party vendor for personal gain,
and had used threatening behavior to
create a hostile work environment,
and that she had obstructed Harri-
son’s performance of her duties.

Harrison further alleged that Lt.
Maria Colon-Jones had disrupted a
training presentation, and she said
her termination was retaliatory for
asking for sick leave to be treated for
Zika.

Harrison said that she eventually
fled the Virgin Islands in fear of her
life and that the police department
still owes her $5,000 in back pay,
Harrison said.

Harrison said Monday she’s sub-
mitted her complaints to Gov. Ken-
neth Mapp.

“T was the director of training and
was fired without cause,” she said. “I
had filed several complaints.”

Harrison said she requested 10 days
of medical treatment off-island to com-
bat a Zika infection on Oct. 18.

“Two hours later, I was terminat-
ed,” she said.

Documents provided by Harrison
show she was suspended without pay
on Oct. 18, and terminated on Oct.
28.

Griffin said that while he was un-
dergoing cardio rehab in Florida, he
started hearing about issues involving

Harrison. Ultimately, Richards made
the decision to terminate Harrison,
Griffin said.

“Subsequent to her termination,
she started sending complaints,” he
said. “She said she heard that while
I was away I was practicing law and
not really sick.”

Harrison wasn’t his supervisor,
and wasn’t aware of how the accumu-
lated sick time was being used, Grif-
fin said.

“She submitted so many com-
plaints against so many people,” he
said. “It’s obvious that it’s frivolous.”

The complaints have not yet re-
sulted in an internal investigation,
Richards said.

“T found she was too much of a
distraction for us to move forward
with the actions as required of us by
the mandates of our consent decree,”
Richards said about his decision to
terminate Harrison.

Harrison had failed to submit to a
department background check in a
timely manner, Richards said.

“The department brought her in
on an interim basis initially, and then
she was asked to comply with the
package that we provided in order to
conduct a background investigation,”
he said. “She offered resistance. She
believed she could complete her own
timeline.”

Harrison said she had asked for 10

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014500

days to secure her college transcripts.

“My email specifically says I am
not saying I don’t want a background
check,” she said.

Richards said he ultimately direct-
ed Harrison’s complaints to the legal
department, but he said Harrison
continued to send letters and emails.

A response from the department’s
legal counsel provided by Harrison
says simply that Harrison couldn’t
use the citizen’s complaint process to
complain about things that happened
while she was the director of the
Training Bureau, and that each com-
plaint will be closed as it is received.

“Tn some of her letters and emails,
she appeared very threatening,”
Richards said. “In one of her emails
she wrote ‘You are sicker than a tree
branch that’s going to be cut down
very soon.’ It’s one ignorance after
another.”

Harrison disputes that charac-
terization.

“I’m very professional,” she said.

Griffin was on legitimate sick leave
when he was in Florida, Richards
said.

“He was being treated and he en-
tered into a program in Florida,” he
said. “The woman is on a witch hunt
all over.”
