misconduct occurred. He has also produced other evidence that he relies upon to refute
the credibility of the allegations against him.

The parties believe it is time to take advantage of the new information that has come to
light on both sides during the litigation and put these matters behind them.

Given the events that have transpired since the filing of the documents in the federal
court and in this action in which Dershowitz was accused of sexual misconduct, including
the court order striking the allegations in the federal court filings, and the records and
other documents produced by the parties, Edwards and Cassell acknowledge that it was a
mistake to have filed sexual misconduct accusations against Dershowitz; and the sexual
misconduct accusations made in all public filings (including all exhibits) are hereby
withdrawn. Dershowitz also withdraws his accusations that Edwards and Cassell acted
unethically.

Neither Edwards, Cassell, nor Dershowitz have any intention of repeating the allegations
against one another.
