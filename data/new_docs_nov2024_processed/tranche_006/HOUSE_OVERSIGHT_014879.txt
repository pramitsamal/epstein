Note that at current strip oil prices of ~$55 Brent, this is closer to $14.4/sh of which
Payara is ~$6/sh or $2.0bn. On a ‘risked’ basis, we believe this is a reasonable
development scenario representative of any incremental discovery that resembles Liza
recalling that the partners have identified over 20 additional drilling prospects. On the
assumption of a ‘plus three year’ development scenario after Liza, the potential impact
on incremental production and cash flow is significant for Hess while the cumulative
impact also becomes significant for XOM.

The charts below show our latest assessment of how a compound timeline for a Liza /
Payara development could look, if Payara as a project does indeed prove to be a look

alike to Liza.

Critically, Guyana is now being described as a ‘DHI play’ meaning seismic and core have
been sufficiently calibrated as to provide direct hydrocarbon indicators and hence de-
risking future exploration tests. This appears confirmed again by the latest ‘Snoek’
SUCCESS.

XOM’s development plan calls for an FPSO (floating production and storage offloading
vessel} with production capacity of about 150,000 boepd for every 450mm barrels of
recoverable reserves, with plateau production extending up to 10 years. We suggest
management’s commentary supports gross production capacity from current discovered
resource of at least 600,000 boepd.
