Estimates vs Consensus

Our 1Q17 rev/EPS estimates for $535mn/S0.03 are slightly above the Street and above
the implied midpoint of management’s guidance (based on EBITDA and EBITDA margin
outlook}. Despite our near-term concerns, we believe the outlook was sufficiently
conservative. That said, we see risk to current consensus estimates for the year, and we
are below Street revenue at $2.3bn for 2017 vs consensus at $2.35bn, though slightly
ahead on EBITDA on more moderate cost assumptions. Our 2017 estimates assume a
conservative 4% MAU growth for the year.

Our $14.50 price objective is based on 12x our 2018 EBITDA estimate, which reflects a
discount to the online media group (13x). We believe the Twitter platform has slowing
user and revenue growth and as such, we expect the stock to trade at a sustained
discount to online media peers, with potential M&A adding some offsetting downside
support.
