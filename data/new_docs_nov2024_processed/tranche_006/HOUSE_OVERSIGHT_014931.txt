Yelp (Neutral, $43 PO)

Stock view: Likely to be some improvement vs last quarter

Yelp is coming off of a quarter with decelerating app unique devices, weak new
customer adds, and decelerating sales force growth, and it seems likely that one or two
of these metrics will improve. The tone at our recent investor meetings with the CFO
seem to suggest that 4Q issues did not signal a break in the model (see On the road
with Yelp), and we expect an improvement q/q customer adds. We think the company
should be able achieve Street 1Q revenue and EBITDA estimates, though we won’t be
surprised to see the 2Q17 outlook come in slightly below current Street estimates.

For the full year outlook, while we believe the implied expense growth in the 2017
outlook is somewhat conservative, management appears focused on investing in the
business for now and we think upside is more likely to come in 2Q or 3Q. Overall, we
remain somewhat cautious on the stock given potential revenue deceleration due to
tough comps and a deceleration in sales force growth.

On the cost front, management has been clear in its intention to invest in performance
marketing, which could take time to bear fruit. In addition, we believe sales force growth
to stabilize/increase going forward, which would seem to suggest potential cost
headwinds relative to recent quarters. Finally, while we don’t have the specific
financials, the addition of Nowait ($40mn acquisition closed 2/28) likely encompasses a
moderate bump up in opex with limited revenue to offset.

As we look ahead, we are encouraged with the three transitions within company and we
will be looking for progress on the following on the call. The first is connections
between consumers and businesses on Yelp through clicks, reservation services,
ordering, and Request a Quote. The second is a ramp up in performance marketing as
users engage in more measurable events. The third is new customer acquisition via
alternative channels, including national customers from outside sales alongside self-
serve customers via online channels.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: new account adds, app unique devices growth

Given the miss last quarter and pressure on sales force headcount, local advertising
accounts will be important gauge of overall execution. Other key metrics include app
unique devices growth, which has been decelerating since mid-2015 from 51% y/y to
20% in 4Q16. Performance marketing could reverse the trend, but it could take some
time. Finally, while management continues to highlight a decoupling of sales force
growth and topline trends, investors still pay attention to overall sales force growth,
particularly given the three consecutive quarters of deceleration from 44% y/y (1Q16) to
11% y/y (4Q17). Management has indicated that sales force growth in 2017 should be
in the double digits.
