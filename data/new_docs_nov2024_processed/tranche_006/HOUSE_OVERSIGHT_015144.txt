| am not an airhead. I’ m a victim, partly of my own making. And
mostly, I' ma political pawn of the spin doctors. There are several books
being written about the White House scandal, but only a few individuals
know what really happened, and only | know who / really am, which is why
| have decided to write this book. | would write it even if | didn’ t need the
money for legal expenses. My life may be ruined—at least my reputation
will be forever tainted—but the truth must be told.

take a free-association test, the psychiatrist would say “Monica
Lewinsky” and the patient would immediately respond “Oral sex.

across—and the correct word will be “fellatio.”
