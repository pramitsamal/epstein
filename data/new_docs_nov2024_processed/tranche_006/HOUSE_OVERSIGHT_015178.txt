These are rough times, but it’ s extremely important to develop a
sense of optimism. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists periodically updates a
clock on their cover to indicate how close we’ re moving toward nuclear
war. Recently they moved it from four minutes to midnight to three
minutes to midnight, with midnight representing total annihilation. |
don’ t know exactly what their time scale is—whether one minute
represents a month or a year or a decade—but, whichever, they’ re saying
that we are all now only three minutes away from the ultimate holocaust.

That’ s the bad news.

The good news is that atomic scientists are just as fucked-up as the
rest of us. They overeat, they forget to floss, they don’ t have time for
serial orgasms, or they suffer from premature ejaculations, and they set
their clocks fifteen minutes ahead so that if they need to mail a letter by
six 0’ clock and their clock says it’ s ten after six, it means they still have
five minutes to get to the mailbox. So that clock on the cover of the
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists is fifteen minutes fast. We don’ t have just

three minutes till doomsday; we have eighteen minutes.
