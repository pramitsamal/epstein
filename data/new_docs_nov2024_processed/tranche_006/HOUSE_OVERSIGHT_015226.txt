Murder At the Conspiracy Convention

‘The history of civilization is the history of wartare
between secret societies.” --/shmael Reed

In the men’ s room at the airport, a man standing at the urinal a
couple of urinals away from my urinal was urinating without aiming his
penis. Both hands were flossing his teeth. A monument to multi-tasking.
I’ Il admit that | occasionally brush my teeth while I’ m urinating—at least
that leaves me with one hand free to steer—but this guy could possibly be
the only human being on earth who pisses and flosses simultaneously.

He must have practiced at home before he decided to go public.
And of course he was proud of his manual dexterity. Maybe he even has a
license plate that says PFLOSS, though other drivers might assume it’ s his
name, not his avocation. In any case, that image immediately replaced my
previous visual mantra: seeing one of the kids on a school bus holding up
to the window a sign that read HELP US!--and laughing with his
classmates.

Now, on Memorial Day weekend, | was catching a flight to San Jose,
California. | was headed for Conspiracy Con 2001, a convention featuring

the prophets of the sinister.
