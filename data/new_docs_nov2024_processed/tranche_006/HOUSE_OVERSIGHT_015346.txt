Betty Dodson, sex educator and producer of Viva La Vulva, says, “|
think we have changing ideas about what’ s public and what’ s private.
And now that nudity is more public--nude beaches, routine nudity in film,
and the enormous amount of exhibitionism and porn on the Web--I’ m
not surprised to see a trend toward pubic shaving. | think it’ s probably
here to stay.” She told me that, “Thanks to the lack of a comprehensive
sex education for kids, young girls now want their vulvas to look like porn
stars because that's what their boyfriends jerk off to and prefer. It's all they
know.” But a new study has concluded that pubic hair is returning: “The
men don’ tcare and the women don’ tcan’ t bother.”

Welcome back, good old bush. Hide and seek a friendly clit.

Ironically, although Arnold Schwarzenegger was only joking when he
announced that 4e was going to get a Bikini wax, actually Beverly Hills skin
care and waxing expert Nance Mitchell has about fifty regular male
customers that come for pubic waxing who “are not gay and they are not
porn stars. Some go totally bare, some just do the shaft and up around the
pelvic area.” She explains that “It depends on what their wives and
girlfriends want. Men go along because removing the hair makes the
whole package look bigger.”

Ah, yes, the //usion of size does matter.
