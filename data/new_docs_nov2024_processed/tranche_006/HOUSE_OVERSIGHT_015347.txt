The Taste of Sperm

Online sexology columnist Sandor Gardos was asked, “How do |
increase the amount of my ejaculate? |’ ve noticed porn stars seem to
ejaculate copious amounts of fluid, and |’ d like to be able to wow my
partner.” Dr. Gardos points out that “the actors in porn films are
professionals. Even they often don’ t ejaculate that much--sometimes
movie makers will supplement with synthetic semen shot from a small
tube.”

Well, I' m just shocked to realize that somewhere in America there
must be a group of scientists in a laboratory who earn their salaries by
manufacturing fake semen.

Meanwhile, ManNotIncluded.com has become the first cyberspace
sperm bank for lesbians and single women who want to become pregnant.
They are matched with anonymous donors who have the desired race, eye
color, height and weight, then sent instructions on how to inseminate
themselves. John Gonzalez, founder of the website, hopes this service will
overcome the hurdles presented by bureaucracies and fertility clinics who

are prejudiced against same-sex couples.
