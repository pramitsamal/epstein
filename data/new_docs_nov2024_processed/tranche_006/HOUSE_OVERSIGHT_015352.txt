involuntary shit eating, and what we’ re talking about here is the
voluntary kind.

For many years | heard stories that comic actor Danny Thomas, the
star of Make Room for Daddy, was a coprophagiac. | assumed it was just
another urban legend until | bumped into an old friend who was now
working as a prostitute in Hollywood. Over lunch, she mentioned the
names of some of her celebrity clients, including Danny Thomas. She told
me how he had hired her to save her solid waste in her panties so that he
could rub those panties on his face and gobble up her shit as though it
were cotton candy.

When he finished, he would wash his hands and face thoroughly
then pay her and, as if coming out of a trance, he’ dsay, “Where was |?”
He was trying to distance himself from what he had just done. Instant
denial. Since then, | have believed that Danny Thomas’ s fundraising for
Saint Jude’ s Hospital was really for the purpose of having secret access to
their bedpans.

Anyway, |! googled “eating shit.” Topping the list was “Shit Eating
Grins: In Defense of Adam Sandler.” But sure enough, | was soon led to
hardcore shit-eating sites, which | found totally disgusting, yet absolutely

riveting. You may not want to read any further, but we both know you will.
