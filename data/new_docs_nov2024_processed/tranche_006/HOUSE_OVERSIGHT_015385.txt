his girlfriend.” Robin and | were sitting next to each other, and we
simultaneously crossed that joke off our imaginary lists.

There were short-jokes galore. Have a few free samples: “Short? |
carry a life-sized portrait of Harlan in my wallet.” “Harlan’ s parents
were normal, but the milkman was a syphilitic dwarf.” And the producer
of Twilight Zone, Phil de Guere, complained, “It took Harlan nine months
before he figured out how to shoot himself in the foot at 7wilight Zone
and get canned. But of all the people | have worked with, Harlan is by far
the shortest. Harlan doesn’ t have a short fuse. He /sa short fuse.”

My own short-joke was, “Actually, this isn’ t a roast. It’ s more like
a microwave.” Robin said, “Harlan is a tall Paul Williams, a white Paul
Simon.” | pointed out that “Harlan is on the right side of a lot of
important fights. He’ s fought against racism and sexism. That’ s why this
whole panel is white males.”

A roast by definition overflows with irreverence, insults, and
raunchiness. Examples: “If it’ s true that you are what you eat, Harlan
would be a vagina.” Stan Lee of comic-book infamy said, “Harlan is a
very difficult person to arouse. Ask any of his former wives.” And Robin
contributed a metaphorical dick joke: “If you’ re hung like a field mouse,

don’ t stand in the wind.”
