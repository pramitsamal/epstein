In the spring of 1982, there was a Radical Humor Festival at New
York University. That weekend, the festival sponsored an evening of
radical comedy. The next day, my performance was analyzed by an
unofficial women's caucus. Robin Tyler ( “Il am not a lesbian comic--l am a
comic who is a lesbian” ) served as the spokesperson for their conclusions.
What had caused a stir was my reference to the use of turkey basters by
single mothers-to-be who were attempting to impregnate themselves by
artificial insemination. Tyler explained to me, “You have to understand,
some women still have a hang-up about penetration.”

men still feel threatened by turkey basters.”
