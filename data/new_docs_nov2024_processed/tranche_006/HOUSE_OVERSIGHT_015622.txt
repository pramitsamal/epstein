these documents, not only in defamatory statements broadcast worldwide, but also in his
pleadings before this Court and in recent depositions. Indeed, Dershowitz said in his
media interviews that he wants “everything to be made public” and implied that Edwards
and Cassell had something to hide. Accordingly, Dershowitz has failed to carry his heavy
burden to justify sealing these presumptively-public documents.

L DERSHOWITZ HAS NOT JUSTIFIED SEALING ALLEGED
DEFAMATORY RECORDS THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THIS
DEFAMATION CASE.

In his motion, Dershowitz never recounts the heavy burden that he must carry to seal the
records at issue. To be sure, Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 allows for the sealing
of “confidential” materials. But the Rule begins by recounting the overarching principle that
“t]he public shall have access to all records of the judicial branch of government, except as
provided below.” Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(a). This rule is a codification of the Florida
Supreme Court’s admonition that a “astrong presumption of openness exists for all court
proceedings. A trial is a public event, and the filed records of court proceedings are public
records available for public examination.” Barron vy. Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531
So.2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988) (emphasis added). In light of this presumption of openness, “[t]he
burden of proof in [closure] proceedings shall always be on the party seeking closure.” Jd. To
obtain a sealing order, the party seeking sealing must carry a “heavy burden.” Id.

Remarkably, Dershowitz fails to acknowledge these well-settled principles. More
important, he even fails to cite (much less discuss) the limited substantive exceptions to this

general principle of access— and which specific exception he believes applies to this
