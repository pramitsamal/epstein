changed to the one we use today: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, ‘MRI.
The system works by applying a strong magnetic field to your body to
excite the hydrogen atoms. Since we are mostly H2O there are plenty of
these.

Three magnetic fields are used. First, an extremely strong field is
applied to the whole body. This causes all the hydrogen atoms in the
water and fat to spin in line with the field of the machine. Next a gradient
field is applied to the top of your head so it is slightly more magnetized
than the bottom of your feet and, finally, a pulse of magnetism is applied
to the top of your head. The spinning hydrogen atoms line up a little
more when this pulse is applied and then randomize again when it is
switched off. As they randomize, they give off energy. The clever part is
the gradient field which causes the atoms to give off energy at slightly
different times — the top of your head first, your neck a fraction of a
