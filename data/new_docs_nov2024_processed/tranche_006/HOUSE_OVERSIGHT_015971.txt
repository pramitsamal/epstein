and this is where the machine's greater power comes from. Of course
such a thing might easily fit inside our skulls, and the physics within our
brains are certainly capable of using real analogue values.

The biggest stumbling block for Siegelmann’s idea is the information
that gives her machines their power is fine-grained and easily destroyed by
noise in the environment. This is not just from the sort of electrical noise
we hear when our cell phones interfere with the radio, but the precision
required by her machines is so exacting that anything might interfere
with them. For example, gravitational waves caused by the motions of
nearby stars would disturb calculations at only the fiftieth decimal place.
Since it is these digits that constitute the difference between an ARNN
and a regular Turing machine, most people conclude ARNNs can’t work.
There is one effect stemming from the quantum world which might
come to the rescue. The potential to do something in the quantum world
is sufficient to modify the behavior of a system even if the system does
not actually do that specific thing. This is called a counterfactual process.
The possibility an ARNN might perform infinite precision calculations
may be enough to give the machine the edge, even though in practice it is
disturbed by noise. This is speculation upon speculation, but interesting
nevertheless.
