Jeffrey Epstein may be a convicted pedophile and accused sex- slave master — but that didn’t stop him from getting some tender loving
treatment from the Manhattan DA's Office.

Prosectors went to bat for the billionaire pervert at a 2011 legal hearing, asking a judge to cut the filthy- rich felon a break on the severity of
his sex- offender status, according to court documents.

ADA Jennifer Gaffney supported a request by Epstein — who allegedly peddled $15,000-a-night teen “sex slaves” to rich men like Britain’s
Prince Andrew — that he only be listed as a Level 1 pervert during a hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court, according to legal transcripts.

The sicko investment magnate has just finished serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence in Florida for soliciting a minor girl for
prostitution. The hearing was to determine what kind of offender status he would have in New York, where he keeps a vacation home.

The city ADA argued that since “there was only an indictment for one victim,” Epstein shouldn’t have to register as Level 3 — which would
require he travel to New York every 90 days and check in with cops.
