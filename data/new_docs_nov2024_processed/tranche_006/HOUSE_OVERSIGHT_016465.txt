Hi Sue,

Regarding your first question: pursuant to Civil Rights Law § 50-b, our office’s practice in appellate sex
crimes matters is to file documents under seal. This is not particular to People v. Epstein; it is routine
across our appellate filings. My understanding is that it is also the Appellate Division’s (the court's)
practice to maintain such seal.

That being said, | have discussed your second question with our attorneys. If the Post petitions the
court, and the court asks the People for our positon, we will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief.

Thanks.

Danny Frost
Director of Communications
Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, Jr.

Hi Dan,

Please explain why the DA's office didn't file a redacted brief, but rather covered up all the facts.
If we filed a petition for a redacted brief, would the DA's office fight it or cooperate?

Thank you,

Sue
