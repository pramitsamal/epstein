Peter, as requested, attached is sewage flow data from our Lake Worth Billings and ECRWRF monthly
report. | am seeking the peak daily flows, but that is going to take additional time.

Base upon the monthly flows, here is the average daily flow for each entity in Fiscal Year 2008 expressed
as million gallons a day:

Month WPB LW

Oct 2.70 0.654
Nov 2.39 0.593

Jan 2.33 0.668

Jun 2.09 0.389
Jul 2.22 0.552
