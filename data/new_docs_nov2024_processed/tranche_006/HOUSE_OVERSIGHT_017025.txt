IlI.4C. Dictionary Coverage

To determine the coverage of the OED and Merriam-Webster’s Unabridge Dictionary (MW), we
performed the above analysis on randomly generated subsets of the lexicon in eight frequency deciles
(ranging from 10° — 10° to 10° — 10° ). The samples contained 500 candidate, words each lor all but the
top 3 deciles; the samples corresponding to the top 3 deciles (10° - 10%, 10*- 10°, 10°- 10° 2
contained 100 candidate words each.

A native speaker with no knowledge of the experiment being performed determined which words from our
random samples fell into the P, B, or R categories (to enable a fair comparison, we excluded the N
category from our analysis as both OED an MW exclude them). The annotator then attempted to find a
definition for the words in both the online edition of the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary or in the
online version of the Oxford English Dictionary’s 2™ edition. Notably, the performance of the latter was
boosted appreciably by its inclusion of Merriam-Webster’s Medical Dictionary. Results of this analysis are
shown in Appendix.

To estimate the fraction of dark matter in the English language, we applied the formula:
sum over all deciles of Pworg*Poepiw*Nigram, with:

- Nigram the number of 1grams in the decile

- Pworg the proportion of words (R,B or P) in this decile

- Poepw the proportion of words of that decile that are covered in OED or MW.

We obtain 52% of dark matter, words not listed in either MW or the OED. With the procedure above, we
estimate the number of words excluding proper nouns at 572,000; this results in 297,000 words unlisted
in even the most comprehensive commercial and historical dictionaries.

I1.4D. Analysis New and Obsolete words in the American Heritage
Dictionary

We obtained a list of the 4804 vocabulary items that were added to the AHD4 in 2000 from the
dictionary’s editorial staff. These 4804 words were not in AHD3 (1992) — although, on rare occasions a
word could have featured in earlier editions of the dictionary (this is the case for “gypseous”, which was
included in AHD1 and AHD2).

Similar to our study of the dictionary’s lexicon, we restrict ourselves to 1grams. We find 2077 1-grams
newly added to the AHD4. Median frequency (Fig 2D) is computed by obtaining all frequencies of this set
of words and computing its median.

Next, we ask which 1grams appear in AHD4 but are not part of the year 2000 lexicon any more
(frequency lower than one part per billion between 1990 and 2000). We compute the lexical frequency of
the 1-gram headwords in AHD, and find a small number (2,220) that are not part of the lexicon today. We
show the mean frequency of these 2,220 words (Fig 2F).

111.5. The Evolution of Grammar

III.5A. Ensemble of verbs studied

Our list of irregular verbs was derived from the supplemental materials of Ref 18 (main text). The full list
of 281 verbs is given in Appendix.

Our objective is to study the way word frequency affects the trajectories of the irregular compared with
regular past tense. To do so, we must be confident that

- the 1grams used refer to the verbs themselves: “to dive/dove” cannot be used, as “dove” is a
common noun for a bird. Or, in the verb “to bet/bet”, the irregular preterit cannot be distinguished from the
