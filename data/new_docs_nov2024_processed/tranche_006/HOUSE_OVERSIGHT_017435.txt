Since the theme of this book is change—change in the freedom of expression, change in the way
homicides are prosecuted and defended, change in the nature of media coverage of high profile
cases, change in the uses and misuses of “human rights,” change in attitudes toward race, change
in the relationship between religion and government, and change in the way law is taught and
learned—it is appropriate to end with changes I have experienced in my own personal and
professional life over the years.

During each of my seven decades of adult life, I have undergone significant change, beginning in
my second decade, when I was a teenager about to enter college, through my eighth decade as I
approach retirement from Harvard. It is to these changes that I now turn.
