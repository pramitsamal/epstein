RICHARD SAUL WURMAN

Described by Fortune magazine as an “intellectual hedonist”

with a “hummingbird mind,” Richard Saul Wurman
seeks ways to make the complex clear. Recognizing at
an early age that his ignorance is his greatest asset, he
has made it his mission to sort through the abundance
of information that is available on every topic, and
design the techniques to make it understandable.

In doing so he has continually sought to put himself
in the presence of extraordinary people, including (all now
all deceased), Francis Crick, Richard Feynman, Jonas Salk,
Eva Zeisel, Louis I. Kahn, Charles Eames, Frank Stanton and
Schuyler van Renssalaer Cammann, and Arnold Toynbee.
There are many others. The only two bosses he had who
didn’t fire him were Lou Kahn and Charlie Eames.

As aresult, Wurman has had many lives: as an author
(83 books); FAIA Architect, 13-year partner in Murphy Levy
Wurman Architects; cartographer (mapped 1/3 of the Mayan
city of Tikal and current project 19.20.21.); teacher (Cambridge
University, England; Princeton; Washington University,
St. Louis; University of Southern California; University of
California Los Angeles; City College of New York, and Dean,
Cal Poly School of Design); urban designer (recipient of MIT’s
Kevin Lynch award in urban design); graphic designer (AIGA
Gold Medal, membership in AGI and inducted into the Art
Directors Hall of Fame); information theorist Information
