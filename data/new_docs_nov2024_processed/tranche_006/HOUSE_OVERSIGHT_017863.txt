Rastelli v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,
79 N.Y.2d 289, 295, 582 N.Y.S.2d 378, 591
N.E.2d 222 (1992)). Conspiracy “requires
an agreement to commit a tortious act.”
Id. at 122-23. Aiding and abetting “re-
quires that the defendant have given sub-
stantial assistance or encouragement to
the primary wrongdoer.” Jd. at 123.
“[U]nder either theory, the defendant
must know the wrongful nature of the
primary actor’s conduct.” Jd. (finding no
concerted action liability where airline had
no knowledge mother was removing
daughter from country without father’s ap-
proval).

i. Causation

Judge Robertson found his consideration
of Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s FSIA
defenses did not present an opportunity
for a general discourse on causation since
Plaintiffs’ theory would stretch causation
to “terra incognita.” Burnett I, 292
F.Supp.2d at 20. This Court agrees with
Judge Robertson’s conclusion, but it un-
dertakes the causation analysis because a
similar review will be necessary in its con-
sideration of the Defendants’ motions for
failure to state a claim. See Part III
below.

Plaintiffs place great reliance on Halber-
stam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C.Cir.1983)
and Bowm v. Quranic Literacy Institute. &
Holy Land Foundation for Relief & Devel-
opment, 291 F.3d 1000, 1028 (7th Cir.2002)
(“Bowm IT”). Neither of these cases con-
cern the tortious activity exception to the
FSIA, but they do explain liability under

28. The court in Halberstam outlined the ele-
ments of aiding and abetting as: “(1) the
party whom the defendant aids must perform
a wrongful act that causes an injury; (2) the
defendant must be generally aware of his role
as part of an overall illegal or tortious activity
at the time that he provides the assistance;
(3) the defendant must knowingly and sub-
stantially assist the principal violation.’’ Hal-

the ATA and for aiding and abetting and
conspiracy.“ In Halberstam, the defen-
dant was found liable as a joint venturer
for a killing that occurred during a burgla-
ry at which she was not present. Halber-
stam, 705 F.2d at 488; see also Lumbard
v. Maglia, Inc, 621 F.Supp. 1529, 1536
(S.D.N.Y.1985) (““[T]hose who aid or abet
or conspire in tortious conduct are jointly
and severally liable with other participants
in the tortious conduct, regardless of the
degree of their participation or culpability
in the overall scheme.”). The court found
that the defendant’s intimate relationship
with the burglar and her assistance in his
other illegal ventures “defie[d] credulity
that [she] did not know that something
illegal was afoot.” Halberstam, 705 F.2d
at 486.

In Boim, the district court had denied a
motion to dismiss by U.S.-based charities
alleged to have aided and abetted interna-
tional terrorism. Bowm v. Quranic Litera-
cy Inst. & Holy Land Found. 127
F.Supp.2d 1002, 1018 (N.D.IIL2001)
(“Bom I”). The Seventh Circuit affirmed
the decision and held that the parents of a
yeshiva student killed in 1996 in Israel by
members of the military wing of Hamas
could prove that the defendants aided and
abetted their son’s murder under the ATA
if they could demonstrate that the chari-
ties “knew of Hamas’ illegal activities, that
they desired to help those activities suc-
ceed, and they engaged in some act of
helping the illegal activities.” Bowm I],
291 F.3d at 1023. The court explained
that “[floreseeability is the cornerstone of

berstam, 705 F.2d at 477. It described the
elements of civil conspiracy as: “(1) an agree-
ment between two or more persons; (2) to
participate in an unlawful act, or a lawful act
in an unlawful manner; (3) an injury caused
by an unlawful overt act performed by one of
the parties to the agreement; (4) which overt
act was done pursuant to and in furtherance
of the common scheme.” Jd.
