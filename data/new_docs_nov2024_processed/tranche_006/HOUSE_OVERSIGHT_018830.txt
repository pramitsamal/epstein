Conclusions

Economic conditions in the U.S. Virgin Islands appear to be slower to recover than many areas of the
region, particularly in St. Croix, where industrial development had previously been more of a focus
than tourism The closure of the Hovensa refinery and the failure to facilitate a sale to a buyer who can
re-open the facility as a refinery will continue to plague St. Croix until other new developments occur
that can create new jobs. The assets of the refinery were recently sold at auction, but operating
agreement with the USVI Government only states the buyers will use the oil storage portion in
addition to constructing an asphalt plant on the property, which projects to only 80 jobs created in the
immediate future. There appears to be ongoing resurgence in tourism for St. Thomas and St. John, and
real estate activity appears to be improving; however, many businesses — even those catering to cruise
ship passengers — continue to struggle. Our forecast is for continued improvement in arrivals and
hotel statistics, but only gradual economic improvement for the overall territory.
