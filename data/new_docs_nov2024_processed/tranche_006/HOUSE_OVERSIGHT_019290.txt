BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

who have little interest in the democratizing mission
traditionally espoused by mainstream parties with deep
roots in the global struggles of the 20th century. The
new mood is reflected in the democracies foreign poli-
cies, many of which are aimed more at seeking national
advantage than at promoting the common good.

The rise of populist politics in democracies could give
modern authoritarianism a new lease on life. While it
may no longer be as useful for entrenched autocracies
to mask their nature with an illusion of pluralism, free-
ly elected leaders with authoritarian ambitions can
use similar techniques to replace genuine democratic
institutions with hollowed-out fagades. This process

is already under way in the countries that have been
dubbed “illiberal democracies.

With states across the spectrum shifting in an
authoritarian direction, there is not much comfort in
the fact that repressive regimes are fundamentally
more unstable and vulnerable to breakdowns than
democracies. Major authoritarian governments may
collapse in the face of economic crises, popular
protests, or succession battles. But in the absence of
international pressure and support, it seems doubt-
ful that they would be replaced by aspiring democra-
cies. Indeed, they could be succeeded by something
even worse.
