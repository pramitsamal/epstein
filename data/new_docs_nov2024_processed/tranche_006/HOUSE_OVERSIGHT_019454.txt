e The tax code includes a withholding tax provision that discriminates against foreign
investors (PRS Group 2002, PRS Group 2003, PRS Group, 2005, PRS Group, 2009;
USAID, 2006).

As a tule, investment in “sensitive” sectors, such as electricity, water and telecommunications
require special government concession. Investment in the public health sector requires
authorization from the Ministry of Public Health and Population. Investment in agriculture is
subject to the Ministry of Agriculture’s approval. Exploiting mineral and energy resources require
permits from the Office of Mining and Energy. Besides, natural resources are considered as the
property of the country (PRS Group, 2009; Schaaf, 2009).

Haiti after the Earthquake in 2010

The January 12, 2010 earthquake had inflicted massive human and financial damage to the country.
The natural disaster damaged homes, commercial & government buildings, cities infrastructure, and
took many people lives. The estimated monetary loss is $11.5 billion (U.S. Department of State,
2010).

According to the World Bank report (2010), 70% of the total damage and losses were done in the
private sector. Therefore, this has lead to the loss of production, reduction in revenues, loss of jobs
and wages, increase in production cost, etc. Additionally, the job market experienced 8.5 % of pre-
earthquake jobs decrease due to devastation.

Ninety percent of businesses are informal in Haiti; ninety-five percent of businesses are SME (Small
and Medium sized Enterprise). Business people indicated having various problems due to the
natural disaster. Some of them lost their houses and facilities; therefore, they do not have money
for rebuilding all the facilities. However, a vast majority of businesses do not pay taxes and do not
contribute to the countries’ official GDP (Investment Facilitation centre, 2010).

Government Role in Economy

Generally, government’s role in the economy is minimal. There are several government subsidies
and price controls; however, goods are mainly traded at market prices. Considering the fact that
there are over 70 % of imports in Haiti, the Haitian government has eliminated tariffs and non-
tariff barriers in order to liberalize trade (CIA, 2010; World Bank, 2010; PRS Group, 2009).

At the same time, there is a project for creating several trade free zones and exclusion from the
taxes of the foreign investors (PRS Group, 2009.
