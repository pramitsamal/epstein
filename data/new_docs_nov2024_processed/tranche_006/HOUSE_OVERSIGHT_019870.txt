wondering how | could have missed “Moonlight”’s triumph. Why couldn’t | see the forest through
the trees? | must have been in La La-land.

XOXO,
Peggy

P.S. The following weekend | arrive in the Dominican Republic at Casa de Campo at the home
of sugar baron Pepe Fanjul and his wife Emilia. Juan Carlos, the past king of Spain, wants to
watch a few movies with me. | pulled a dozen DVDs out of my bag and say, Your Majesty,
which one? He says, First, La La Land for fun, then Moonlight because it won, then The
Founder for American ingenuity.”
