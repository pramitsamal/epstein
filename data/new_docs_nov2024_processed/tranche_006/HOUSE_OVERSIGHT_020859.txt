Note: 1) Congressional Budget Office defines a structural surplus or deficit as the budget surplus or deficit that would occur under current law if the influences of
the business cycle on the budget — the automatic stabilizers — were removed, and cyclical surplus or deficit as the automatic net changes in revenues and outlays
that are attributable to cyclical movements in real (inflation-adjusted) output and unemployment. CBO compiled this data from Dept. of Commerce’s Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA), which maintains the national income and product accounts (NIPA). An important difference between the official budget deficit and the
NIPA measure of net federal government saving is that the latter excludes such purely financial transactions as the sale of government assets, and most
transactions under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, because those transactions do not help to measure current production and income. In addition, historical
NIPA data are subject to significant revision; historical budget data, by contrast, are rarely revised significantly. Source: 1996-2006 data per CBO, “The Effects of
KP Automatic Stabilizers on the Federal Budget,” 5/10, 2007-2010 data per White House OMB F2012 Budget Analytical Perspective.

erlcits. ‘cyclical deficit,’ respectively, these terms are not interchangeable and have different definitions. Congressional Budget Office defines a

structural surplus or deficit as the budget surplus or deficit that would occur under current law if the influences of the business cycle on the

budget — the automatic stabilizers — were removed, and cyclical surplus or deficit as the automatic net changes in revenues and outlays that
