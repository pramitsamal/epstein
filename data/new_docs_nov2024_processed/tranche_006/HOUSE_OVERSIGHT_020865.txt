Summary: 40-Year USA, Inc. Trends*

e America is spending beyond its means, and the problem — with mounting
losses & increasing debt — is getting worse, not better

e Healthcare spending and obesity are rising dramatically.
e Education spending is growing slower than healthcare spending.
e Defense spending is declining on relative basis.

e More and more Americans are on the government payroll or receive
government subsidies for retirement income, medical care, housing, and
food.

e Inequality of income and wealth is rising, and fewer Americans pay income
taxes to support USA Inc.

e Government increasingly resorts to borrowing to fund rising spending
levels (primarily for entitlement programs)...

Note: *We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of data points and trends. We did not

choose the most recent 40-year period (1969 to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent

Significant tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969 and subsequently many metrics (like individual income and corporate

KP profit as well as federal budget surplus / deficit and debt levels) were significantly off their ‘normal’ levels.
