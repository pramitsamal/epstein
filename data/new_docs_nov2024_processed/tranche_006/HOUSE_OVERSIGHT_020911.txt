That’s a Math Problem...

e If an expense rises by 26% and the ability to pay rises by only 3%,
the math doesn’t work. A computer in a science fiction movie might
blurt out, ‘does not compute...does not compute...’

e “Something’s Gotta Give...’ as the 2003 film put it.

e A mathematician or economist would say, ‘the expense must go down or
the ability to pay must rise to match the expense.’

e Simple math implies that the age for collecting full benefits should rise
from 67 to 72, so that expenses more closely match workers’ ability to
pay. Under this scenario, while Americans are living 30% longer, the
‘retirement’ age would rise just 7%, still well below the increase in life
expectancy since Social Security was created.
