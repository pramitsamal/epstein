Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs):

Recipients of 28% of Net Government (Taxpayer) Funding

e GSEs Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac extended their guarantees on residential
mortgages from conventional loans into Alt-A, interest-only and subprime
loans.

While technically not part of the federal government, Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac
have enjoyed an implicit government guarantee on their debt and RMBS
securities as investors believed (correctly, as it turned out) that the federal
government would support these entities if they failed. As a result, GSEs’ long-
term debt securities receive AAA/Aaa ratings from all rating agencies and are
classified by financial markets as “agency securities” with interest rates above
USA Treasuries but below AAA corporate debts.

Post placing Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac into a government conservatorship,
USA Inc. has so far invested $152B' into these two GSEs with an estimated $8-
13B2 more likely over the next 10 years, given the ongoing weakness in housing
market and the poor underwriting by Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac.
