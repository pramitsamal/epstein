I understand you have some questions about my client,
Jeffrey Epstein. Given that much of the press coverage
surrounding Mr. Epstein has been inaccurate and in some
instances, defamatory, I would like to suggest that you
send me any facutal questions so that I can provide you
with accurate responses.

I am also available to speak with you. My number is
212 446 4970.

Thank you,

Jay
