were several other girls
brought in 2004 and 2005 to
an upstairs room at the home
for similar massages and
sexual touching.

The indictment charged
Epstein only with felony so-
licitation of prostitution. The
state attorney’s office later
added the charge of procur
ing underage girls for that
purpose.

Prosecutor
lohlavek said of the plea: “I
took into consideration the
length the trial would. have
been and witnesses having
to testify” about sometimes
embarrassing incidents.

Epstein may have made
a serious mistake soon after
he was charged. He rejected
an offer to plead guilty to one

‘It’s validation
of what we're saying
in the civil cases.’

JEFFREY HERMAN
Attorney who represents alleged
victims, commenting on the plea

The judge was skeptical but
agreed to it.

Epstein’s legal woes don’t
end with Monday’ plea.
There are four pending fed-
eral civil lawsuits and one
in state court related to his
behavior. At least one woman
has sued him in New York,
where he owns a_51,000-
square-foot Manhattan man-
sion.

“Its validation of what
we're saying in the civil
cases,” said Miami attorney
Jeffrey Herman,- who repre-
sents the alleged victims in
the federal lawsuits. West
Palm Beach attorney Ted
Leopold represents one al-
leged victim in a civil suit in
state court. He said he antici-
pates amending that lawsuit
to add “a few other clients”
as well.

In the criminal case, po-
lice went so far as to scour
Epstein’s trash and conduct
surveillance at Palm Beach

ternational Airport, where
they watched for his private
jet so they would know when
he was in town. They con-
cluded that Epstein paid girls
$200 to $300' each after the
massage sessions.

‘Im like a Heidi Fleiss,”
Haley Robson, now 22, told

There was probable cause

lawful sex acts with.a minor

and lewd and lascivious mo-
lestation, police concluded.

The state attorney's of.
fice said questions about
the girls’ credibility led it to
take the unprecedented step
of presenting the evidence
against Epstein to a grand
jury, rather than directly
charging him.

Palm Beach Police Chief -
Michael Reiter was furious
with State Attorney Barry
Krischer, saying in a May
2006 letter that the prosecu-
tor should disqualify himself.
“I continue to find your
office’s treatment of these
cases highly unusual,” he

wrote. He then asked for and

got a federal investigation.

Epstein hired a phalanx of
high-priced lawyers— includ-
ing Harvard law professor
and author Alan Dershowitz
— and public relations people
who questioned Reiter’s com-
petence and the victims’
truthfulness.

In addition to mansions
in Palm Beach arid Manhat-
tan, Epstein owns homes in
New Mexico and the Virgin
Islands. He’s a frequent con-
tributor to Democratic Party
candidates. He also donated
$30 million to Harvard in
2003.

Former New York Gov.
Eliot Spitzer returned a
$50,000 campaign contribu-
tion from Epstein after his
indictment, then resigned
this year during his own sex
scandal. And the same Palm
Beach Police Department
that vigorously investigated
Epstein returned his $90,000
donation for the purchase of
a firearms simulator,
