have been given very long answers. I am assuming you
want narrow answers; is that true?
Q. Well, that wasn't my question, but why don't
we stay on that --
A. I mean, I could discuss that at great length.
I didn't know if that's what you wanted me to do.
Q. I would like you to give a fair answer to my
questions and I'11 let you answer your questions and if
follow up, I would ask that one at a time for the court
reporter.
I would ask that you answer the question
fairly and I'll try not to interrupt you. And then if
you would do your best to answer the questions, and as I
said, if you don't understand it, let me Know.
A. Right.
MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. I'm going to
interrupt you for just a moment. Pardon me.
There is this page that was placed in front of
me, and I don't know whether this was intended as
a delivery of something.

MR. SCOTT: No. You had asked for a copy of
the entry from Professor Dershowitz's book when
he made reference to it. I said I'd give you a
copy in the last deposition, and that's it. We

made a copy of it.
