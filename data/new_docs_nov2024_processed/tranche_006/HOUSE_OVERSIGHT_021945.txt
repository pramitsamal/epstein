Q. As a prosecutor, did you ever in a

prosecution against one person successfully introduce

into evidence that somebody else had taken the Fifth?

MR. SCAROLA: In a criminal case?

MR. SIMPSON: In a criminal case, yeah.

of them I was in the general crimes units in the

So as sitting here today, I can't recall a
circumstance where in that criminal case I was
able to do that. The standards for using it in a
Civil case would be much, much broader.

MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike nonresponsive

portion of the answer.

Q. And is the 11th Circuit case you're referring
