JAMES PATTERSON

Epstein prefers diminutive women, but Nadia is tall. She’s
rail-thin and blond like the sun, with glowing skin, a wide smile,
and sky-high cheekbones.

On a good day, she could pass for a Bond girl—a woman
caught up in a web of crime and intrigue. But of course, that's

exactly what she is.

In certain circles, the academics and the women in Epstein’s
orbit are almost a joke. In a 2003 profile of him, New York maga-
zine quotes Harvard professors (“He is amazing”), Princeton
professors (“He changed my life”), MIT professors (“If 1 had acted
upon the investment advice he has given me over the years, I'd
be calling you from my Gulfstream right now”), and other lumi-
naries, up to and including Bill Clinton.

“Pye known Jeff for fifteen years,” says Donald Trump.
“Terrific guy; he’s a lot of fun to be with.”

No one knew then that someday Trump would run for presi-
dent. (When he does, he'll attack Hillary Clinton for Bill Clinton's
own entanglements with Epstein.) But Trump’s already ahead of
the curve in that he ends up severing his ties to Epstein well
before the police or the media get wind of Epstein’s penchant for

underage girls.

He does this because he finds out that in their endless hunt ~
for “masseuses,” Epstein’s procurers have been prowling around —

Trump’s estate in Palm Beach.
