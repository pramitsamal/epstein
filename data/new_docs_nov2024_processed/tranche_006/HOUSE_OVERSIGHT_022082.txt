Robert Meister: 1985

obert Meister, the vice chairman of a giant insurance bro-
kerage and consulting firm called Aon, met Jeffrey Epstein
in the mid-eighties, aboard a flight from New York to
Palm Beach. Both men were flying first class. Each one thought
___ the other looked familiar. They talked in the course of that flight,
and Meister filed the conversation away, only to recall it in 1989.
At that time, Les Wexner, who was Meister’s friend and a client
| of Meister’s insurance company, was complaining to him about

c the people managing his money.

Wexner was a billionaire, but for all his wealth, his finances
q wete in a tangle. Maybe Epstein could help. And perhaps Epstein
would also be grateful for the introduction. Hard as it is to believe,
“there’s evidence to suggest that Epstein really had spent the last of
his last Bear Stearns bonus—along with his share of the money he'd
Recovered for Ana Obregon —and was broke, again, at the time.
