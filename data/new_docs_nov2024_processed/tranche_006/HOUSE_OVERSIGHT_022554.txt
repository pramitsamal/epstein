ENFORCEMENT

What Does DOJ Consider When
Deciding Whether to Open an
Investigation or Bring Charges?

Whether and how DOJ will commence, decline,
or otherwise resolve an FCPA matter is guided by the
Principles of Federal Prosecution in the case of individu-

DOJ Principles of Federal Prosecution

The Principles of Federal Prosecution, set forth in
Chapter 9-27.000 of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual,” pro-
vide guidance for DOJ prosecutors regarding initiating
or declining prosecution, selecting charges, and plea-bar-
gaining. The Principles of Federal Prosecution provide that
prosecutors should recommend or commence federal pros-
ecution if the putative defendant's conduct constitutes a
federal offense and the admissible evidence will probably be
sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction unless (1) no
substantial federal interest would be served by prosecution;
(2) the person is subject to effective prosecution in another
jurisdiction; or (3) an adequate non-criminal alternative to

prosecution exists. In assessing the existence of a substantial

federal interest, the prosecutor is advised to “weigh all rel-
evant considerations,’ including the nature and seriousness
of the offense; the deterrent effect of prosecution; the per-
son’s culpability in connection with the offense; the per-
son’s history with respect to criminal activity; the person’s
willingness to cooperate in the investigation or prosecu-
tion of others; and the probable sentence or other conse-
quences if the person is convicted. The Principles of Federal
Prosecution also set out the considerations to be weighed
when deciding whether to enter into a plea agreement with
an individual defendant, including the nature and serious-
ness of the offense and the person’s willingness to cooperate,
as well as the desirability of prompt and certain disposition

of the case and the expense of trial and appeal.”
