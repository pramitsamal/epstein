This is true, but is not limited to Bill Clinton or the Democrats. It permeates the top levels of most, if not all
govts, as well as the Vatican, and includes all parties. Watch the following documentary prepared by the BBC
for The Discovery Channel. It was pulled at the last moment due to pressure from high levels of the US govt.
Listen for the Republican names. Then share it everywhere! http://youtu.be/vBSIDQtSDwe

Watch this one for the international factor.

Bill Clinton is a pervert and Hilary allows him to prey on women and Children. Let us get rid of all the
Democrats who have all become communists and liars.
