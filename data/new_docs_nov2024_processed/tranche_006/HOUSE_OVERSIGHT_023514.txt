what Nicole Bacharan, a social scientist, calls “the one-man soap
opera.”

These were more than peccadilloes. But sharp elbows were needed to
shift France from sleepwalk mode.

Only in recent weeks has the distance traveled come into focus:
France, reintegrated in 2009 into the command structure of NATO,
spearheading the United Nations-backed NATO military operation in

a navel-gazing Germany unprepared to lead despite its power and
impatient with Adenauer’s Western anchoring. It also demonstrated
France’s break under Sarkozy from the posturing Gaullist notion of a
French “counterweight” to America. These are seismic European
shifts.

Sarkozy’s activism. Nor has a compensatory urge after France took
