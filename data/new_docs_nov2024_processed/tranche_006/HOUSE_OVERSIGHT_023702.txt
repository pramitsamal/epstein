The insider with an outside view

STRATEGIST, BANKER AND AUTHOR HAS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF CHINA — AND ITS LEADERS

By ANDREW MOODY

obert Lawrence Kuhn says
the West often doesn’t
understand the Chinese
leadership’s key priorities
for China. The 67-year-old American
is seen by many as one of the few
figures outside the world’s second-
largest economy who actually does.

He is regarded as a knowledgeable
insider, having been an adviser to
a number of leading Chinese bod-
ies since the late-1980s and knowing
many of the country’s top political
figures personally.

“There is rarely alignment between
what topics China’s leaders think are
important about China and what
the world thinks,” says Kuhn, also
an international corporate strate-
gist and investment banker. “Under-
standing China requires knowing the
difference.”

He was speaking recently in the
five-star Grand Hyatt hotel in central
Beijing, which is his home for 90 days
a year. The rest of the time he divides
between his three homes in the Unit-
ed States and traveling elsewhere.

“They treat me very well here.
Even when I travel around China, I
keep a room here,” he says.

The hotel is well placed near to
China’s seat of government around
Tian’anmen Square where he has an
extensive network of contacts.

His latest book, How China’s Lead-
ers Think: The Inside Story of China’s
Past, Current and Future Leaders,
which is now out in paperback and
more than 500 pages, goes into
extensive detail about those who
have the responsibility for shaping
modern China.

Kuhn, who cuts a dapper figure,
says many in the West often have an
outdated view about modern Chi-
nese leaders.

“The reality is that China’s leaders
are meritocratic,” he says.

“Many have strong academic back-
grounds from top universities and
all have significant experience, often
having run two or more provinces or
major municipalities as Party secre-
tary, governor or mayor.”

Kuhn, who is also a new China
Daily columnist, is much in demand
from major news organizations
around the world, including TV
appearances on BBC, CNBC, Eurone-
ws and Bloomberg TV, and says he
has had complete freedom to express
his opinions.

“T have written three books about
China, dozens of articles and col-
umns; I’ve produced two major TV
documentaries about China and
given scores of media interviews —
and never has anyone in China even
requested to censor anything I’ve
published or broadcast outside of
China,” he says.

Some in the West, however, have
accused him of being too much of an
insider and not giving the full picture
about China because he was too close
to the leadership.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn says China's growth is good for the world, but it cannot save the world.

“T deem it vital, considering Chi-
na’s importance in the world, that
China’s leaders become more known
to the world, and known not just via
sound-bites and photo ops, but by
seeing them up-close as real people
— hearing their own words, listen-
ing to their stories, getting their ways
of thinking. I’m pleased to facilitate
some of this,” he says.

“T also offer my own analysis. As
for my accuracy and understand-
ing, readers or viewers can judge for
themselves.”

Kuhn, who was born in New York,
began his career as a scientist. After
studying biology at John Hopkins
University, he did a doctorate in
anatomy and brain research at the
University of California at Los Ange-
les in the 1960s. Brain science and
consciousness remain major inter-
ests of his.

His first involvement in China was
through the scientific community in
the late-1980s when he worked with
scientists reforming China’s research
and technology base. He received an
invitation from Song Jian, then a
State councilor and chairman of the
State Science and Technology Com-
mission.

At the time he was developing a
parallel business career and became
president of The Geneva Companies,
a leading US mergers and acquisi-
tions company, which he eventually

sold to Citigroup in 2000.

At the same time he was cement-
ing links with leading business and
political figures in China.

His organization, The Kuhn Foun-
dation, with CCTV (China Central
Television), produced the documen-
tary In Search of China for PBS in the
US, which was broadcast in 2000.

He is now working on a new five-
part series China’s Challenges, which
will be broadcast in China in the
autumn and syndicated to PBS sta-
tions in the US next year.

Perhaps Kuhn’s most significant
project was writing a biography of
former president Jiang Zemin, which
was the best-selling book in China
in 2005.

How China’s Leaders Think was
based on interviews with more than
100 leading Chinese political figures,
some of whom he has known for
more than a decade.

“I know many personally and have
worked with several for a number of
years. When you hear them speak
over a period of time, it gives you
a sense of their personalities and
character as well as their intellec-
tual capabilities, leadership style and
political progress,” he says.

Kuhn sometimes likes to invoke
humor to explain why there is some-
times friction between Chinese and
American leaders.

“Some people think it is because

of ideological, historical or cultural
reasons that we have communica-
tion problems. As I once pointed out,
perhaps it’s because China’s leaders,
the members of the Politburo Stand-
ing Committee, were trained as engi-
neers, and most American politicians
were trained as lawyers. Maybe the
problem is that lawyers and engi-
neers can’t talk to one another!”

Kuhn says the main focus in the
West is often the Chinese economy
and whether it will continue to
motor ahead.

“China should have 10 to 20 more
years of what we should still call rela-
tively high growth, driven by con-
tinuing the country’s unprecedented
urbanization and modernization.

“Growth rates will naturally ease
from reform’s historic averages —
probably to 6 to 8 percent per annum
— which is less than we are used to,
but which may be optimal because
China can more effectively deal with
its most severe problems, particu-
larly economic and social imbalances
and sustainable development.

“However, China’s economy is frag-
ile, vulnerable to exogenous shock.
China’s growth is good for the world,
but it cannot ‘save the world?” he
says.

Kuhn says there is often a dan-
ger of China being misrepresented
because it is seen through a narrow
perspective.

Food: “| eat tofu all the time. | appreci-
ate the unbelievably different textures.”

“Western media takes China’s very
real problems and reports them as if
they were, say, 80 percent of China’s
story. I take the same problems —
which are genuine and often intrac-
table — and they consist of, say, 35
percent of my work,” he says.

“Tt is not that Western media is
conspiratorially biased or always
anti-China, it is that they often do
not provide proper and sufficient
context,” he says.
