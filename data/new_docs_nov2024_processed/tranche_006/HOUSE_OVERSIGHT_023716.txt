Quest: Do you
believe that
there’s a shift in
perspective in this,
this dinner shifted
things?

RLK: I believe
there has been a
shift; I wouldn't
tell you the dinner
did it, but over
time, there is
recognition that
this time is
different.

Quest: Thank you,
sir. Next time,
when it’s different,
you'll come back
and tell us.

RLK: Absolutely.
Quest: Okay, good.

Good to see you;
thank you.
