To identify potential gaps in a financial institution's AML Compliance Program, regulatory enforcement actions for
AML deficiencies against other (similar) financial institutions should be reviewed to identify the specific violations and
related action steps. This enables financial institutions to recognize and correct any potential weaknesses of their
own before their next regulatory examination.
