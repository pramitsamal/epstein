Corruption in Russia is pervasive and is an obstacle to foreign
investment and ultimately to any political or economic progress in the
country. But with American blood and treasure safeguarding some of
the most corrupt governments in the world in Afghanistan and Iraq,
focusing on Russia’s real and serious corruption in a way that could
endanger America’s relationship with this important power is hard to
justify.

Notwithstanding predictions of America’s decline, the United States
is still the world’s greatest power and can remain so for quite some
time. However, as other powers rise, and as America becomes
increasingly preoccupied with its economic future, the margin for
error is shrinking. The United States faces critical choices—and it
needs leaders able to make them.

Dimitri K. Simes is the president of The Nixon Center.
