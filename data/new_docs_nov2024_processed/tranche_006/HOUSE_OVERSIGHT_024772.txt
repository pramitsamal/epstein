Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

products industries, especially as companies from those industries look to enter the cannabis industry,
through acquisition or by other means.

As demonstrated by the more than $2.0 billion raised by publicly traded and private cannabis-
related companies in 2017, capital continues to be available to support the growth of the industry.
In the public markets, we believe that Canadian stock markets will continue to be the most receptive
globally (until more progress is made in the United States toward federal legalization of cannabis).

Although capital continues to be available for select issuers in both the public and private markets,
we believe that the cannabis industry will continue to face a large funding gap for the foreseeable
future, driven by the lack of institutional investors. However, we believe a growing number of retail,
institutional and family office investors will support the industry in 2018 and beyond.
