Global Landscape (Azer)

2

While the global regulatory landscape varies, the CBD category outside of the U.S. has

been evolving rapidly, with more change likely to come with the WHO's current evaluation
of CBD, as well as its recent addition to the EU's Novel Food Catalogue. In Europe, CBD
products are now widely available in markets like the U.K., Italy and Switzerland, though
regulations vary with Italy allowing for “cannabis light products, with allowable THC of as
much as 0.6%, while in Switzerland CBD products can have as much as 1% THC, and are
classified as a tobacco substitute. In Latin America, hemp has been in production since the
1500s is also rapidly expanding their regulatory frameworks around marijuana and hemp.
Canadian licensed producers have been actively entering the market in Latin America to
capitalize on this evolving opportunity, including Canopy Growth, Tilray, Aurora and Cronos.

Regulatory Outlook (Eric Assaraf - Cowen Washington Research Group)

The 2018 Farm Bill declassifies industrial hemp as a Schedule | substance, shifts regulatory
authority from the DEA to the Department of Agriculture, and provides autonomy for
states to regulate the industry. However, the new law does not change the FDA's oversight
authority over CBD products and FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has made it clear that
his agency will continue to step in when certain health claims are made. Additionally, FDA
has stated that CBD cannot be added to food products sold across state lines or marketed
as a dietary supplement, regardless of whether it is hemp-derived. The FDA will explore
new pathways for CBD to be sold legally; however, it seems clear that there will be a period
of regulatory uncertainty over CBD products at the state and federal level.
