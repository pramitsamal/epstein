the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or on Iran,
there are issues he cannot avoid. He may,
however, choose to raise them in private
talks with Israeli leaders rather than in
public. His message is expected to be
twofold: Israel should not delay in granting
statehood to the Palestinians, however
painful that choice may be, and it should be
careful not to make an eternal enemy of
Iran. Both conflicts have the potential to
isolate Israel internationally and threaten its
long-term interests, if not its actual
existence.

In his first term of office, Obama resisted
Netanyahu’s pressure to wage war on Iran.
This was no more than a semi-success,
however, since he managed to blunt
Netanyahu’s belligerence only by imposing
on Iran a raft of sanctions of unprecedented
severity. They have halved Iran’s oil
exports, caused its currency to plummet
and inflation to gallop, severed its relations
with the world’s banks and inflicted severe
hardship on its population.

The key question today is this: What are
Obama’s intentions? Is he seeking to bring
down Iran’s Islamic regime, as Israel
would like, or is he simply seeking to limit
its nuclear ambitions? If ‘regime change’ is
his aim then sanctions will have to be
tightened even further and extended
indefinitely. But if Obama’s aim 1s to strike
a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme
then he must give it at least some of what it
