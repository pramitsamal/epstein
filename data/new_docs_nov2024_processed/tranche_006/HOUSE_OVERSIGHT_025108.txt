showing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will

enable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.)

Patrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding
sleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the “purpose” of sleep and dreams, as well
as engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses).

Attached is Patrick’s quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017,

especially 2015-2017).

You’d enjoy speaking with him, if you want.
Love to do this series together with you.
Much appreciate and warm regards,

Robert
