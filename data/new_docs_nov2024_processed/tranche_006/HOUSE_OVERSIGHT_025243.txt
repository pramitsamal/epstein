So, how tight is US fiscal policy supposed to get next year?

Very, if you look at what is supposed to happen according to current law. In the chart, we show the annual change in the budget
deficit over the last 25 years. The impact of all provisions scheduled to expire and kick in during 2013 would be very large. But
if Congress and the President elect to extend current tax rates, retain lower payroll tax rates and extended jobless benefits, etc,
the adjustment would not be as big, and only reflect expiration of Recovery Act provisions, the recently passed Budget Control
Act, and some other smaller provisions. There are of course plenty of permutations in between.

What direction is the Congress heading, and what did Larry Summers and Brad DeLong have to say about this recently?
Political outcomes this fall will affect what Congress does, but I get the sense that they will punt fiscal adjustments into the
future if they can, and impose austerity of no more than 1% of GDP in 2013. Ifso, Congress can point to a March 2012 paper
by Summers and DeLong as justification. The bottom line from the paper: don’t tighten fiscal policy when interest rates are
near zero. The authors assert that (a) additional government spending can ease the long-term budget constraint in conditions
similar to today’s, and (b) tightening policy now would risk permanent loss of human capital, lower labor productivity growth
and lower trend growth. They have held these views for a while; the paper appears designed to convince others.

Advocates for more fiscal and monetary stimulus often point to the charts below. Rising Federal debt has not resulted in higher
interest rates, so why not keep borrowing more? As for the Fed, balance sheet expansion prevented deflation and hasn’t resulted
in an inflationary surge (core inflation measured over 3 months just came in below 2%), so why not keep doing it? Aren’t
these charts amazing?

They are amazing, but no one knows how long they can be sustained. Even Summers and DeLong concede that “even if it is
granted that the stimulus can be both timely and temporary, the question of how large it can be while preserving these attributes
remains for future research”. If one of these trends could not be sustained, my guess is that it would be fiscal constraints rather
than monetary ones. While it’s great to see rising Federal debt not adversely affecting Treasury markets, the chart on the left
reminds me of The Day of the Triffids.
