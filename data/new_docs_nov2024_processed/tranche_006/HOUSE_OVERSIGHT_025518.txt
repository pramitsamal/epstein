As Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-
establishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but
admit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims.

In this week’s issue, the left-wing German weekly Sern articulates the greatest fear of the European
establishment: that Bannon “could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric.”
Many thought that the reign of the “Dark Lord” had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left
first the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that
Bannon’s adversaries had underestimated him, because he is “‘as dangerous as ever,” he confesses.

Kramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon’s ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by “frenetic
applause” in his recent address before France’s National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his
“impressive potential,” which the writer describes as “dangerous.”

In the mind of his audience, Bannon is something of a miracle-worker, Stamper notes, having “done the
impossible” by bringing Donald Trump into the White House.

The reason Bannon is dangerous, Kramper continues, is because he “lays out the political program of a
worldwide right: He has already conquered the USA; now Europe and then the whole world will follow.”
