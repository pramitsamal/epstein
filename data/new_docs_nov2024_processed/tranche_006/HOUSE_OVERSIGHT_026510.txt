Hi Larry,

Thank you very much for taking the meeting this morning. I’m glad you found it worthwhile, and I agree with
you that Adam Friedman’s commitment to the project is impressive.

I AM serious about working on this---it’s a nice opportunity to make important practical use of some
interesting theory. Voting rules may seem nerdy and dry, but they can make an enormous difference to actual
politics

The formal argument that RCV promotes centrism better than the current system (plurality rule) is
straightforward. Suppose that most voters vote ideologically in the sense that the closer a candidate is to their
own position on the left-right spectrum, the more like they are to vote for him. Then under majority rule (my
favorite voting system)---in which voters rank candidates and the winner is the candidate who beats all other in
pairwise comparisons----the winner will be the median voter’s favorite candidate ----- in other words, the most
centrist candidate gets elected (this assumes that there are enough candidates running so that there is one who
is reasonably close to the median voter). Now observe that RCV is in between majority rule and plurality rule,
and so will promote centrism better than plurality rule.

Best wishes, Eric

It was fun and interesting.

I admire your friends determination.

Are you serious about working on this?

Has anyone done a full analysis of this and polarization.

Seems like on one hand it might encourage Ralph Nader cuz he d get more first round votes and not elect
George bush. This might be bad.
