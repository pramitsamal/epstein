HOST: Now from Beijing, Robert
Lawrence Kuhn is a long-time
advisor to China's leaders and the
author of “How China's Leaders
Think”. Thank you so much for
joining us. We appreciate it. Your
reaction to Jack Ma's prediction and
do you agree?

RLK: The public stance of China has
to be strong. The legitimacy of the
government and of the Communist
Party is based on two primary
factors. One is the economic
development.

RLK: China is celebrating this year
40 years of reform and opening up
really having created an economic
miracle, an astonishing 50 times
increase of GDP per capita. So that
has been terrific. The second area is
national pride and national
rejuvenation. And frankly, China as
almost every other country, if the
two come into conflict, the latter
has to prevail, especially in China
with a history of 100 years of
bullying, as they say, by foreign
powers, mostly Western, and then
of course Japan.
