HOST: So, if China is sending these
signals then, Robert, is there a
chance that China would actually
come to the table and continue to
have these trade talks as they've
been scheduled for the coming
days?

RLK: Unlikely that the top trade
negotiator would come under these
circumstances, because then it
looks like they're coming under the
threat of a gun to their head, an
analogy that has been used.
Possibly that a lower level
delegation would come. It's
unlikely though that we'll see any
real movement before the midterm
elections.
