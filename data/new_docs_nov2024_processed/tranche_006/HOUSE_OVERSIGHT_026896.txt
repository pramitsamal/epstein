growth has not signified an imminent peak in the S&P 500 historically. In fact, about 3/4ths of market
peaks occurred more than two years after the peak in the growth rate of earnings. Moreover, stock
market returns have remained healthy during this period, with high odds of a positive outcome over
the subsequent 6-24 months (see Exhibit 1). In short, the market ultimately follows the path of
earnings and while their growth rate may be slowing, their absolute level is still rising.

Inflation and Interest Rates

Inflation data has remained at relatively low levels for all of 2018, as shown in Exhibits 2 and 3. In
fact, some of the most recent data released in October have ticked slightly lower. Average hourly
earnings dropped to 2.8% from the prior month’s level of 2.9%. Headline CPI dropped to 2.3% from
2./% and Core CPI ex-food and energy remain at a low 2.2%, unchanged from the prior month. The
Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation indicator, Core PCE, also remains low at 2.0% which is in line
with the Federal Reserve’s target, and unchanged from the prior month.

While 10-year Treasury yields have risen by 0.76% (or 76 basis points) over the course of 2018, we
do not think the resulting 3.2% yield is enough to derail US economic growth. Keep in mind that most
of the recent increase since late August was due to stronger real growth rather than runaway inflation
expectations. We expect interest rates to range between 3.0% and 3.5% in 2019 with a midpoint of
3.25%, barring any major geopolitical conflicts such as one between US and China and or escalating
conflicts in the Middle East.
