Composition of a pilot
team

- Build an initial software infrastructure for testing
benchmark problems, and to create a common
methodological ground

The pilot team should consist of a scientific board, including a
mutually compatible sub-set of contemporary thinkers in the
field. Its core should consist of a new generation of researchers
that have the resources and impetus to work full-time on the
design, implementation and publication of the project’s
infrastructure. The initial team size should not be large, but
agile and effective (I would suggest about five permanent
researchers, about the same number of dedicated software
developers, and 2-3 slots for visiting scientists at a time).

The initial duration should be about 2.5 years, followed be an
evaluation, and a possible continuation of similar length.

Possible candidates for the scientific board include (in no
particular order) Paul Rosenbloom (who worked with Alan
Newell on the cognitive architecture Soar, and now started a
new architecture), John Sowa (well-known for his
groundbreaking work in semantic networks), Ben Goertzel
(designer of the cognitive architecture OpenCog), Luc Steels (an
Al researcher studying the emergence of natural language in
communities of software agents), Jerome Feldman (who
devised building blocks for a Neural Theory of Language),
Stephen Pinker (who thought much about the relationship
between language and mental representation), Stephen
Kosslyn (an expert on the psychology of mental
representation), Daniel Dennet, Cristiano Castelfranchi (an Al
researcher specializing on mental representations of intentions
and social context), and many others.

The project should start out with a number of kickoff
meetings to invite the interaction between suitable candidates,
and the formation of a core group. The eventual pilot team
could be located in many possible places, however, the project
should be able to draw on the vicinity of academic and other
infrastructure, and the influence of a creative environment.

About me VJoscha Bach):

Driven by an interest to learn hot the mind works, I studied philosophy
and psychology, graduated in computer science/artificial intelligence, lead
several small academic research groups, built the cognitive architecture
MicroPsi and obtained a PhD in cognitive science. I co-founded a couple of
startup companies in Berlin, but turned back towards academia to
contribute to the question of how to build a mind.
