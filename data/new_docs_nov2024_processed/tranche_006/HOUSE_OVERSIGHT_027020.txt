e Israel, has also been experiencing its own
tremors of change.

e Inthe summer of 2011, the people of Israel
took to the streets... demanding a more equal
allocation of the burden.

e Just last month, 53 new, fresh members of the
Knesset were sworn in, about half the serving
members of Knesset ... (Present company
included!)... were out.

e That is what | call democracy in action.
e Ademocracy lam proud of.
e Ademocracy you can be proud of.

e | am confident that Prime Minister Netanyahu
will lead his new government with the same
dedication and responsibility which he led the
last.

e Ladies and gentlemen,
