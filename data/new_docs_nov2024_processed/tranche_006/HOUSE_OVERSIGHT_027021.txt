e | was born 71 years ago, at the height of World
War Il; the Nazi crematoria in Europe were
working day and night.

e And now... in 2013, | am ending my tenure as
the Minister of Defense of a strong,
independent Jewish state.

e Look at what we — as a nation — have
achieved... Who would have believed it then?

o Today we have an agile and adaptive high-
tech and export oriented economy.

o A Start-up culture flourishes on an
eruption of talent and an underlying
entrepreneurial spirit.

e | am optimistic, and my vision for Israel is clear:

e Astrong, self-confident, thriving Jewish,
democratic state, living in peace and security
with its neighbors.

e An exemplary state and world leader in
science, technology, education and culture.
