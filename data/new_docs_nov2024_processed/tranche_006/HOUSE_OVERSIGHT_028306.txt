Cadogan Tate Sponsors ‘New Sensations’ Art Exhibition
(PRWEB) October 17, 2010

Cadogan Tate, the world class art moving, storage and shipping specialist in contemporary art, has sponsored the
‘New Sensations 2010’ exhibition for UK art students. Organised by Channel 4 and The Saatchi Gallery, this
prestigious event aims to discover the most imaginative and talented artists graduating from BA and MA courses
in the UK and to support students leaving art college.

A total of 20 students were shortlisted to present their work in the exhibition. This is being held at Boswall House,
2 Cornwall Terrace - a magnificent 18th century building off Regent’s Park - from 14th to 20th October. The event
forms part of ‘The House of the Nobleman’, under the curatorship of Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria
Golembiovskaya.

Four of the finalists in New Sensations 2010 - Pablo Wendel, Katie Surridge, Nika Neelova and Ula Wiznerowicz -
have each been given a bursary to develop a new work for the exhibition. A short film about each of them was
aired on Channel 4 in early October.

Stephen Glynn, Cadogan Tate’s Fine Art Director, comments: “We are delighted to be the sponsors of this
important exhibition, which showcases the talent of some remarkable young artists. We have spent many years
transporting and storing the world's most precious contemporary art for leading museums, galleries and
collectors. It therefore seemed very appropriate that we should support and encourage the UK’s leading art
students through this exciting event.”
