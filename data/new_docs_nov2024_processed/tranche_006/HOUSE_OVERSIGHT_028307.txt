ARTINFO UK's Guide to Frieze Week 2010
Posted: October 12, 2010 03:11 PM

Frieze Week is upon us! Europe's largest contemporary art fair has staked its tent in Regent's Park, bringing with it
an estimated $375 million in work by brand-name artists and emerging talents alike, and London is seething with
exhibitions and events to welcome the collectors, tastemakers, and various art grandees descending on the city.
What to see? Where to go? ARTINFO UK has a few recommendations.

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14

You've done Tate Britain, do you really need to go to Tate Modern? Of course you do. First, the newly opened
Gauguin exhibition is stunning and simply impossible to miss (it has been described by the Times as the show of
the season -- in fact of the whole year). Second, the new commission by Ai Weiwei, was recently unveiled in
Turbine Hall. You can then head north to enjoy Fergus Henderson's English cuisine at St. John Bar & Restaurant in
Smithfield, before wandering to ROKEBY for their exhibition of German-born, London-based artist Bettina Buck.

Today is also a good day to see The House of the Noble Man, an exhibition curated by artist Wolfe von
Lenkiewicz and Russian curator Victoria Golembiovskayan. It includes a Cézanne, £6 million ($9.6 million) worth of
Picasso, as well as pieces by Damien Hirst, Christian Boltanski, Andy Warhol, Gerhard Richter, and many more --
all in the historical setting of Cornwall Terrace as it overlooks Regent's Park. (This event is by appointment only at
Boswell House, 2 Cornwall Terrace, Regents Park, London NW1. To arrange a visit, register at:
