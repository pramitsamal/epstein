2 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.

Opinion of the Court

tion of a power plant in Gujarat, India. Petitioners are
local farmers and fishermen and a small village. They
allege that the power plant has polluted the air, land, and
water in the surrounding area. Petitioners sued the IFC
for damages and injunctive relief in Federal District
Court, but the IFC claimed absolute immunity from suit.
Petitioners argued that the IFC was entitled under the
IOJIA only to the limited or “restrictive”? immunity that
foreign governments currently enjoy. We agree.

In the wake of World War II, the United States and
many of its allies joined together to establish a host of new
international organizations. Those organizations, which
included the United Nations, the International Monetary
Fund, and the World Bank, were designed to allow mem-
ber countries to collectively pursue goals such as stabiliz-
ing the international economy, rebuilding war-torn na-
tions, and maintaining international peace and security.

Anticipating that those and other international organi-
zations would locate their headquarters in the United
States, Congress passed the International Organizations
Immunities Act of 1945, 59 Stat. 669. The Act grants
international organizations a set of privileges and immun-

property taxes. 22 U.S. C. §§288a(c), 288c.

The IOJA defines certain privileges and immunities by
reference to comparable privileges and immunities enjoyed
by foreign governments. For example, with respect to
customs duties and the treatment of official communica-
tions, the Act grants international organizations the privi-
leges and immunities that are “accorded under similar
circumstances to foreign governments.” §288a(d). The
provision at issue in this case provides that international
organizations “shall enjoy the same immunity from suit
