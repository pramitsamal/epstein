make future projects that much more likely. If | can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling these
coffers, | will be that much more able to keep working.

lam also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help
you have offered to give in bringing them around. | have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten
funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test,
that video in schools as | proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where |
could also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their
character criteria more fully, including the third of the poems Id originally proposed and that Joe
Biden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the
platform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building
literacy and character in the schools.

It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it’s always annoying but | always learn.

With abundant gratitude,
Lisa
