We can only speculate why Obama has such difficulty in effectively
using the U.S. military as an instrument of national purpose.
Winston Churchill said, “In critical and baffling situations, it is
always best to return to first principle and simple action.”

What is Obama’s first principle regarding the application of the use
of force in the international arena? He seems to possess no abiding
strategic framework about that preeminent presidential responsibility.
He makes no clear connection between the use of force and vital U.S.
national interests.

Thus, he recklessly withdraws from Iraq, imprudently escalates in
Afghanistan and unwisely intervenes in Libya. One can only wonder
and worry what he will do if and when he confronts the next crisis
which could involve committing American men and women to
combat.

Robert D. Blackwill is Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow for U.S.
foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He served as
deputy national security adviser for strategic planning, ambassador
to India and presidential envoy to Iraq in the George W. Bush
administration.
