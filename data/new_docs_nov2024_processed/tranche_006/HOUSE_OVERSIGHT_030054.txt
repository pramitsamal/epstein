“The End of History and the Last Man” testified to this sense of
triumph and historical duty.

Such a conjuncture set the stage for a new wave of imperialism
(though the reluctance to use the word remained). In doing so, it was
bound to affect interpretations of the old imperialism, which was now
extolled for spreading economic progress, the rule of law, and science
and technology to countries that would never have benefited from
them otherwise.

Foremost among the new generation of revisionist historians was
Niall Ferguson of Harvard University, whose television series, based
on his new book “Civilization: The West and the Rest,” has just
started showing in Britain. In its first episode, Ferguson appears amid
the splendid monuments of China’s Ming Dynasty, which, in the 15th
century, was undoubtedly the greatest civilization of the day, with its
naval expeditions reaching the coasts of Africa. After that, it was all
downhill for China (and “the rest”) and all uphill for the West.
Ferguson snazzily summarizes the reasons for this reversal in six
“killer apps:” competition, science, property rights, medicine, the
consumer society and the work ethic. Against such tools — unique
products of Western civilization — the rest had no chance. From such
a perspective, imperialism, old and new, has been a beneficent
influence, because it has been the means of spreading these “apps” to
the rest of the world, thereby enabling them to enjoy the fruits of
progress hitherto confined to a few Western countries.
Understandably, this thesis has not met with universal approbation.
The historian Alex von Tunzelmann accused Ferguson of leaving out
all of imperialism’s nasty bits: the Black War in Australia, the
German genocide in Namibia, the Belgian exterminations in the
Congo, the Amritsar Massacre, the Bengal Famine, the Irish potato
famine, and much else.
