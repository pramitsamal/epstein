good one — 18 years. (She spoke to me and said, “I love Jeffrey”)’.
The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein’s celebrity friends including
the business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and magician David

Copperfield, referred to as ‘Magic David’.

The sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein’s massages, many of which were

One message left for Epstein reads: ‘She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.’

Last night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers are
included in the logs.

One girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about Epstein.
A man listed only as Darren said: ‘I have no comment to make on that.’

Today, Prince Andrew was embroiled in further controversy as it was revealed Kazakhstan had
asked for his help in recruiting investors to the country.

The plea came after the former Soviet Republic's President's son-in-law had bought the Prince's
former marital home for £3million above the asking price.

Timur Kulibayev paid £15million for Sunninghill Park but it has remained empty and has been
allowed to fall into disrepair.

Last year the Prince told Hello! magazine: 'It was like any property deal between friends.'

Yesterday he attempted to perform business as usual as he visited an East London school and met
rail bosses in Canary Wharf.

He steadfastly ignored questions from journalists asking whether he was an ‘embarrassment to his
country’ and would resign from his trade ambassador role as he arrived for a briefing from

business executives at the headquarters of the £15billion train project Crossrail.
