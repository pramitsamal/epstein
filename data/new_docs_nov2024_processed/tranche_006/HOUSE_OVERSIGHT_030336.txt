Swiss Accounts Survey
Dear Mr Epstein,

We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in
London, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present.

It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts.

There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, UK
domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money.

We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts
contained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include:

HSBC (Suisse) SA

FAMILY INTEREST L.P.

22079

1) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money.

We will be particularly concerned with these questions:

2) Why you had Swiss accounts.
3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs.

Additionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that:

4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were
sentenced to 18 months in prison.
