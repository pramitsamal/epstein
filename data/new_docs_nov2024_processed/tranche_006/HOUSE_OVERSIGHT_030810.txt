Twilight of the Gods, part 2: Can releases of strategic oil reserves keep oil prices down for more than a few weeks?
International Energy Agency member countries agreed to release strategic petroleum reserves to bring oil prices down. They

have a lot of ammunition to do so; government-controlled oil inventories are at least 1.5 billion barrels, and so far, all they have
done is authorize the release of 60 million barrels. The timeline suggests that oil markets began focusing on the release of the
SPR after the Libyan shutdown, the lack of a sufficient OPEC supply response, and weak economic data in the US. As shown
below, oil prices have been rising since the announcement of the supply increase. Are IEA members committed to doing it
again if oil prices reach their May levels?

The problem for the IEA is that the tightness in oil markets Fost Libya OF EC spare capacity running out
is not just a sudden supply shock. As shown in the bottom P y

6.0
chart we first published in March, there was not much slack
even before the Libyan shutdown, and oil demand is expected 5.0
to rise 1-2 mm bpd as the developed and emerging world 40

continue to grow. One of our colleagues used to work at the

IEA, and in a recent piece’, argued that the impact of the SPR 3.0
release will be limited to Q3 2011, and that upside oil price 20
risks to 2012 have increased. Why? The SPR release came at a

time when OPEC tanker traffic made it clear that producing Ls

countries were having problems meeting prior pledges: “As 0.0

such, if is difficult to conclude anything except that there is Pre-crisis OPEC Pre-crisisreal Post-crisisreal 2011 additional

little or no spare capacity in the oil market’. If that’s the case sparecapacity OPEC spare = OPEC spare _—_globaldemand
. ie ; pacity : . . 2 capacity capacity (estimated)

future interventions may not have a lasting impact either. Source: J.P. Morgan SecuritiesLLC.
