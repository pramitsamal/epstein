I would request that you intervene in this matter and require that the FBI agree to a
procedure that expedites the production of the 12,000 page file. I would also request a
conference with you and/or with the specific individuals who will be responsible for discharging
the FBI’s FOIA responsibilities as to the pending Epstein request for FOIA materials so that I
can be assured that the FBI will be discharging its legal obligations without continued unlawful
and inexplicable delay.

Epstein, after 28 months, has received just over 700 pages of redacted documents out of a file of
over 12,000 pages.
