Clearly the defects in the brain’s wiring that lead to crazy theories may lead to the confirmation of
theories that are adopted by rational people. Indeed, the confirmation bias can work in contradictory
ways: confirming not only conspiracy theories but the impulse to reject them in favor of conventional
wisdom. Can this defect be corrected? Here I am reminded of a Woody Allen’s absolutely brilliant 1996
comedy “Everyone Says I Love You,” in which the once-liberal son of a New York liberal family starts
spouting conservative theories until a doctor solves the problem by restoring the proper flow of oxygen
to his brain. The movie has a happy ending when the son goes back to spouting his family’s liberal
theories. while Mr. Brotherton offers no such remedy to our brain’s defects, he does offer a thought-
provoking analysis and an appealing guide to thinking about conspiracies, real and imagined.

—Mr. Epstein most recent book is “The Annals of Unsolved Crimes.” He is currently writing a book about
Edward Snowden.
