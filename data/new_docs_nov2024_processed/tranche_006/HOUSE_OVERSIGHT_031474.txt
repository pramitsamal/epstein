Turkey coup bid: Fethullah Gulen's lawyers
fear attack on his life

e 25 minutes ago

Lawyers for US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen say they fear an attack on his life, in the wake of the failed coup
attempt on 15 July in Turkey.

Turkey has issued an arrest warrant for Mr Gulen, accusing him of orchestrating the coup attempt. It has called on the US to
extradite him.

Mr Gulen denies any involvement.

Turkey has cracked down heavily in the wake of the coup attempt. On Friday the governing AK Party ordered an internal purge
of Gulen supporters.

More than 270 people died in events surrounding the coup attempt.
