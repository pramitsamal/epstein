harsh treatment of dissents and a crackdown on journalists. While Egypt
is headed down the path of autocracy, this does not suggest the futility of
change or of promoting democracy in Egypt, nor, say, that the Arab
Spring was a failure. Autocracy will not be a permanent fix for the factors
that nourished the Arab Spring. It will work for a while, maybe even a
decade, but eventually, repression will not be enough, and the
demonstrations will begin again. A little liberty is a dangerous thing—
especially when it bears fruit. The Arab Spring in Egypt may not have
brought about democracy, but that does not mean it failed. Egypt now
knows the impact mass action can have on its government. They have seen
not one, but two governments fall as a direct result of protests and popular
action. Egypt may be moving back toward a military dictatorship, but now
the people have a taste of liberty. No matter how repressive the military
establishment decides to be, the genie is out of the bottle.
