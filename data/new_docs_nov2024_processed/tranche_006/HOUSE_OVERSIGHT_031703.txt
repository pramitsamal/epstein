inconceivable that the US will take any aggressive action
against Iran and will more likely thwart any Israeli initiative.
The US will preach the importance of negotiations up until the
production of the first Iranian nuclear weapon - and then state
that the world must learn to live with this new reality.

But this election should be a wake-up call to Jews. There is no permanent empire, nor is there
an enduring haven for Jews anywhere in the exile. The American empire began to decline in
2007, and the deterioration has been exacerbated in the last five years. This election only
hastens that decline.

Society is permeated with sloth, greed, envy and materialistic excess. It has lost its moorings
and its moral foundations.. The takers outnumber the givers, and that will only increase in
years to come.

The Occupy riots across this country in the last two years
were mere dress rehearsals for what lies ahead - years of
unrest sparked by the increasing discontent of the
unsuccessful who want to seize the fruits and the bounty of
the successful, and do not appreciate the slow pace of
redistribution.

If this election proves one thing, it is that the Old America is gone. And, sad for the world, it is

not coming back.
The problems we face today are there because the people who

work for a living are outnumbered by those who vote for a
living.
