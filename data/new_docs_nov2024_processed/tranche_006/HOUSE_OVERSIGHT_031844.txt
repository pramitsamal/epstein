denounce violence against Israel. But the symbolism of Mitchell
leaving several days before Obama's biggest week of outreach to the
region projected a vacuum of confidence that anything hopeful,
however remote, was on the horizon.

He wouldn't be leaving at this important hour if he knew there was
going to be a significant change in the administration's attitude
toward the peace process, said Middle East analyst Gregory Orfalea,
who formerly taught at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service.
He's leaving because it's status quo.

Mitchell will be replaced—in the interim by his deputy, David Hale—
and another official will take a crack at the quandary. But despite new
momentum from Netanyahu's visit next week and Obama's speech
Thursday, Mitchell's departure could signal stagnant talks for the next
several years. According to Fawaz Gerges, director of the London
School of Economics' Middle East Center, the reality is that, with
Mitchell leaving, Barack Obama basically lost the ideological battle
[over how to confront the peace process]. By now he'll have to wait
for the second term before you can get another concerted effort.
