he was unaware that commentators like me would be picky about the
lack of basic freedoms. He doesn’t care.

Indeed, that was the point. Turki — and by implication all of Saudi
Arabia — has had it with the United States. The kingdom will not be
lectured to. It is sick and tired of American favoritism to Israel — the
exuberant congressional reception for Binyamin Netanyahu, for
example — and the administration’s decision to oppose any effort in
the United Nations to create a Palestinian state. In this matter,
America is doing what Israel wants.

“In September, the kingdom will use its considerable diplomatic
might to support the Palestinians in their quest for international
recognition,” Turki wrote. “American leaders have long called Israel
an ‘indispensable’ ally. They will soon learn that there are other
players in the region — not least the Arab street — who are as, if not
more, ‘indispensable.’ The game of favoritism toward Israel has not
proven wise for Washington, and soon it will be shown to be an even
greater folly.”

This is not your usual diplomatic language — and even for Turki it is
rough. It shows, though, a not-surprising frustration in the Arab
world with American policy tethered for the moment to a quite
stubborn and unimaginative Israeli policy. Both countries are
suffering from a surfeit of democracy. Israel’s governing coalition is
held hostage by the right; America’s governing coalition is in the
same fix.

Turki does not run out of wagging fingers. He says that those who
think that the United States and Israel will determine the future of
Palestine are dead wrong. “There will be disastrous consequences for
U.S.-Saudi relations if the United States vetoes U.N. recognition of a
Palestinian state. It would mark a nadir in the decades-long
relationship as well as irrevocably damage the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process and America’s reputation among Arab nations. The
