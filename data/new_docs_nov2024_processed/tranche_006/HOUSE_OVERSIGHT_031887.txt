Mubarak family’s attempt to turn Egypt into a family possession.
The Army has ruled Egypt since the overthrow of King Farouk,
playing liberals and religious conservatives off against each other. It
looks set to go on doing that for some time to come. In Yemen,
Bahrain and Syria, the counsel of the idealists seems dark and
confused. US policy overall seems to have found the ‘sour spot’ that
is the particular curse of the Obama administration: too friendly to
the revolt to earn the trust and gratitude of the despots, too cautious
and compromising to win many friends on the street.

Overall I am more cautious than optimistic about where the Arab
Spring is headed. There is little prospect for the kind of rapid
economic growth that could improve the prospects for young
unemployed and underemployed Arabs. Foreign investment and
tourism have already been badly hit by the unrest of the last six
months, and the Arab regimes are turning to aid donors and
organizations like the IMF and the World Bank in increasing
desperation.

Culturally, many of the necessary preconditions are not in place. The
poor quality of most Arab universities, the limited access to serious
political history and discourse among all but a handful of Arab
intellectuals, the suppression of political life under past dictatorships,
the weakness of Islamic political thought in recent centuries and the
absence of a robust and deeply rooted tradition of Islamic democracy
all work against the rapid widespread development of stable liberal
democracy in the Arab world.

Putting the dark economic outlook together with the problematic
cultural and political situation makes optimism a tough position to
hold. Without in any way scanting or minimizing the idealism,
dedication and vision of the democrats rising in the Arab world
today, they still seem a long way from winning. They remind me still
of the Marquis de Lafayette during the French Revolution: they
