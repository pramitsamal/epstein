must make room for the equality of the sexes and the rights of
religious minorities. Property rights must be rooted in law and
protected by an independent judicial system. While governments
have a role in the economy, the mechanisms of the market must
ultimately be allowed to work their way.

We do not agree among ourselves about the proper sequence of these
changes. We know that in the short run, democratic voting
procedures may not produce liberal governments. We know that
demagogues and aspiring despots can use the language and even the
mechanisms of democracy to build personal dictatorships (Napoleon
III and Hugo Chavez, for example). We know that popular opinion is
sometimes more nationalistic than elite opinion and that gains for
democracy do not always lead to more foreign policy cooperation. In
most cases, progress toward stable and peaceful democratic
government comes slowly if it comes at all; even if you believe in
‘democratic peace theory, hoping that the democratization of other
countries will solve American foreign policy problems is a fool’s
game.

Yet we also know — or at least we believe — that in the long run a
more democratic world is a better if not always a safer world, and that
it would be immoral as well as impractical to stand in the way of the
changes that need to come.

If we add the conservative mission of the United States to the
revolutionary agenda, the problems of American foreign policy
become more complex still. We are trying to carry out a vast
reordering of global society even as we preserve the stability of the
international political order: we are trying to walk blindfolded on a
tightrope across Niagara Falls — while changing our clothes.

The uncertainties and risks that surround us should not be
underestimated. There has never been a worldwide revolution of this
kind before; nobody knows for sure how best to speed the plow.
