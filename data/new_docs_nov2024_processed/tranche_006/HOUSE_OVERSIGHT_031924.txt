a civil war in Syria. Israel would thus find itself fighting three battles
simultaneously. The only way to do that is to be intensely aggressive,
making moderation strategically difficult.

Israel responded modestly compared to the past after the Eilat
incident, mounting only limited attacks on Gaza against mostly
members of the Palestinian Resistance Committees, an umbrella
group known to have links with Hamas. Nevertheless, Hamas has
made clear that its de facto truce with Israel was no longer assured.
The issue now is what Hamas is prepared to do and whether Hamas
supporters, Saudi Arabia in particular, can force them to control anti-
Israeli activities in the region. The Saudis want al Assad to fall, and
they do not want a radical regime in Egypt. Above all, they do not
want Iran's hand strengthened. But it is never clear how much
influence the Saudis or Egyptians have over Hamas. For Hamas, this
is emerging as the perfect moment, and it is hard to believe that even
the Saudis can restrain them. As for the Israelis, what will happen
depends on what others decide - which is the fundamental strategic
problem that Israel has.
