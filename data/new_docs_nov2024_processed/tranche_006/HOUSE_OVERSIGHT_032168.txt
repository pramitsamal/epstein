and an Israeli long term military presence along
the River Jordan - the IDF and the
SecurityServices will be capable

of defending Israel. Moreover, I’m confident that

Staff, all former Commanders of the Central
Command( responsible for Judea and Samaria)
and all former Heads of Intelligence ,SecServices

conceivable rival and will be able to defend Israel
under all those circumstances.

bleeding State. Still,this is the vision the Israeli
extreme Right shares unknowingly with the Hamas
