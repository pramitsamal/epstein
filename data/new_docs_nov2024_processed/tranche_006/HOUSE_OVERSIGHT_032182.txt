Another point that was raised in several different forms related to
how the current Arab revolt would affect relations with major
Western countries, especially since many Western powers actively
supported the Arab autocrats who are now being challenged and, in
some cases, removed from office. Would newly liberated Arab
citizenries seek revenge against Western powers?

My impression is that this will depend on the new policies that these
Western powers adopt, rather than on what they did in the past. Most
Arabs are critical of Western powers because they unquestioningly
back Israel or support Arab autocrats. Should those policies be
moderated and replaced by more even-handed postures toward the
Middle East, newly liberated Arab citizens would probably be too
busy building their new countries to allow themselves to be distracted
by lingering resentments from the past.

What is the single most important development that could trigger
regime change in some countries now facing domestic challenges and
unrest, one person asked? Three reasons come to mind: economic
collapse could do so; or key figures in the military and security
agencies could stop protecting the regime; or strategically placed
commercial, tribal, sectarian and business leaders in society could
decide that the current course was disastrous and, in consequence,
could bring about the fall of the regime.
