this is only the first quarter of the game. if you call atime out, its on the field and done with dignity, you cant
retreat into the locker room and send a note to the opposing side. _in the next quarter she will appreciate
whatever you've said with respect and founded on strength. you care very much for this person. you might
want to demonstrate that. a note does the very opposite. . its like trump firing comey. :)

unclear if you meant you ve written notes to yourself re exit or a note you were thinking of sending - BAD
FORM if latter. you both have still not agreed the rules of the game. so difficult to play . you have laid out
- this is whati want. . but actually , how it would work , and what her freedoms are. could be . yours.. are
essential to the plan. I think much of this is your uncertainty and not hers. sorry. and yours is infectious

Ok. Best to make reversible errors
I’ve written note for exit strategy 1. Not going to send for few days.

Going to treat it all as a game till I maybe see her in Beijing and out of character ignore and look past her bad
behavior.
