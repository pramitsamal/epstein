But the piece that came out, in the March issue, still created a
sensation. It was called “The Talented Mr. Epstein” in a sly refer-
ence to Patricia Highsmith’s celebrated suspense novel The Tal-

still fresh in the minds of Vanity Fair’s readers. For Graydon
Carter, just posing the question Is Epstein some sort of scam artist,
like Ripley? had been question enough. And throughout the
wouldn't miss as they drew

their own conclusions about Epstein’s life story. It came through

clearly in the first line of the last paragraph of Ward's 7,500-word
“Many people comment there is something innocent,

piece, there were ironies readers

story:
