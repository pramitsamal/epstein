BY MR, SIMPSON:
Q. I'm -- I'm trying to close a loop here.
A. Yeah.
Q. I'm asking whether you were involved in any
other cases in which claims have been made against
Jeffrey Epstein for damages that are still active; they
have not been resolved?
A. So we are talking civil cases, unresolved
civil cases against Jeffrey Epstein right now?
Q. Unresolved cases seeking money from Jeffrey
Epstein.
MR. SCAROLA: And to the extent that that
question calls for matters that are of public
record, then, obviously, you can respond.
THE WITNESS: Right. Yeah. None.
BY MR. SIMPSON:
Q. Are there -- and I'm not asking for the name.
Are there any not of public record that --
A. What would bea not?
Q. Well, if you had made a claim that's not in
suit, for example.
A. Oh, against Jeffrey Epstein?
Q. Yes.
A. Yeah. No, I don't -- I don't think there's
anything. Yeah, no -- no claims against Epstein, right.

Q. And -- and it's true, is it not, that if
you're successful in the CVRA case, in setting aside the
nonprosecution agreement, you expect to get other
clients who will have claims against Jeffrey Epstein?
A. If we -- in civil claims?
Q. Claims for damages, claims for money from
Jeffrey Epstein.
A. That -- I mean, that starts to -- if the
nonprosecution agreement is set aside?
Q. Yes, if you're successful.
A. haven't really -- that sounds pretty
speculative. I haven't really thought about the
civil -- the focus of the CVRA case is criminal. I
haven't thought about, you know, whether, civil claims
could somehow arise out of that. I mean, we are talking
about, you know, events that took place long ago. There
would be statute of limitations issues, you know.
Whether they are viable civil claims at this point has
not been something that I have, you know, given much
thought to.

Q. Sos it your testimony then that you have

not thought about the question of whether success in the
CVRA case may or result in you obtaining additional
clients with claims for money damages against Jeffrey
Epstein?

A. Yeah. That hasn't been something that I have
focused on, no. I mean...

Q. tis -- it is correct, is it not, that you
anticipate that if you are successful in setting aside
the nonprosecution agreement, that the names of
additional victims will become known; didn't you testify
to that yesterday?

A. I-- I'm not -- I must be confused here. I
don't remember.

Q. Well, wait -- I don't want to -- you know,
let me ask the question --

A. Yeah.

Q. _-- rather than my recollection.

A. Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm not...

Q. My question is: Do you anticipate that if
you're successful in setting aside the nonprosecution
agreement, that the names of additional victims will
become known?

A. Additional Epstein victims at this point?

Q. Yes.

A. Again, it's pretty speculative. The --
the issue -- you know, the case, you know, the events
were roughly a decade ago. I mean, we are always hoping
that there might be somebody additional that would come
forward, but that hasn't been the focus of the

litigation.

Q. Whether --

A. And you always hope that there are -- yeah, I
mean, any time you file a case, ah, I hope some more,
you know, witnesses will come forward to support that
case, but that hasn't been the focus, trying to secure
additional -- additional witnesses. Thatis a
possibility, though. I mean, I think in fairness to
your question, that is a possibility that, you know,
if -- if the case attracts attention and -- and
somebody, you know, says, you know, gosh, now that I --
I -- I -- you know, I moved away to escape Epstein and
now it's safe for me to come back, or -~ or now I
realize I have a claim, that's always a possibility.

I certainly wouldn't want to suggest that,
you know, we are ruling that possibility out.

Q. And for the same reason that additional
witnesses might become available -- known, additional
clients might become known, correct?

A. That is a theoretical possibility, yes.

Q. In these four cases that you mentioned, the
three that were, which you were counsel of record and
one in which you were not, did you meet at any time in
person with the clients? And if it's different as to
some than others, tell me that, but --
