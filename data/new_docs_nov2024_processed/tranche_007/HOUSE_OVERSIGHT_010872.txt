Does that letter put Mr. Dershowitz on fair
notice that he's accused of being a sex offender
himself?
MR. SCAROLA: Objection. Repetitious. To
the extent that you can improve upon the answer,
you can improve upon the answer. If you can't,

all you need to do is say that.
THE WITNESS: I -- and I'll try to --
obviously, I want to be responsive --
BY MR. SIMPSON:
Q. Let -- let me ask --
A. ++ to your question.

Q. I'll ask you a different question.

A. I don't think that's a yes or no question
because of ~~ of you're including vague terms like fair
notice and -- and those sorts of things. So -- but go
ahead and ask your questions and I'll -- I mean, go
ahead.

. You're a former federal judge?
Right.
A former Supreme Court law -- law clerk?
Yes.
Professor at a law school?
Yes.

letter, in your opinion, does the language itself put
the recipient on notice that the recipient is accused of
abusing minors himself?

A. It puts him on notice that that is going to
be a potential subject of inquiry at the -- at the --
the deposition.

Q. So your answer then is, yes, it puts the --
the -- the person on notice; that's your reading?

A. You're -- I think you're putting words in my
mouth. You're -- you're trying to ask, you know, a
question that on the one hand, you're suggesting is
narrow, and on the other hand is broad. It -- I mean,
this is probably the simplest way to answer that
question.

If I had gotten that letter, I would have
said, schedule the deposition in the next 24 hours, and
come on down here now, and I will be available for a
week, That's what I would have said if I had gotten
that letter.

MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike as

nonresponsive.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Is it your testimony you can't answer yes or
no whether that letter, on its face, puts the recipient
on notice that the recipient is accused himself of

having abused minors? Can you answer that: Yes or no?

A. No. I think a yes-or-no answer would be
misleading, given the context of this case.

Q. You referred in your earlier testimony to --
strike that for a moment.

You referred in your earlier testimony to an

articie that appeared today regarding
Professor Dershowitz's deposition testimony, correct?

A. Idon't think so.

Q. Okay. Are you aware that -- well, perhaps it
was Miss McCawley who referred to it.

Do you recall there being a reference this

morning to an article being published about
Professor Dershowitz's testimony?

MS. McCAWLEY: Oh, I'm sorry. It was me. I
objected to the extent -- only to the extent it
revealed something public that had been stated in
public.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Okay. And I -- you recall that?

A. Yeah, I recall the objection. I think
there's an article that came out yesterday or a
communication. I -- I -- you know, I can't remember
the -- exactly where I -- I know that I received a
communication, either through publication or in some

other way from the -- from the -- you know, I became
aware that there was a statement that the -- what's the
name of the outfit? It's the Business Investor --

MR. SCAROLA: Daily Business Review.

THE WITNESS: Daily Business Review that was
stating that David Boies was saying that the
representations made by Mr. Dershowitz were
false.

MR. SCAROLA: I did just coach the witness.

I apologize.

THE WITNESS: Yeah. And, I'msorry, just for

the name of that, so...

Q. And you -- in your earlier testimony, you
referred to it -- you didn't recall the name, but you
referred to it as a reputable --

A. That's right.

Q.  -- publication?

A. That's right. That's the one we are talking
about, right.

Q. Right. And in that article it states:

McCawley, referring to our colleague,

later issued a statement on Boies's behalf
saying, because the discussions that Mr. Boies
had with Mr. Dershowitz were expressly privileged
