Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 291-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/21/2015 Page 9 of 20

30. | Another sexual encounter between me and Dershowitz happened on Epstein’s
airplane. Another girl was present on the plane with us.

31. I have recently seen a former Harvard law professor identified as Alan
Dershowitz on television calling me a “liar.” He is lying by denying that he had sex with me.
That man is the same man that I had sex with at least six times.

32. Epstein made me have sex with Prince Andrew several times. Prince Andrew,
Maxwell, and I are shown in the photograph below. I had sex with him three times, including

one orgy. I knew he was a member of the British Royal Family, but I just called him “Andy.”

33. | One day when I was in London (specifically in a townhouse that is under
Maxwell’s name), I got news from Maxwell that I would be meeting a prince. Later that day,
Epstein told me I was meeting a “major prince.” Epstein told me “to exceed” everything I had
been taught. He emphasized that whatever Prince Andrew wanted, I was to make sure he got.

34. Eventually Prince Andrew arrived, along with his security guards. The guards
then went out of the house and stayed out front in their car. It was just Epstein, Maxwell, and me

inside alone with Andy. I was introduced to the Prince, and we kissed formally, cheek to cheek.
