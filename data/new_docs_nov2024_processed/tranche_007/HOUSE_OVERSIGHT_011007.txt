acceleration = free acceleration + thrift acceleration. (4.5b)

Rates are flows divided by capital expressing them. Then define the two flows as

free growth = capital * freeacceleration, and (4.8)
thrift = capital * thriftacceleration, giving (4.9)
growth = free growth + thrift. (4.10)

These equations apply equally in continuous or discrete-period time. In the latter,
they leave the periods of acceleration and growth unspecified. Marginal or current
free growth, as with the speed ofa car, is the sum of free accelerations since some
past origin when growth was zero. So it is with current thrift. That need not place
the origin with Ancestral Eve. Surprising as it might seem in the growth age, zero
points appear to recur every few minutes at the longest. Online stock index numbers
reverse direction at least that often. They pass through zero each time. Debt claims
on the corporate sector figure to be less volatile, but equity (stock) ones outweigh
them. Then marginal free growth means accumulated free acceleration, or rise in
rate of return, since the last zero growth point no more than a few minutes ago
when return and cash flow were equal. Growth is free whenever cash flow rate rises

or holds steady.

The Charts and Tables

Mill lacked data to test whether growth tends to lead with output when it changes,
or to lag with consumption, or something else. So did all economists until national
accounts began reporting market-valued capital in 1990 or so, and reconstructing it
backward over a few decades before. The equations through (4.7) show how to test

from data in the Piketty-Zucman and Global Financial Data websites.
