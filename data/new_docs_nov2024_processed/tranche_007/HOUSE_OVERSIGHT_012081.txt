EM Growth? TABLE 1 highlights data from the 10 largest emerging mar-
kets, which account for 89.2% of the MSCI Emerging Mar-
kets Index. The growth prospects of this group appear sur-
prisingly tepid. The median real GDP growth for the next
five years is forecasted at 2.5%, while population growth is
expected to be less than 1.0%. The term “emerging markets”
was coined in the 1980s, but frankly, most of these econo-
mies have already “emerged.” The countries with the most
long-term economic growth potential are arguably those
with young, growing populations—namely, India, Indone-
sia and Malaysia. However, these countries have small eq-
uity markets that, when combined, do not even equal South
Korea's in size.

CAPE ratios are lower outside the U.S., with emerging mar-
kets even lower than those in developed markets. While we
have been more constructive in recent issues of Global Fore-
sight on non-U.S. opportunities, we believe there is limited rel-
evance of CAPE ratios when comparing the very deep, diverse
set of companies in the U.S. with most other markets. While
valuation from 30,000 feet looks better in many places, there
are reasons to discount CAPE asa reliable valuation tool when
analyzing smaller markets. As an extreme example, Russia has
the lowest CAPE ratio in the world, but its equity market is
very concentrated in commodity businesses whose earnings

are highly cyclical.

Aging Populations

China is a market that has looked attractively valued at times

relative to its growth prospects. However, China has already A major challenge South Korea and China already face, is an

aging population. Countries that are major economic powers
are aging rapidly, while most of the youth in the world is
concentrated in the poorest nations. One useful country demo-
graphic is the median age of its citizens. The U.S., with a median
age of 37.9 years (half of all Americans are 38 or older), ranks
62 out of 230 nations, making it one of the older nations in the
world, though one of the world’s younger developed markets.
Aging in the US. is dwarfed by comparison to most of Europe
and Japan. Japan and Germany have median population ages of
46.9 and 46.8, respectively. Remarkably, if people in the U.S.
ceased having kids for the next nine years, only then would we
have a median population age approaching those today in
Japan and Germany. Europe has a median age of 42.7 as a
region and is nearly five years older than the US.

had a spectacular recovery from a correction that rattled mar-
kets globally in August 2015 and again in January 2016. China
is the largest emerging market and a vital trading partner for
many other key emerging markets, such as Brazil. While Chi-
na remains an important source of long-term global economic
growth, it faces some cyclical and structural challenges that
Jimmy Chang discusses in his article.

South Korea is an emerging market that has screened well for
valuation and poorly for governance. As the second largest
emerging market after China, we believe that South Korea is
an important economy and source for potential investments.
We cover it in more detail in the articles from Michael Seo and
Dr. Mariela Vargova.
