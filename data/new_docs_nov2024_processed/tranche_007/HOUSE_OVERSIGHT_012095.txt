A “Vixing” Puzzle |

Market’s unusual lack of volatility;
Be fearful when others are greedy

ctober has historically been a spooky month in

which some of the biggest market declines took

place — the crash of 1929, 1987’s Black Monday,
the financial crisis of 2008, etc. This October, however,
there were only treats and no tricks — the biggest one-day
movement for the S&P 500 Index during the month was a
0.81% gain, and the biggest down day had a mere 0.47%
drop. That said, there was quite a bit of turbulence among
individual stocks. The Information Technology sector had
a huge month, with the so-called FANG stocks (Facebook,
Amazon, Netflix, Google) leading the way up, while some
old economy bellwethers and the much beleaguered brick
and mortar retailers took a beating. The rising hope of
U.S. tax reform and the continued strength of the global
economic expansion lifted U.S. Treasury yields as well as
commodity prices from oil to copper. The U.S. reflation
expectation also boosted the greenback. European
sovereign bond yields and the euro declined after ECB
President Draghi announced a reduction in monthly asset
purchases starting in 2018, but promised a longer
duration of QE. China completed its quinquennial
leadership transition at the conclusion of the 19th Party
Congress, which should usher in a new era with more
focus on the quality of growth over the quantity. President
Xi now awaits President Trump’s State visit to Beijing on
November 84, Investors will likely be focused on issues
ranging from trade to North Korea, though major
breakthroughs appear unlikely. Lastly, there is still one
unresolved sleeper issue that may come back to roil the
market — will a new bipartisan deal be reached in time to
fund the U.S. government beyond December 8, when the
current continuing resolution expires?
