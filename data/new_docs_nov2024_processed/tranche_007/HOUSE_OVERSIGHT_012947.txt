2.5 Integrative and Synergetic Approaches to Artificial General Intelligence 31

1. choosing an overall cognitive architecture that possesses adequate richness and flexi-
bility for the task of achieving childlike cognition.

2. Choosing appropriate AI algorithms and data structures to fulfill each of the func-
tions identified in the cognitive architecture (e.g. visual perception, audition, episodic mem-
ory, language generation, analogy...)

3. Ensuring that these algorithms and structures, within the chosen cognitive architecture,
are able to cooperate in such a way as to provide appropriate coordinated, synergetic
intelligent behavior (a critical aspect since childlike cognition is an integrated functional
response to the world, rather than a loosely coupled collection of capabilities.)

4. Embedding one’s system in an environment that provides sufficiently rich stimuli and
interactions to enable the system to use this cooperation to ongoingly, creatively develop
an intelligent internal world-model and self-model.

We argue that CogPrime
provides a viable way to address these challenges.
