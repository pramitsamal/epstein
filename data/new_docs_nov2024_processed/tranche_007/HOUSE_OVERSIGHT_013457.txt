Blythe Danner kissed me at the door
as a military-type looked on. I kept saying
to him, “Where have we met?” Nowhere.
He was astronaut Mark E. Kelly who
came with Blythe and is married to
former congresswoman _ Gabrielle
Giffords, Paltrow's second cousin. Only
I could mistake an astronaut for a movie
marketing guy.

Vanity Fair féted Scorsese and The
Film Foundation, which has saved 555

Thelma Schoonmaker were honored.
Sir Ben Kingsley, Danny Huston, Patty
Clarkson, Irwin Winkler and Giorgio
