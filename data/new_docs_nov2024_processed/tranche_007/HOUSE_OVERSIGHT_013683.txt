Mentioned briefly above was one of humankind’s beacons, Pythagoras, the
intellectual and spiritual progenitor of Plato. He taught the disciples of the
Pythagorean Brotherhood in Crotona, Italy, that reality at its deepest level was
mathematical thought. Studies there included philosophy, geometry, music and
astronomy, all at the service of achieving closer union with the Divine. Pythagoras
and his school, only his student’s writings remain, was said to be working at unifying
elements of the ancient tribal mystery cults with the observables of worldly events
through meditative, mathematical, philosophical mysticism. Knowledge was gained
through spiritual intuition made harmonious with formal systems of thought. As Plato
later said and as quoted by Thomas Heath in his 1921 History of Greek
Mathematics, about the study of the motion of stars, “...leave the heavens alone...”
because what one sees is only an approximation of the real and more perfect
mathematical structures involving points, lines and circles. To which Newton added
an elongated circle, the ellipse, and Nineteenth and Twentieth Century
mathematicians and physicists, the geometries of positively and negatively curved
space.

It is perhaps not an accident that debates about evidence for the existence
and location of God and where the ideas and structures of mathematics live and
breath generally involves a stand off between those that believe that both are out
there and can be seen, like thoughtful, humanistic actions and caring service for
needful others, versus those that feel the phenomenology of both are projections of
the psychobiologically intuitive Brain God and can be felt like an ecstatic rush of

insightful illumination.
