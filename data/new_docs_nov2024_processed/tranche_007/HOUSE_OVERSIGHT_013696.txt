nonharmonic frequency encoding parameter spaces fusing, resulting in new periods
that are the sums of their adjacent ones: period 2 + period 3 = period 5, in what is
called the “period adding route”. Technically precise classification of bifurcations
involve much more careful definitions and well studied technical constraints
involving such issues as the symmetries and dimensionality of the system of
observables, how many control parameters (“codimensions”) are required to
reasonably realize the bifurcation and the particular way the fixed points of the
system become unstable, all of which are directly explorable when the equations
are known or can be hypothetically inferred from the qualitative behavior of real

data.

We note a few examples from the wide variety of bifurcating systems that
can be found in the biomedical literature of interest for the biological sciences. With
substrate input rate as the bifurcation parameter, the phosphofructokinase regulated
glycolytic cycle in yeast extract was found to change among steady state, periodic
and period doubling (subharmonic) regimes (Boiteux et al, 1975). Transitions
between steady state, oscillatory and chaotic patterns have been reported in variety
of physiological measures in man including respiratory rhythms and circulating
blood cell concentrations over time (Mackey and Glass, 1977; Glass and Mackey,
1988 ) and models of dopamine cell dynamics (King et al, 1984). Flow rate
parameter sensitive periodic, bursting and chaotic behavior has been found in a
peroxidase-oxidase system (Olsen and Degn, 1977). A brain enzyme, substantia
nigral dopaminergic tyrosine hydroxylase, manifested different saturation and
fluctuation patterns, including bursting and periodicity, in experiments in which low
(physiological) levels of tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor were the bifurcation parameters

and adrenergic drugs were used as modulators (Mandell and Russo, 1981).

All four of the generic bifurcation routes to chaos, period doubling, changing
multifrequency (quasiperiodicity), period adding and bursting (called “intermittency”)
were observed in self-sustained oscillations induced in the neural membranes of
space clamped, giant squid axons that were immersed in a 550mM NaCl, and
electrically stimulated over changing amplitudes and frequencies (Aihara et al,

1986; Takahashi et al, 1990). With external stimulus current level as the control
