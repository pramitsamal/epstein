(Edwards and Griffith, 1997). The role of central and autonomic innervation in
cardiac interval dynamics has been explored using D2 in various ways. For
examples, the transplanted heart rhythm in man has a lower Dz than that of the
normal heart (Guzzetti et al, 1996) and general anesthesia and cholinergic (but not
B-adrenergic) blockade decreased multisystem Dz in a series of multiparameter
(respiration, mean blood pressure and heart rate) studies in piglets (Zwiener et al,
1996; Hoyer et al, 1998).

The activities of single and aggregates of neurons are being described and
differentiated by the D2 of their interevent interval attractors. Early and important
studies related to both neuronal and field electrical activity indicated their promise
(Rapp et al, 1985; Zimmerman and Rapp, 1991). The olefactory bulb demonstrated
spatially uniform scaling dimensions that changed with event-related perturbation
(Skinner et al, 1990). An iron-induced spiking focus in the rat hippocampus in vivo
manifested the same decrease in D2 as it did in the kindled in vitro hippocampal
slice (Koch et al, 1992). D2 also differentiated among characteristic single unit time
series in norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin neurons (Selz and Mandell,
1991) and among A8, A9 and A10 dopamine neurons (Selz and Mandell, 1992).
Attractors reconstructed from single unit interspike intervals in the substantia nigra
pars compacta and the auditory thalamus manifested discriminatable values for D2
in neurons recorded by the same electrode (Celletti and Villa, 1996) and changes in
state manifested in patterns of subthreshold oscillations in single neurons in the
inferioir olivary nucleus could be characterized using this index (Makarenko and
Llinas, 1998).

Dz reliably discriminated between states of arousal and between the
multiparameter (eye movements, neck muscle tone, EEG stage) defined EEG
stages of sleep (Bablyoyantz, 1986; Rapp et al, 1989; Ehlers et al, 1991) with non-
REM having a lower Dz than REM. Dz of the EEG record was selectively reduced in
Stage Il and REM in schizophrenic patients compared with controls (Roschke and
Aldenhoff, 1993), this difference was made more prominent by treatment with the

aminodiazopoxide, lorazepam (Roschke and Aldenhoff, 1992). In the waking state,
