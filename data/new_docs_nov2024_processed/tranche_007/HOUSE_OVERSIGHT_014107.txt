18. | Copies of any and all documents reflecting that Jane Doe #3 has ever willfully engaged in
prostitution.

RESPONSE:
Defendant objects to this Document Request as vague because Defendant is not in a position to
determine the willful nature of Jane Doe #3’s prostitution. Defendant further objects to this
Document Request because Jane Doe #3 has repeatedly and publicly asserted that she gave her
body for sexual activity for hire after the age of 18 and agreed to secure other persons for the
purpose of prostitution or for any other lewd or indecent act and therefore the Document Request
is unduly burdensome.
19. Copies of any and all documents reflecting that Jane Doe #3 is either a liar or has
perjured herself in any way.
RESPONSE:
Subject to and without waiving the General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce
all responsive, non-privileged documents currently in his possession, custody or control.
