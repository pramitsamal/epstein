I write in the hope of amicably resolving a number of issues that arise in connection
with the discovery responses you have provided in the referenced matter.

Responding Subject to and Without Waiving Objections

and Claims of Privilege

It is a common and improper tactic to state general objections (or even specific ones)
and then to respond to every request subject to those objections or claims of privilege.
We cannot accept such responses, When this occurs, even if responsive information is
forthcoming, we have no guarantee that you have not unilaterally withheld information
subject to the stated objections or claims of privilege; in other words, it shields the very
existence of responsive matters from discovery without any ability to assess the merits
of the objection or claim of privilege as applied to the ostensibly protected matters. A

federal court described the problem:

This Court has on several occasions disapproved [of] the practice of
asserting a general objection ‘to the extent’ it may apply to particular
requests for discovery. This Court has characterized these types of
objections as “worthless for anything beyond delay of the discovery. Such
objections are considered mere “hypothetical or contingent possibilities,
where the objecting party makes 'no meaningful effort to show the
application of any such theoretical objection’ to any request for discovery.
