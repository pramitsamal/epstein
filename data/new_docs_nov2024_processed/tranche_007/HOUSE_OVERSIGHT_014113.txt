Thus, this Court has deemed such “ostensible” objections waived or [has]
declined to consider them as objections.

Sonnino v. Univ. of Kan. Hosp. Auth., 221 F.R.D. 661, 666-67 (D. Kan. 2004) (citations
omitted).

Of course, where claims of privilege are involved, the response must include a privilege
log enabling us (and the court, if necessary) to assess the applicability of the privilege
claimed. See Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(b)(5S). Under Florida law, the burden is upon the
party asserting a privilege to establish the existence of each element of the privilege in
question. Fla. Sheriff's Self-Ins. Fund v. Escambia County, 585 So.2d 461, 463 (Fla. 1*
DCA 1991).

General or blanket objections are inappropriate in and of themselves: A 'blanket'
objection to interrogatories consisting of many, separate questions is insufficient.
Objections in such a case should be addressed ‘to a particular interrogatory or class of
interrogatories, not to the interrogatories in general. Twadell v. Twadell, 199 So. 2d
501 (Fla. 4 DCA 1967) (quoting Carson v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, 173 So.2d 743 (Fla.
2d DCA 1965)).

The same principles apply to the general objections you have raised to our production
requests.

Boilerplate Objections

A boilerplate objection such as overbroad, burdensome, and not reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, baldly asserted, is patently without
merit. Such stonewalling tactics constitute discovery abuse. First Healthcare Corp.
y. Hamilton, 740 So.2d 1189, 1193 (Fla. 4 DCA 1999); see also First City Devs. Of
Fla., Inc. v. Hallmark of Holly Condo. Ass 'n, 545 So.2d 502, 503 (Fla. 4 DCA 1985)
(noting that conclusory objections such as burdensome and not reasonably calculated
... are words of the art [that] have little meaning without substantive support, ..).

Every burdensome objection you have raised is required to be supported by an affidavit
detailing the extent of the burden claimed to preclude a substantive response.
