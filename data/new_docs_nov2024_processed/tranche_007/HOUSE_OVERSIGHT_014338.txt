organic and M&A driven growth opportunities during the next downturn. That said,
management noted that it was very likely that potential pro-growth measures taken
by the incoming Trump administration could push out any downturn, as in the short
run the economy would witness stronger growth.

Regions harnessing consumer to drive growth: Scott Peters, Senior EVP and
Consumer Services Group Head, Logan Pichel, Consumer Lending Group Head, and
Darren Smith, Treasurer, noted that Regions is utilizing its retail platform to drive
growth. Management highlighted strength in mortgage, card, and online lending as
avenues for growth. Importantly, management felt the US election has provided
tailwinds for Regions revenue growth prospects heading into 2017. Combined with
a better rate back drop, management sounded upbeat on its outlook.

= Multiple channels to drive loan growth: Management illustrated several avenues
for loan growth. Within mortgage, Regions has 450 originators that generate 95%
of its $6bn in annual originations. Management is seeking to increase its
originations from home loan direct and telephone banking to 15-20% of total
originations (currently 5% of originations) given the greater profitability from these
channels. Card growth has also been strong with active credit card growth at 12%
