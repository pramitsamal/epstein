Lessons from 2016

The old joke is that Year Aheads are frequently out of date by the end of year they are
written in. There is a real danger of that this year given the speed which things have
moved since Brexit and more recently the US election. The two charts below show that
Financials and Cyclicals have clawed back around 2/3 of their underperformance vs
Defensives. Of course it depends how you frame the question since we have included
Utilities and Telecoms in the defensive basket. But when we downgraded Banks 10 days
or so ago they had outperformed Food and Beverage by ~50% since the lows of early
July. Whichever way you cut it some of these moves have been extreme.

Moreover, in 2016 we doubt that even if investors had known the results of key events
that they would necessarily have got the reaction in markets right. As we joked in our
Cross Asset year ahead you needed not so much a crystal ball as a time machine to have
got things completely right this year. Aside from Brexit and Donald Trump winning the
US election it is easy to forget that in February we were worrying about a US recession
and deflation. US 5Y5Y forward breakeven inflation rates actually troughed at 1.8% at
that point. Four months later we were worrying about the deflationary impact of Brexit.
Now we are thinking about the reflation under a Trump Presidency.

The panic in markets in early February actually presented a perfect buying opportunity
for reflationary assets. Miners was a sector truly loathed by investors of all colours at
the start of the year with many thinking that some of the big players might even go
bust. If there is one key conclusion from all of this it is do not tie yourself to a view. We
