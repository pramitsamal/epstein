Barty argued in The Trump Inflection, Le Pen’s victory has the potential to be even more
of an earthquake for the world’s financial markets. Indeed, we have already seen a 1vol
move in April 2017 V2X futures since last month.

So our central case is French political risk caps markets to the upside for Q1 and most
of Q2 but that the centre right candidate Fillon is elected President. As Gilles Moec
argues, his pro-market reformist agenda could unlock French growth and we think it
could prove a significant positive catalyst for European equities more broadly if the
political risk premium is priced out against a solid European and global growth backdrop.

More of the same expected in Germany

We think Germany carries less political risk than the French election now that Merkel
has formally announced she will run again to be Chancellor. As a result, our central case
is that Merkel will continue to head a coalition government. We could see the populist
AfD win more votes than in 2012, but polls show a clear and decisive margin in favour
of the CDU and the existing coalition with the SDP suggests that an extension of their
partnership is the most likely eventuality.

Brexit was the big political topic for Europe going into 2016. Going forward we see it as
an ongoing issue but mostly for the UK (see UK — Waiting for Brexit for more details).

Rising bond yields & equities

With the market focus on the sharp bond market sell-off it is worth re-visiting the links
between equities and bonds as many investors question whether the effect on equities
will become negative the more yields rise. An environment of rising bond yields is not
inherently problematic. Over time correlations between bond yields and equities have
varied and on average have been very weak (if slightly positive) over the last twenty
years. Typically when rising yields reflect improving growth conditions and or rising risk
appetite equities have naturally benefitted. Certainly since 2010 for the most part
higher yields were accompanied by higher equity prices.

Track record mixed for stocks following bond yield spike. Does an exceptionally
sharp back up in bond yields represent a downside risk for equities? The historical
evidence is inconclusive. We looked at equity market returns in the months following
2.5SD moves in German bond yields (based on a comparison of rolling 3-month yield
changes to the 52-week average). The recent spike in German yields peaked at +2.9SD
on the same basis. We found 11 comparable episodes since 1980. Equity market returns
subsequent to the peak rate of change in bunds were moderately positive — a median
