time is different” is extremely dangerous for the

China, in fact, faces greater risk of a financial
crisis because of growing capital outflows. An
astounding $1.3 trillion of capital has flowed out
of China since August 2015, when it broadened the
trading range for its currency against the US dollar.
The outflows averaged $64 billion per month in

2016. At that pace, China’s total official foreign
currency holdings could drop below the IMF’s
reserve threshold of $2.8 trillion by mid-2017, as
shown in Exhibit 28.

Of course, China’s leadership has not stood on
the sidelines. Since September 2015, the People’s
Bank of China and the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange have introduced a series of
measures to limit capital outflows. These measures
have included orders to financial institutions
to carefully check and strengthen controls on
all foreign exchange transactions”! and strict
oversight of Chinese companies’ outward
investment in overseas property, hotels, cinemas
and the entertainment and sports industries.”
According to reports, leadership has also ordered
increased oversight of trade activities to make
sure companies are not over-invoicing the value
of their imports or under-invoicing the value of
their exports as a means of circumventing capital
controls.”? Exports and imports are 20% and
15%, respectively, of China’s GDP. It is virtually
impossible for China to halt capital flows in such
a porous economy without slowing GDP growth
rates. Thus, China will not be able to completely
stem outflows despite all its measures to slow the
pace as much as possible.

Irrespective of the success of such capital
controls, China’s growing debt problem poses
significant risks to China’s growth
trajectory. We estimate that the risk
of a hard landing is only about 25%
in 2017 but will increase rapidly to
about 50% in 2018 and be closer to
75% in 2019. Therefore, while China
is not a near-term risk, there is a high
probability of an intermediate-term crisis
that will reverberate through financial
markets. We also know that we cannot
anticipate the exact timing of such crises,
especially given the uncertainty of how
US-China relations will unfold under a
Trump administration.

US-China Relations Deteriorate Under
the Trump Administration

There is no doubt that US strategy
toward China will shift; the only
question is when and how. There are
two channels by which the Trump
administration could affect US-China
relations: trade and foreign policy.
