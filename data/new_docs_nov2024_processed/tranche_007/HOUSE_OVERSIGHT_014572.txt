three culprits: economic imbalances, excessive
Federal Reserve tightening and/or exogenous
shocks (most commonly in the form of spiraling
oil prices).

As we survey these risks today, none are
particularly alarming. The depth of the financial
crisis and the lackluster pace of the recovery have
allowed the US to avoid the imbalances that would
typically be evident this far into an expansion (see
Section I of this year’s Outlook). If anything, there
is scope for spending in cyclical parts of the US
economy relative to overall GDP to move toward
its long-term average (see Exhibit 31).

There is also less risk of disruptive Federal
Reserve tightening, given how few signs we see
of economic overheating. Headline inflation
remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2.0% target,
and though we expect it to move higher this year,
normalizing energy prices are a key driver (see
Exhibit 32). Further, while the November 2016
unemployment rate of 4.6% suggests the economy
is near full employment, broader measures of labor
slack, as well as today’s depressed labor force
participation rate, argue that the central bank is
not “behind the curve” (see Exhibit 33). Lastly,
our expectation for continued modest gains for the
US dollar and a rebound in productivity growth
from generational lows (see Exhibit 34) provides a
natural offset to inflation pressures, even as wages
continue to rise.

There are still signs of slack in the labor market.

* Long-term rate.

Of equal importance, the Federal Reserve is
acutely aware of the risks that tighter monetary
policy poses to the business cycle, which is
apparent in both its willingness to step back
from planned rate hikes last year as well as
Chair Yellen’s acknowledgment that an “abrupt
tightening would risk disrupting financial markets
and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy
into recession.”!*! With neutral real interest rates
