near zero and inflation expectations still below
levels compatible with its inflation target, the
Federal Reserve is likely to hike rates two or three
times in 2017, below the historical average pace.
On this point, it is worth remembering that the
Federal Reserve originally projected four hikes by
the end of 2016, yet enacted only one in December.
Thus, even if the Federal Reserve does raise rates
three times this year, it will have delivered those
four hikes over two years instead of just one.
Lastly, although a recession created by an
external shock is always a risk, the probability we
place on a hard landing in Europe and/or China
or a destabilizing increase in oil prices is not
currently high enough to alter our base-case view.
Indeed, even with the recent cut in oil production
coordinated between OPEC and non-OPEC
members, the size of today’s oil-supply glut and the
historical tendency for producers to exceed their
quotas greatly reduce the risk of a price spike (see

With none of the typical signs of

economic contractions flashing red,

we accord a 15% probability of a
recession in 2017.

Section III, Global Commodities). With none of
the typical signs of economic contractions flashing
red, we accord a 15% probability of a recession in
2017, roughly in line with historical average risk.

Against this backdrop, we expect US real GDP
growth to accelerate from last year’s moderate
1.6% pace, reaching 1.9-2.7% in 2017. There are
three key drivers to this story: fading headwinds,
a resilient US consumer and supportive policy. We
discuss each below.

Fading Headwinds

The combination of falling oil prices and a

rising dollar that began in mid-2014 has been a
meaningful drag on US growth, with energy-related
capital spending falling by more than 60% over
this period. In addition, exports have softened,

the S&P 500 has suffered almost two years of
contracting profits, and inventories throughout the
supply chain have ballooned as activity has slowed.
Such broad-based weakness has rarely
occurred outside a recession.

The silver lining to last year’s
slowdown, however, is that growth is
now poised to improve from depressed
levels. A modest recovery in oil prices
and stabilization of the dollar enabled
US economic activity to accelerate
notably in the second half of last year

(see Exhibit 35). This boost will be aided
