the same time, the recovery in commodity prices,
recent firming in global growth and potential for
expansionary fiscal policy are shifting the focus
from deflation to reflation.

This shift in perspective arrives at a time when
the market’s vulnerability to rising rates is the
highest on record (see Exhibit 77). Losses from
these long-duration positions in response to higher
rates could beget more bond sales, creating a
vicious cycle. That yields are still extremely low
by historical standards does little to assuage these
fears. Consider that 10-year government bond
yields in all G-7 countries have been higher at least
90% of the time since 1958. Given all the above,

For now, we remain tactically
positioned to benefit from further

renminbi weakness given our long-

standing concerns about China’s
economic vulnerabilities and the
likelihood of looser policy, policy
mistakes and capital outflows.

we believe the ascent of interest rates remains in
its infancy.

Still, it is important to differentiate between
a normalization of interest rates and a disorderly
backup. While we expect higher interest rates over
the coming years, secular headwinds—like aging
demographics and slower productivity growth—
suggest the terminal point of that increase will be
lower than the historical average. This fact is not
lost on the Federal Reserve, which has reduced
its estimate of the long-run equilibrium nominal
rate—the rate consistent with full employment and
stable inflation in the medium term—from 4.25%
to 3% over recent years.

With a lower interest rate target
to reach, the Federal Reserve is likely
to proceed slowly, particularly given
uncertainty around its estimate of the
economy’s equilibrium rate and lingering
international risks. Even if the Federal
Reserve were to raise rates three times in
2017, that pace would still be less than
half of the historical median tightening
pace.** Thus far in this cycle, the
Federal Reserve has raised rates only
once per year.

Against this backdrop, we recommend
investors favor credit over duration risk
