At this juncture, the Indian rupee seems to be the only one in the region that is expected
to display a much lower sensitivity to US rates, outperforming others within Asia. We
expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore to keep the SGD NEER in the weaker side
of the band for the next few months, which reduces the downside risk for the trade
(Chart 69). We like the INR as the preferred long, followed by the IDR, as they offer high
risk-adjusted carry, central banks are interested in keeping their currencies stable,
current account deficits are bounded, and the currencies are not expensive relative to
long term fundamentals. The main risk of the trade is of higher oil prices, and
considerable reversal of capital flows. Apart from that, a change in the behavior of
Reserve Bank of India it terms of managing INR to accumulate international reserves is
also a risk.

LatAm: long PEN/CLP

We like long PEN/CLP (spot 195.7, target 200, stop 195.5). LatAm is the most
exposed region within EM to global factors. Traditional carry trade candidates like the
Brazilian real and the Argentina peso are no longer attractive given the still fragile fiscal
stance in both countries. Local positioning in BRL has proven to be heavier than
thought, and we expect the currency to continue weakening until we observe some
stabilization in US rates. The Brazilian real is still overvalued and the economy will be
negatively affected since its strategy to gradually reduce budget deficits is based on low
global rates, capital inflows and higher domestic growth. In the case of the Argentine
peso, despite showing some detachment from global factors and some positive inflows
due to the tax amnesty, we think the currency needs to weaken given the recent
depreciation of the BRL and its current overvaluation as well as the government fiscal
needs for 2017, which is an important electoral year. Therefore, we remain neutral on
these currencies.

A more modest but more interesting carry trade within LatAm in an environment of
higher US rates is to be long the Peruvian sol, funded with the Chilean peso, in order to
make the trade more neutral to commodity exposure. The Peruvian economy is expected
to continue growing at rates above 4% due to strong mining activity; the new
government will likely implement expansionary fiscal policy and has room to finance it.
The exchange rate is close to its equilibrium value based on terms-of-trade and
productivity. In fact, we expect the currency to appreciate in real terms if growth
recovers as predicted. The currency still offers a decent carry. We forecast a nominal
depreciation but below the forward. The central bank has a strong preference for low
currency volatility and would be ready to intervene in case of a disorderly depreciation,
as it has been already the case in the last few days with small interventions in the
forward market.

On the other hand, Chile’s growth remains anemic and the economy is expected to
continue growing sub 2% in 2017 (Chart 71). The CLP is overvalued but recent flows
