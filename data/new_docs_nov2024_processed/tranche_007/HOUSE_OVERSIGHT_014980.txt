Volatility in Europe
Buy EU banks dispersion: (+) basket call, (-) worst-of calls

Trade: Long Dec17 105% call on an equally weighted basket of SAN, BNP, ING,
ISP & DBK*, short Dec17 ATM worst-of call on the same basket for 1.8% indic.
(correl bid: 81%).

* We pick the top 5 stocks with the largest market cap within the SX7E (EU banks sector

index) corresponding to 5 different countries

We have previously highlighted our preference for vol dispersion trades both in the US
and the EU — with the most recent recommendation being sector dispersion
opportunities within the EU. In a similar vein, we suggest positioning for greater
dispersion within EU banks via buying a call on a basket of Santander, BNP Paribas, ING,
Intesa and Deutsche Bank part-financed by selling a worst-of call on the same basket as:

¢ Improving macro/earnings, sensitivity to rates and regulatory headwinds likely
to lead to greater differentiation within banks: An improving macro backdrop in
Europe & ongoing improvement in EPS revisions (see Style Cycle) paint a bullish
picture for EU banks as they are seen as leveraged macro plays within the EU.
However, we believe there is a potential for greater differentiation within banks as
our bank analysts have argued before (here and here} that: (i) some banks stand to
benefit more than others based on their earnings power should the uptick in the
earnings cycle continue, (ii) banks’ gearing to interest rate cycles, and therefore
likely impact from a more hawkish ECB, varies between different banks and (iii)
French and Benelux banks are likely to be most impacted under potential Basel IV
regulations.

+ Entry point is attractive given historically low implied vols: The structure
benefits from its long vol bias as average 6M implied vol on the basket of 5
European banks is historically low (13% %-ile since Jan-08, Chart 16).

¢ High implied correlation beneficial for structure’s short correlation bias: Chart
17 shows the average pairwise 6M and 3M realised correlations between the 5 EU
banks, which are historically low. Despite this recent drop in realised correlations,
implied correlation is priced higher, thus providing an interesting entry point for the
(short-correlation) trade.
