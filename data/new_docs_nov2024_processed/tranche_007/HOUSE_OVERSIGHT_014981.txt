- Attractive risk-reward profile at current pricing: As highlighted in Exhibit 1,
historically the trade held to expiry, at current pricing, would have generated an
average P&L of 8.4% when positive and -1.8% when negative. The risk-reward
looks even more attractive in extreme market outcomes as the max P&L of the
trade which is greater than 75% compares to the max loss of only 5.7%. The trade
also provides an effective way to gain long exposure to EU equities with limited
risks, as evident from the call-like payoff in Exhibit 1 (vs the ESTX50). It is worth
noting that, by construction, the maximum loss of the trade is 6.8% with the most
likely loss limited to the upfront premium of 1.8%. We also note that the trade
payoff profile is superior to a SX5E Dec17 ATM call when sized such that: (i) the call
premium is the same as the upfront premium for the dispersion trade (=1.8%, blue

line), as well as (ii) when the call premium is the same as the theoretical maximum
loss for the trade (=6.8%, orange line).

be indicative of future performance. The two call payoff diagrams shown in the chart correspond to SX5E Dec17 3575 strike call sized such that upfront premium = 1.8% (0.46x notional, blue line, equal to the upfront
premium for the trade) and 6.8% (1.7x notional, orange line, equal to potential max loss of the trade)
