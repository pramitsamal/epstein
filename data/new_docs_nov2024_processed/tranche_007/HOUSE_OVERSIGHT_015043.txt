buzz-would serve as my lifetime filter for perceiving reality and its rules. If

| finished playing “Vivaldi” by rote. Then | bowed to the audience
and walked off stage. The applause continued, and | was pushed back on
stage by my violin teacher, to play an encore, “Orientale.” | had
previously asked him-while rehearsing the encore—why it wasn't listed on
the program since we already knew that | would play it at the concert. But
instead of answering my question, he poked me in the chest, verbalizing
each poke: “Violin up/ Violin up’ Now, while playing “Orientale,” |
heard the echo of his voice, and | automatically raised my violin higher.

Then | popped my ears and the music sounded clearer. | wondered if
it sounded clearer to the audience too. They had no idea that their
laughter had woken me up. | was overwhelmed by the notion that
everybody in the audience had their own individual 7his-/s-me, but maybe
some of them were still asleep and didn't know it. How could you tell who
was awake and who was asleep? After all, | hadn't known that /was asleep,
and look what | accomplished before | woke up. If it hadn't been for that

itch, | might st///be asleep.
