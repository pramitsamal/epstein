For example, | occasionally went too far while wearing my anti-
Communist mask. When former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach
exposed the DuBois Clubs as a Communist front organization, poison-pen
letters and threatening telephone calls were received by many of the Boys
Clubs from patriotic Americans who were understandably confused by the
ostensibly coincidental pronunciations. But in my function as National
Board Chairman of the Boys Clubs of America, | charged that the name
choice was “an almost classic example of Communist deception and
duplicity” and that the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs “are not unaware of the
confusion they are causing among our supporters and among many other
good citizens.”

In retrospect, however, | admit that this was a slightly foolish

position to espouse.

In August of 1945, while | was still serving in the Navy, stationed in
Maryland, there was a Committee of 100 seeking—according to an
advertisement they placed in several California newspapers—a candidate
for Congress “with no previous political experience, to defeat a man who
has represented the district in the House for ten years.” This was a

reference to Jerry Voorhis.
