always--move from a human form to a reptilian-type form. There is the
Mayan legend of the iguana. Lizard-like aliens had descended upon the
Mayans. Their pyramids—their advanced astronomical technology
including the sacrifice of virgins—were supposedly inspired by lizard aliens.
When the aliens interbred with the Mayans, they produced a form of life
they could inhabit. They fluctuated between a human and iguana
appearance in chameleon-like abilities, a perfect vehicle for transforming
into world leaders.

“Those who have seen a reptilian-type ethereal figure enveloping
and following around humans and locking into them in those lower two
chakra points, vortex points, for me, is possession. The more |’ ve
understood this, the more |’ ve realized just how many people, particularly
these bloodlines, are actually controlled by these other-dimensional forces,
and while we appear to be seeing a president or a banking leader in a
physical form, the actual point of control is beyond that and
overshadowing it, and on some occasion people see that overshadowing
entity.”

One wonders whether such a defense— “The reptile made me do

it!” —will some day be used in a court of law.
