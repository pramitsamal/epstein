Mgestic, an interactive computer game revolving around a conspiracy
involving corporate intrigue, was available. For $10 a month, tens of
thousands of online players would receive screaming phone calls at
midnight, faxes, anonymous emails and instant messages from mysterious
informers directing them to research strange alien conspiracies and
nefarious government activities. Majestic was suspended on September 12,
2001.

The invasion of the United States on September 11th was the
mother of all conspiracies. Immediately there were those who began

security procedures. In any case, political opportunism has been providing

That Halloween, | was invited by producer Andy Meisler to be a
panelist at the taping of a new TV series, 7he Conspiracy Zone. Although
the plot behind the 9/11 terrorists was certainly a topic of conversation in

subject that evening was the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968.
