like a miracle, which is merely because of our very narrow concept of how
the universe works.”

Ram Dass knew of my involvement with conspiracy theory. “I'm just
involved in a much greater conspiracy,” he continued. “You can't grasp
the size of the conspiracy | understand--but there's no conspirator--it's the
wrong word. That's why | say it's just natural law. It is all perfect.”

“Would you agree with the concept--what William Blake said, that
humans were created ‘for joy and woe'--the implication of which is that
there will always be suffering?”

“| think that suffering is part of man's condition, and that's what
the incarnation is about, and that's what the human plane is.”

So | asked Ram Dass, “If you and | were to exchange philosophies--
if | believed in reincarnation and you didn't--how do you think our
behavior would change?” He paused fora moment. “Well,” he said, “if
you believed in reincarnation, you would never ask a question like that.”

And then his low chuckle of amusement and surprise blossomed
into an uproarious belly laugh of delight and triumph as he savored the
implications of his own Zen answer. | would find myself playing that
segment of the tape with his bell-shaped spasm of laughter over and over

again, like a favorite piece of music.
