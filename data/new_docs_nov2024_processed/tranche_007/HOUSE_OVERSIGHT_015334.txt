the electorate. It does not reside with either of the two major political
parties. It is not represented by the press. It is not arbitrated by a judiciary
that protects us from predators. Power rests with corporations. And
corporations gain very lucrative profits from war, even wars we have no
chance of winning. All polite appeals to the formal systems of power will
not end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must physically obstruct the
war machine or accept a role as its accomplice.”

When it comes to bloodbaths, the only difference between such
invisible corporations and Jared Loughner is that he did it face-to-face.

Obviously, Loughner is crazy, but not legally insane, because he
knew right from wrong, as indicated by his expectation of life in prison or
execution for his unspeakable crime. True, John Hinckley was crazy when
he tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan—his motivation was to impress
actress Jodie Foster so she would go out bowling with him--yet he was
sentenced to serve //s time in a mental hospital, including occasional
outings with his parents, which resulted in public outrage and a weakening
of the insanity defense.

Ironically, Hinckley came out for gun control, and Reagan came out

against it.
