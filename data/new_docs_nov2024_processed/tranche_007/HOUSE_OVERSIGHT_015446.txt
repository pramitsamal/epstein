“We better run,” | told Marilee.
“Why? They’ re not gonna hit us.”
“Yes, they are! Run! Hurry!”

The police had been let out of their cage and they were absolutely
enraged. Marilee got away, but | was struck with a nightstick on the
outside of my right knee. | fell to the ground. The cop ran off to injure as
many other cockroaches in his kitchen as he could. Another cop came
charging and he yelled at me, “Get up/ Get up!”

‘l’ m trying to!”

He made a threatening gesture with his billy club, and when | tried
to protect my head with my arms, he jabbed me viciously on the exposed
right side of my ribs. Oh, God, the pain! The cops were running amuck
now, in an orgy of indiscriminate sadism, swinging their clubs wildly and
screaming, “Get the fuck outa here you fuckin’ faggots, you
motherfuckin’ cocksuckers!”

| managed to drag myself along the sidewalk. It felt like an electric
cattle prod was stuck between my ribs. Marilee drove me to a hospital
emergency ward. X-rays indicated that | had a fractured rib and a

punctured lung.
