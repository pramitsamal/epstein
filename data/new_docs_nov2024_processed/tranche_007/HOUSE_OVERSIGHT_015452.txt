to maintain the status quo. He had unintentionally revealed the true
nature of the threat he perceived. What he rea//y said to me was, “So you
like the evolution of human consciousness, huh?”

“Well, yeah,” | thought, “now that you mention it, | do. | mean,
when you put it like that--So you /like the evolution of human
consciousness, huh?--sure, | do. | like it a whole lot.” Too bad | had
remained silent instead of using my instinct and advising Julius, “Let’ s

get the hell out of here.”

5. Once, in the men’ s room at an airport, | couldn’ t help but
notice a man standing at a urinal a urinals away from the one where | was
carefully aiming my stream with my left hand onto the round marzipan-
like disinfectant. But he was allowing his penis to aim itself, because he
happened to be busy using both hands to floss his teeth. It was a

monument to multi-tasking.

I' m embarrassed to admit that, rather then flossing, | would use a
dollar bill to clean between my_ teeth. Instead, | was
actually adding bacteria to my mouth, thereby giving a_ new, literal
meaning to the concept of “dirty money.” As a result, my teeth were in

terrible shape.
