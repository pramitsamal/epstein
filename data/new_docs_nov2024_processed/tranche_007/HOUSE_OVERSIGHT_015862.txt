172 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

at some point in the future. The only way to know is to build a perfect
model of the system and see what happens. Poincaré won a valuable
prize for his proof from the King of Bavaria. You can see some amazingly
complex orbits plotted below. Remember these are still deterministic and
predictable — after all, they were calculated with a computer — they are
just chaotic.

Butterflies and Sliding Doors

After Poincaré, the field of chaos remained fairly quiet until Edward
Lorenz began studying weather patterns using computers in the 1960s.
The story goes, one day his computer was misbehaving and he had to re-
key some data into the machine. Rather than using eight decimal places
he used only six to save time, and was amazed when the results of his
program came out completely different. Dropping the seventh and eighth
decimal place represents a change of only one part in a million, yet the
patterns of weather predicted by the computer were completely altered.
