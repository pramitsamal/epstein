226 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

The Proof

Let’s write a list of all the possible programs my laptop could ever run. A
comprehensive way to do this is to start at one and try every number.As
I count up Iam simply generating numbers, for example, 5,433,232, then
turning each number into a program file and running it. For a bit of fun,
I created a couple and tried them out on my laptop. They did nothing, so
it was not very edifying. Most numbers are just junk because programs
have to be in the right format for the computer you are working on. It’s
just like words. If you randomly take a handful of scrabble tiles out of a
bag, most of the time you will have nonsense, but every now and they
you will have an actual word. Be careful with this; you could accidentally
write, “delete every item on my hard disk.” Of course, the probability is
astronomically low, but Murphy’s Law says it will happen, so back up
your data!

As you count up, you will generate every possible program along the
way. A mathematician would say programs are recursively enumerable.
The word recursive means there is an algorithm and enumerable means
to count. Therefore, there is a counting algorithm that would run every
imaginable program. Here is a list of them, or at least a some of the

highlights:

0 (probably doesn’t run)

1 (ditto)

00 (ditto)

01 (ditto)

011001001001000100 (makes the computer beep once)

... (from here on T'll give the program names since the numbers are
too large to print)

Does Nothing (there are many of these)

Is Gibberish (there are an infinite number of these)

Junk (an infinite number of these)

Print Something (again an infinite number of these)

More Gibberish

Excel

Word

PowerPoint

Mathematica...
