Hospital quality would be key to attracting private buyers

The government has not invested in hospital infrastructure and some hospitals may
require substantial investment by any buyer, if they are acquired at all. One Saudi
hospital operator has said that there is no way it would seek to acquire government
hospitals for that reason.

Bidders would likely want to obtain scale benefits from multiple purchases
Operating hospitals has benefits of scale in terms of centralising certain non-medical
services (e.g. purchasing, catering, laundering) and allocating central costs over a greater
revenue base. The greatest financial benefit would come from acquiring groups of
hospitals to maximise these benefits. There would likely be cases where staff, and/or
high net worth individuals chose to bid for individual assets.

Privatisation proceeds could defray some of NTP cost

Amounts raised from any privatisation would reflect the degree of competition for
individual assets as well as level of reimbursement and the profits any acquirer could
generate. In terms of pure asset values we assume the Riyadh and Jeddah hospitals (60)
would be worth more than those elsewhere (210), simply because of the greater
population currently and higher expected future growth. Government hospitals are likely
lower cost than that of private facilities given they are not competing on the quality of
accommodation offered. Arbitrarily assuming US$100m for hospitals in Jeddah and
Riyadh and USS50m elsewhere would imply proceeds of $16.5bn (SAR61bn). If every
hospital were sold then it could more than cover the SAR23bn allocated to the MoH for
the NTP. That seems unlikely however; there will be hospitals that require substantial
investment and aren’t worth the indicative figures we have used above, or are in areas
where profitability means there will be no return for the private sector at that level of
acquisition.

Reforms could attract additional competition

Incumbent private hospital operators are best placed to expand and are seen as the
natural buyers of any privatised assets. However, any substantial privatisation process,
or the potential created by widespread adoption of private health insurance in general,
could attract interest from foreign investors or operators. We note only a small number
of international hospital groups to date have experience of successfully operating in
multiple countries (IHH, Mediclinic), and we think Saudi Arabia could be too challenging
as a first step for those yet to operate outside their domestic market.

Structure of insurance market needs to be set
There are a number of ways the government could roll-out private health insurance
more widely:
