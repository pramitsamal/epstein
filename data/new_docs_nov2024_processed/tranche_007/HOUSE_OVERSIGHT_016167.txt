The government could set up a state insurance company

The government could set up a single-state insurer that is either funded through direct
contributions or through general taxation. The government would likely need to get
external help from a party knowledgeable in insurance and risk, which could be an
insurer, Saudi or otherwise. Daman, Abu Dhabi's health insurer is owned 80% by its
government and 20% by German insurance company Munich Re.

Existing private insurers may not have capacity if they were made responsible
The government could decide to execute any financing scheme through existing private
insurers, or give citizens the option of choosing either a government or private insurer.
The existing private healthcare insurers in Saudi Arabia are unlikely to have the
resources (both people and systems) in place to provide cover for an additional 20m
people immediately and will need some time to prepare. Any large scale immediate
expansion could put them at risk of substantial underwriting losses that they would
presumably seek to have back-stopped by the government in the initial stages.
