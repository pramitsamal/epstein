Alison Gopnik is an international leader in the field of children’s learning and
development and was one of the founders of the field of “theory of mind.” She has
spoken of the child brain as a “powerful learning computer,” perhaps from personal
experience. Her own Philadelphia childhood was an exercise in intellectual
development. “Other families took their kids to see The Sound of Music or Carousel; we
saw Racine ’s Phaedra and Samuel Beckett’s Endgame,” she has recalled. “Our family
read Henry Fielding’s 18th-century novel Joseph Andrews out loud to each other around
the fire on camping trips.”

Lately she has invoked Bayesian models of machine learning to explain the
remarkable ability of preschoolers to draw conclusions about the world around them
without benefit of enormous data sets. “I think babies and children are actually more
conscious than we are as adults,” she has said. “They’re very good at taking in lots of
information from lots of different sources at once.” She has referred to babies and young
children as “the research and development division of the human species.” Not that she
treats them coldly, as if they were mere laboratory animals. They appear to revel in her
company, and in the blinking, thrumming toys in her Berkeley lab. For years after her
own children had outgrown it, she kept a playpen in her office.

Her investigations into just how we learn, and the parallels to the deep-learning
methods of AI, continues. “Tt turns out to be much easier to simulate the reasoning of a
highly trained adult expert than to mimic the ordinary learning of every baby,” she says.
“Computation is still the best—indeed, the only—scientific explanation we have of how a
Physical object like a brain can act intelligently. But, at least for now, we have almost no
idea at all how the sort of creativity we see in children is possible.”
