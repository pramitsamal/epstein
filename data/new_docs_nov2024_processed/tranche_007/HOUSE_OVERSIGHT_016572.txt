a day but he would review it. Mr. Walton reviewed the transcript and noted that it
showed $125.00 a day but the Board order specified $250.00 a day and he would
have to do further research.

Mr. Fried advised he could make a motion to postpone the matter to the next
meeting and have Mr. Walton bring back the correct information. There was
additional discussion about the amount of the fine and Mr. Lynch said he was
seeking a reduction of the $17,125.00 which would be the amount of the fine if it
was $125.00 a day. Mr. Hoffman said he would find that hard to accept. Mr.
Hoffman read from the minutes that a motion was made by Mr. Fried that the
defendant was found in non-compliance, ordered to pay an administrative fee in
the amount of $150.00, obtain a final building inspection by October 25, 2008 and
a fine of $125.00 to commence on October 26, 2007. He said that motion passed
4-3. Mr. Walton said he could not dispute that but he would have to do some
research. Mr. Hoffman said he would not be in favor of reducing the $17, 125.00
any further.

Mr. Ochstein said he was hesitant to do anything until they know what the number
is. Mr. Walton suggesting postponing the case until next month.
