MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

C. Case # 08-2479, 2299 E. Ibis Isle Road, 2299 E. Ibis Isle Road LLC
Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, unsightly, unsafe or unsanitary conditions not allowed and properties
to be maintained in good condition.

Code Enforcement Officer Gerry also presented the facts of this case and said the
violation had been discovered in his normal routine patrol of the area. The
property owner was cited and given until April 10, 2008 to come into compliance.
He said the property owner had been cited previously on March 23, 2006, October
30, 2007 and November 14, 2007 but had not been brought before the Code
Enforcement Board because the owner would come into compliance prior to the
date given. He said the Town’s recommendation is a finding of non-compliance,
administrative costs of $150.00 and the violator given until April 19, 2008 to come
into compliance.

MOTION BY MR. FRIED TO FIND THE VIOLATOR IN NON-
COMPLIANCE, ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF $150.00 AND
GIVE THEM UNTIL APRIL 19, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE.

D. Case # 08-2480, 1089 S. Ocean Blvd., Leonard Schneider
Violation of Chapter 122, Section 122-53 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances: the Town Council authorizes the Director of Public Works to order
curtailment of the use of water for certain nonessential purposes including
specifying certain days and hours when lawns and shrubbery may be watered.

Code Enforcement Officer Weymer said this case concerned a water violation. A
written warning had been issued for a violation which occurred on March 15,
2008. A second violation then occurred on March 29, 2008 at 11:33 a.m. and the
notice was issued by certified mail. The fine had been paid this morning so the
Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, acceptance of the payment of the
fine and no further action be taken.

MOTION BY MS. GREENBERG TO FIND THE VIOLATOR IN NON-
COMPLIANCE, ACCEPTANCE OF THE PAYMENT OF THE FINE AND
NO FURTHER ACTION TAKEN.
