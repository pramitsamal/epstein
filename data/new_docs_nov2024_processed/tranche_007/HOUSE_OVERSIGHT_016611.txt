Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 04/17/08

Mr. Fried complimented the Staff on the packets of photographs being put
together for the Board, that it makes their analysis and discussion more effective
and more efficient.

VIII. Fine Consideration:

A. Case # 08-2432, Beachfront Vista Property, Nightingale Beach Club Association
Violation of Chapter 134, Section 134-1472 (3) of the Town of Palm Beach Code
of Ordinances, no additional walls, fences, hedges or other structures or growth
shall be erected or be grown eastwardly of Ocean Boulevard to a height greater
than four (4) feet above the surface of the Ocean Boulevard.

Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said this case had been postponed from a
previous meeting as a permit had been applied for per the Board’s order. He said
he had received an e-mail yesterday from John Wettstein, who is with the State of
Florida. Mr. Wettstein’s e-mail said a permit must be issued or denied by the State
by June 13, 2008. The case is still under review so Mr. Walton requested a
postponement until June 19, 2008. Mr. Hoffman requested that date be June 18,
as the Code Enforcement Board hearing is June 19, 2008. Mr. Randolph said it is
possible the permit could be issued by the May meeting. Mr. Walton revised his
request to postpone to the May 15, 2008 meeting and said if there had been no
decision at that time, he would ask for another postponement.
