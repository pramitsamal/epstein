Fig. $17. Suppression of authors on the Art and Literary History blacklists in German. We plot the
median trajectory (as in the main text) of authors in the Herman lists for Art (green) and Literary History
(red), and for authors found in the 1938 blacklist (blue). The Nazi regime (1933-1945) is highlighted, and
corresponds to strong drops in the trajectories of these authors.
