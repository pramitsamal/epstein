Fig. $18. Tracking historical epidemics using their influence on the surrounding culture. (A) Usage
frequency of various diseases: ‘fever’ (blue), ‘cancer’ (green), ‘asthma’ (red), ‘tuberculosis’ (cyan),
‘diabetes’ (purple), ‘obesity’ (yellow) and ‘heart attack’ (black). (B) Cultural prevalence of AIDS and HIV.
We highlight the year 1983 when the viral agent was discovered. (C) Usage of the term ‘cholera’ peaks
during the cholera epidemics that affected Europe and the US (blue shading). (D) Usage of the term
‘infantile paralysis’ (blue) exhibits one peak during the 1916 polio epidemic (blue shading), and a second
around the time of a series of polio epidemics that took place during the early 1950s. But the second
peak is anomalously broad. Discussion of polio during that time may have been fueled by the election of
‘Franklin Delano Roosevelt’ (green), who had been paralyzed by polio in 1936 (green shading), as well as

by the development of the ‘polio vaccine’ (red) in 1952. The vaccine ultimately eradicated ‘infantile

paralysis’ in the United States.
