2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *881

The differences between the two approaches might seem modest until one recognizes that another provision in the Advisory
Committee's proposals appears to intentionally omit any reference to a victim representative. Proposed Rule 60, the Advisory
Committee's global provision dealing with victims' rights, explains who may enforce victims’ rights. !?? In clear contrast to
the CVRA's governing provision, this proposed rule omits any reference to a crime victim's representative. Proposed Rule 60
provides only that the rights of a victim under these rules may be asserted by the victim and the attorney for the government.
'23 Tn contrast, the CVRA enforcement provision states: The crime victim or the crime victim's lawful representative, and the
attorney for the Government may assert the rights described in subsection (a). !°4 Nothing in the Advisory Committee Notes
indicates that a crime victim's representative is among those authorized to assert the rights. The Advisory Committee also
struck existing [*882] language in the Rules about a victim's representative exercising the victim's right to speak at
sentencing. !?>

The repeated omission of any reference to a victim's representative is unsettling given the Advisory Committee's promise to
simply track the CVRA's language. !° Its failure to track the language here leaves the impression that the Advisory Committee
is uncomfortable with a victim's representative asserting rights. Perhaps the Committee could make a policy argument against
such representation, but Congress has said victims have the right to have representatives speak for them. The Federal Rules
should follow the CVRA and state clearly that a victim's representative can assert a victim's rights.

The need for clarity on this point is heightened by pre-CVRA caselaw questioning any right by a victim's representative to
assert victims' rights. Most notably, in one of the Oklahoma City bombing prosecutions, the Tenth Circuit rebuked a trial judge
for permitting an attorney for the bombing victims to participate in oral argument at a sentencing hearing. !*7 The Circuit
stated that in the absence of any authority permitting the participation of victims’ counsel, we harbor concerns about the
propriety of the district court's rulings. !78 This statement can no longer be regarded as good law in light of the CVRA's
commands. !°°

Another reason for clarity is to make sure that corporate and organizational victims are able to be heard in the process. The
CVRA's definition of victim - a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense
130 _ is essentially lifted from federal restitution statutes. '3! Federal courts have consistently held that a person entitled to

restitution includes corporate entities. !32 Of course, such legal entities cannot appear personally but only through [*883] a
