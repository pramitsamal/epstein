The movement also successfully prodded the federal system to recognize victims’ rights. In 1982 Congress passed the first
federal victims’ rights legislation, the Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA). 7’ The VWPA had three primary goals: (1)
to expand and protect the role of victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process; (2) to ensure that the federal government
used all available resources to protect and assist victims without infringing defendants’ constitutional rights; and (3) to provide
a model for state and local legislation. 78 Since passage of the VWPA, Congress has remained active in this area of the law,
passing several acts further protecting victims’ rights, such as the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, 7? the Victims' Rights and
Restitution Act of 1990, 3° the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 3! the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996, ** and the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. *3 Other federal statutes have been passed to
deal with specialized victim situations such as child victims and witnesses. *4

[*844] These statutes spawned guidelines for how federal prosecutors should treat crime victims. The VWPA required the
Attorney General to develop guidelines for the Department of Justice. *° To implement this Act, the Attorney General
developed guidelines designed to assist victims during the criminal justice process, mandating protocol, separate waiting areas
at court, the prompt return of the victim's property, and victim training for law enforcement personnel. 3° The guidelines also
directed that prosecutors notify victims about available services, major case events, consultations with the prosecutor, and the
opportunity for consultation about the prosecution. 37 In 2000, Attorney General Reno updated and expanded the guidelines.
The revised guidelines heightened the notification requirements, requiring prosecutors and law enforcement agents to notify
victims of important criminal justice events and to confer with victims about important decisions in the process. 3%

Among the federal victims' statutes, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 is noteworthy. This Act purported to create
a comprehensive list of victims' rights in the federal criminal justice process. It commanded that [a] crime victim has the
following rights and then listed various procedural rights, including the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for
the victim's dignity and privacy, °° to be notified of court proceedings, *° to confer with [the] attorney for the Government
