2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *851

(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any
parole proceeding;

(5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case;

(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law;

(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay;

(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. 8?

Rather than relying merely on the best efforts of prosecutors to vindicate rights, the CVRA also contains specific
enforcement [*852] mechanisms. ?° Most importantly, it directly gives victims standing to assert their rights, addressing a
flaw in the earlier enactment. ?! The Act provides that rights can be asserted by the crime victim, the crime victim's lawful
representative, and the attorney for the Government. °* The victim or the government may appeal any denial of a victim's
right through a writ of mandamus on an expedited basis. °? The courts are also required to ensure that the crime victim is
afforded the rights in the new law. °4

These changes were intended to make the victim an independent participant in the proceedings. °° Congress desired to
modify what it viewed as the unfair treatment of crime victims; in particular, congressional sponsors of the CVRA cited the
Oklahoma City bombing case as the kind of decision that they intended the new law to overrule.

II. The Need To Place Victims' Rights in the Rules

With the CVRA in place as the law of the land, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be amended to conform to the

statute. While one court has derisively referred to the Act as mere mushy, feel good legislation, °7 it in fact substantively

changes the posture of crime victims on a whole host of issues. In the wake of the Act, victims now must be folded into the
process through which federal courts conduct criminal cases, including bail, plea, trial, and sentencing hearings. The Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure - the playbook of the federal courts - should reflect this fact.

Some might agree that victims now have a number of new rights, but nonetheless dispute the need for a rules amendment.
After all, 1t might be argued, the CVRA in fact creates substantive rights for crime victims. Because nothing in the federal
procedural [*853] rules can modify substantive rights, °° the CVRA will trump any conflicting provision in the federal rules.
°° Tn other words, the CVRA will automatically govern federal criminal proceedings even if the rules remain as written.
