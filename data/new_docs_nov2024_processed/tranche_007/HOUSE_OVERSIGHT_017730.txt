2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *861

Second, prosecutors and their agents continue dealing with victims throughout the course of a prosecution. They work with
victims in investigating the crime, identifying potential defendants, preparing the indictment, and presenting evidence to the
grand jury and at trial. Because of this working relationship, prosecutors are best situated to provide notice in most cases.
Third, most crime victims lack legal counsel and are unfamiliar with federal criminal proceedings. They may need assistance
from someone familiar with the process to understand what is happening. United States Attorneys’ offices, including the victim-
witness components in those offices, are well situated to provide that assistance. As the President's [*862] Task Force of
Victims of Crime concluded, the prosecutor is in the best position to explain to victims the legal significance of various
motions and proceedings. |34 For all these reasons, prosecutors should notify victims of their rights and of upcoming
hearings. '35 Most states that have addressed the issue follow this approach. !3°

The Justice Department appears to agree that 1t should notify victims. In the 2000 Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and
Witness Assistance, the Department required prosecutors and their [*863] agents to provide notice to crime victims. In
particular, the Guidelines currently obligate prosecutors to provide victims with the earliest possible notice of:

(a) The release or detention status of an offender or suspected offender ... .
(b) The filing of charges against a suspected offender, or the proposed dismissal of all charges ... .

(c) The scheduling, including scheduling changes and/or continuances, of each court proceeding that the victim or witness is
either required to attend or entitled to attend ... .

(d) The acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or the rendering of a verdict after trial ... .

(e) If the offender is convicted, the date set for sentencing, the sentence imposed ... . 137

35 But cf. United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 328 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (concluding that, in the absence of a national rule requiring
prosecutors to provide notice to victims, the court would direct the prosecutor to provide the name and contact information of each victim so
that the court can ensure that notice is properly given).
