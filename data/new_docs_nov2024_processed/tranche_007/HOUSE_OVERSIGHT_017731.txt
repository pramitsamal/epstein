2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *863

To avoid creating only significant new responsibilities for prosecutors and their agents, the proposed new Rule 10.1 is lifted
essentially verbatim from the 2000 Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance. The 2005 revisions to the
Guidelines continue essentially the same requirements. 148

The drafters of the CVRA also appear to believe that the notification obligations will fall primarily on prosecutors’ offices, as
the CVRA authorizes an appropriation of $ 22,000,000 over the next five fiscal years to the Office for Victims of Crime of the

139 [*864] Presumably, those enhanced new

Department of Justice for enhancement of victim notification systems.
notification systems can be used to keep victims apprised of court proceedings. Moreover, the CVRA directs that the
Department of Justice and its investigative agencies shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and
accorded, the rights described in subsection (a)._ 14°

Proposed new Rule 10.1 adds only two new obligations beyond those found in the 2000 Attorney General Guidelines: (1)
notice to victims of their right to make a statement regarding any proposed plea, and (2) notice to victims of their right to attend
public proceedings. Both of these obligations are currently found in the 2005 Guidelines. !4!

One last issue deserves brief discussion: Is it proper for the Judiciary, through the rule-making process, to command another
branch of government to take certain actions? !4? The starting point for analyzing this question is the congressional command
in the CVRA that the executive branch must protect victims' rights. ‘4? Consequently, implementing these rights through rule
changes presents no question of the courts inventing new rights or exercising some kind of supervisory power over federal
agents. '44 Instead, the implementation is simply enforcing congressionally created rights through the Judiciary's
congressionally authorized rulemaking authority - an uncontroversial exercise of judicial power. !4° Moreover, in the CVRA,
Congress commanded the courts to ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described [in the CVRA]. '4° Rule
changes needed to implement the CVRA thus rest [*865] on this statutory authority as well. Additionally, this Article's
proposals affecting prosecutors are closely connected to court proceedings; they deal with such things as prosecutors notifying
victims of hearings and conferring with victims in anticipation thereof. It is difficult to see new separation of powers concerns
arising in such contexts so closely connected to the courtroom.
