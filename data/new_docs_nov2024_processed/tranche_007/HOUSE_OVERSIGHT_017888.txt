Mar—Jac Investment, Inc., Mena Corpora-
tion, Reston Investment, Inc, Sterling
Charitable Gift Fund, Sterling Manage-
ment Group, Inc., Success Foundation, and
York Foundation.” Jd. 1224. Allegedly,
many of the entities are related by com-
mon management, few of them maintained
a physical presence at their purported
place of business, and they all “have long
acted as fully integrated components of al
Qaeda’s logistical and financial support in-
frastructure.” Jd. 191 225, 226.

Plaintiffs argue the Court has personal
jurisdiction over the SAAR Network be-
cause it participated in the conspiracy that
resulted in catastrophic effects in this dis-
trict. After an ongoing investigation in
the Eastern District of Virginia, federal
authorities raided the offices of several of
these Defendants in Herndon, Virginia in
March 2002. Jd. 1227. The investigation
has allegedly revealed that SAAR Net-
work funds have been transferred to des-
ignated terrorists and al Qaeda operatives
Youssef Nada and Ahmed Idris Nasred-
din. Jd. 1228; see Exec. Order No. 13224
(designating individuals as_ terrorists).
Additionally, Plaintiffs claim that the in-
vestigation has revealed that SAAR Net-
work entities have engaged in transactions
with Bait Ul-mal, Inc. (BMD, which has
transferred funds to terrorist organiza-
tions including al Qaeda, and materially
supported the 1998 embassy bombings in
Africa. Federal Complaint 1 229-230.

[69] At this stage, the Court must ac-
cept as true Plaintiffs’ allegations con-
cerning the relationships of the SAAR
Network. Jd. 99222, 226. Defendants
correctly argue, however, that Defendants
have provided scant basis for linking
these entities under the SAAR Network
title. Certain of these groups may be
subject to personal jurisdiction in light of
Plaintiffs’ allegation that they purposeful-
ly directing its activities at the United

States by transferring money to designat-
ed terrorists Youssef Nada and Ahmed
Idris Nasreddin, particularly if they in-
tended the money to support terrorism.
Id. 1228. Additionally, general jurisdic-
tion could be appropriate for the SAAR
Network entities having offices in Virgi-
nia. Jd. 1227. Accordingly, the SAAR
Network’s motion to dismiss is denied
without prejudice. The parties are to en-
gage in jurisdictional discovery to deter-
mine which of the Network’s entities have
a presence in Virginia and which entities
transferred money to Nada and Nasred-
din.
