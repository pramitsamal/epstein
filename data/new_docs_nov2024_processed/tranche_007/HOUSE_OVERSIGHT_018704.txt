Before Donald Trump was President, he was Donald Trump.
This is a portrait of that man.

In his first non-photography based installation, Andres Serrano
takes us on a curious and insightful tour for a closer look at who
Donald Trump is.

In a relatively short period of eight weeks with a determination
and competitive ferocity worthy of its subject, the artist has
amassed a collection of over 500 objects produced by or for
Donald Trump.

The collection is telling and varies from objects as mundane as
shirts, ties, suits, hats, jackets, ice buckets, Teddy Bears and
miniature screwdriver sets made for Donald Trump, his brand,
his casinos, his hotels, to Trump Tea, Trump Coffee, Trump Ice
Water, Trump Coca-Cola, Trump 7-Up, Trump Snapple, and
the more exotic $1,000 Trump Steaks (“The Best!”), Trump
Vodka packed in 24 carat gold plated bottles, a Trump deodorant
named “Success” and a Trump cologne called “Empire.”
In addition to the merchandise for Trump Plaza, Trump Harrah’s
Casino, Trump Marina, Trump Castle, Trump Tai Mahal,
Trump University and Trump Shuttle there are casino chips,
boxing invites, concert invites and many many more objects all
bearing the name “Trump.”

This colorful collection is mostly self-explanatory but the artist
plans to present each object with a museum-like label not unlike
in a curiosity cabinet or an anthropological study room.

Of particular interest are more than fifty magazines with Donald
Trump on the cover. Although, most of the magazines are ten,
twenty or more years old, there are some more recent ones
including a copy of The Atlantic from June 2016 with the cover
story, “The Mind Of Donald Trump,” Time Magazine’s issue
“Deal with it” from August 21, 2015 and another Time Magazine
dated March 14, 2016 with the words “bully, showman, party
crasher and demagogue” written across Donald Trump’s face.

All three magazines are signed by Donald Trump.
