Also included are several high priced special edition items made
for VIP’s such as a beautiful Taj Mahal leather jacket and a Taj
Mahal Golf Bag and Clubs as well as a 1994 Trump Castle Casino
Birthday Invitation titled, “Trump, Lord Of The Financial Jungle.”

The centerpiece of the installation is a sizable portrait of Donald
Trump taken by Andres Serrano in 2004 for his “America” series
and a giant rotating sculpture below it. The sculpture, which is
more than 10 feet tall, is the word, EGO, spelled vertically, an
elegant sign that once greeted visitors at the entrance of Trump’s
Taj Mahal Casino's Ego Lounge.

Finally, there are several board games including “Trump
Monopoly,” “The Apprentice Game” and “Trump: The Game.”

The premise of “The Game” is stated on the box.

“It's not whether you win or lose, its’ whether you win.”

There are different versions of “The Game,” including one in
French, all to be laid out in several locations in the gallery under
glass.

What kind of game was it, or 1s it? Who wins, and who loses?

That’s for the audience to decide. The artist prefers to stay neutral.

“It’s a portrait of a man painted with his own brushes,” says
Andres Serrano.
