Title: He was over 50
And they were girls

Character

Submitting Office:

He was over 50. And they were girls

If the women whom Palm Beach
police say a part-time town resident
invited to his home and paid for
sex acts were, in fact, women, the
solicitation charge against Jeffrey
Epstein might feel more sufficient.
But, according to police records,
they weren’t. He was over 50. And
they were girls.

_ 45.
16.
17-year-old girls.
That should

count for some-
thing — the dit
ference between
prostitution and
pedophilia.

So, it is baffling
that Mr. Epstein, who was indicted
last month by a grand jury on one
felony count of solicitation of pros-
titution, has not been charged, as
Palm Beach police strenuously
urged, with unlawful sex acts with
a minor and lewd and lascivious
molestation.

Conviction of crimes against mi-
nors would mean steeper penalties
than the maximum five-year prison
term Mr Epstein faces if convicted
of the single count of felony solicita-
tion. It also would help carry a mes-
sage of intolerance to perverts who
prey on girls.

Prosecutors did not pursue charg-
es against Mr. Epstein reflecting
the age of the victims because they
assumed a jury would view the girls
not as victims but as promiscuous,
untrustworthy, willing participants.
The presumption is offensive.

Mr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Man-
hattan money manager who has
hired Harvard law professor Alan
Dershowitz and defense attor
ney Jack Goldberger, has denied
knowing how old the girls were.

Jury should have decided
if Epstein is a pedophile.

But police interviews with five
alleged victims and 17 witnesses
under oath, as well as phone mes-
sages, a high school transcript and
other items that police found from
searching Mr. Epstein’s trash and
7,234-square-foot waterfront home,
provide evidence that he knew the
girls were teenagers.

One girl couldn’t show up when
Mr. Epstein wanted because she
had soccer. Another time, Mr. Ep-
stein had to wait for his “massage”
session because the girl he wanted
was still in class.

Why didn’t State Attorney Barry
Krischer let a jury decide whether
to believe the teenagers — in-
cluding a 16-year-old who went to
Mr. Epstein’s house to “work” in
December 2004 after being asked
whether she needed to make money
for Christmas gifts?

Prosecutors gave greater weight
to the details Mr. Dershowitz pro-
vided about the girls in an apparent
effort to assail their character. Mr.
Dershowitz pointed out to prosecu-
tors that some of the teenagers had
talked on myspace.com about mari-
juana and alcohol use.

The 20-year-old Royal Palm
Beach woman who told police she
recruited girls for Mr Epstein has
a Web page on myspace.com that
features one girl using the name
“Pimpin’ Made EZ.”

Although no charges of witness
tampering have been filed, the par-
ents of at least one of the teenage
victims complained to police of be-
ing followed and intimidated by two
men. Police determined that their

1

vehicles were registered to two pri-
vate investigators. Mr. Goldberger
denied knowing anything about it.

Police also note in their reports
that the state attorney's office of
fered Mr. Epstein a plea deal that
would have placed him on proba-
tion for five years, allowing him
ultimately to walk away with no
criminal record at all.

I asked Mr. Krischer’s spokes-
man, Mike Edmondson, why the
case was referred to a grand jury in-

‘stead of Mr. Epstein being charged

and facing a trial before a jury. And
shouldn’t the victims’ credibility
be a factor to determine whether a
crime’s been committed, not wheth-
er a jury will convict? (After all, as
Mr. Goldberger told The Palm Beach
Post of Mr. Epstein, “He's never de-
nied girls came to the house.”)

Especially, I asked Mr. Edmond-
son to explain: Why shouldn’t the
public look at this case and think
there are two kinds of justice — one
for the wealthy and one for the rest
of us?

Mr. Edmondson said he could

not comment on the case because it °
is active, but on the latter point, he |

offered, for the sake of “philosophi-
cal debate”: “Whether wealth buys a
different standard of justice across

the country ... the answer to that _

would, of course, be yes.”

But in this case, he said, “regard-
less of the battery of attorneys, the
outcome would be the same. Every
issue that was debated in public was
debated in our office before this
case went to the grand jury.”

In this case, it is not the victims’
credibility but the state attorney's
that deserves questioning.
