Attorney: Police gave media ‘distorted view’

bm EPSTEIN fom 1B

They did that Monday via Gold-
berger and a Los Angeles publicist
for Miami criminal defense attorney
_ Roy Black, who also has represented

Epstein in the case.

“We just think there has been a
distorted view of this case in the me-
dia presented by the Palm Beach po-
lice,” Goldberger said.

Reiter has consistently declined
to comment on the case and did not
respond to a request for comment
Monday.

The implication that State Attor-
ney Barry Krischer was easy on Ep-
stein by presenting the case to a
grand jury rather than filing charges

directly against him is wrong, Gold-
berger said.

The Palm Beach Police Depart
ment was “happy and ecstatic” that
the panel was going to review the
evidence. “I think what happened is
they weren't happy with the result.
They decided to use the press to
embarrass Mr. Epstein.”

But records show that Reiter
wrote Krischer on May 1 — well be-
fore the case went to the grand jury —
suggesting that Krischer “consider if
good and sufficient reason exists to
require your disqualification from the
prosecution of these cases.”

Rather than flat-out decline to
charge Epstein, Krischer referred
the case to the grand fury to “ap-

pease” the chief, Goldberger said.

A state attorney’s spokesman
would say only that the office refers
cases to the grand jury when there
are issues with the viability of the
evidence or witnesses’ credibility.

Both the state attorney and the
grand jury concluded there was not
sufficient evidence that Epstein had
sex with minors, according to Gold-
berger. “It was just a childish perfor-
mance by the Palm Beach Police
Department,” Goldberger said.

The defense attorney said one of
the alleged victims who claimed she
was a minor was in fact over the age
of 18. Another alleged victim who
was subpoenaed to testify to the
grand jury failed to do so. Epstein’s

accusers, he added, have histories of
drug abuse and thefts. “These wom-
en are liars. We've established that.”

But why would they all invent
their stories about meeting Epstein
for sexual massages?

“I don't have an answer as to what
was the motivation for these women
to come forward and make these al-
legations,” Goldberger said.
