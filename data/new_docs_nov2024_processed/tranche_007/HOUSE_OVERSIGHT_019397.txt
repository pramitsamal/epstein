Course Requirements:

e Midterm: Wednesday October 14 (in-class, closed book; but exam will provide most of the
basic formulas you might require, to lessen need for memorization). Analytical problems
on the exam will closely parallel material covered in problem sets (but will generally
require much less algebra), and the essay problem will relate to a central topic covered
extensively in class.

e Final: The final will have a larger essay component than the mid-term. The final will draw
on the entire course, though any technical material on the final will be closely related to
material covered in Problem Set III.

e Short policy paper: You will be asked to write a short policy paper on a topic drawn from
a list of questions relating to reform of the international monetary system. A one-page

outline of your paper is due on Wednesday,
Fale Eo RECESS. and the complete paper is due on Monday

These papers will form the basis for class discussions and (depending on class size) in-
class presentations during the final four meetings of the class. The papers are intended to
be short and succinct—there is an absolute total page limit of 10 double-spaced (12 pt.)
pages (roughly 2500 words): Only figures and references are excluded in this limit. Zhe
papers do not need to include any formal analytical or econometric analysis; you may
write them in a style you find suitable to the question you are addressing. The final exam
will include (a choice of) essay questions relating to the paper topics that you and your
classmates have chosen.

e Problems: There will be 3 problem sets, due Sept 14, Oct. 5 and Nov 16.
