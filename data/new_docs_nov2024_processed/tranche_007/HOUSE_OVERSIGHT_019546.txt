58 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS

CryptoParty, Tor station, and other anti-NSA activities could go
unremarked upon. After all, ten or so NSA workers attended the
first party, and it is not unlikely that many of them recognized
him as their co-worker. If so, they knew (as did Sandvik and Mills)
that the Tor advocate “Cincinnatus” was Snowden. He had also not
been shy in contacting notable enemies of the NSA via e-mail, such
as Jacob Appelbaum, Parker Higgins, and Asher Wolf. If anyone,
including the security staff of the NSA, had been on the lookout for
dissident intelligence workers, this well-advertised gathering and its
organizer might have been of interest.

In 2014, I asked a former top NSA executive whether such activi-
ties on behalf of Tor by an NSA employee would arouse the atten-
tion of the NSA’s own “Q” counterespionage unit. He answered,
“Snowden was not an NSA employee.” Because Snowden was a
contract employee of Dell’s residing in the United States, the NSA
could not legally monitor his private activities or intercept his com-
munication. To do so would require a court-approved FBI request. So
Snowden/Cincinnatus was free to operate openly in recruiting NSA

© workers, hacktivists, and computer buffs for his events. Ironically, ©
adversary intelligence services searching for disgruntled intelligence
workers had no such constraints.
