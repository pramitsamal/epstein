Reduce Our Dignity to That of Tagged Animals,” Guardian, May 3, 2016.

299 a distrustful press: Pilkington and Watt, “NSA Surveillance Played Little Role
in Foiling Terror Plots, Experts Say.” The first “expert” was Michael Dowling, a
Denver-based attorney who acted as Zazi’s defense counsel. He said he had no
access to the undisclosed basis of the government position because Zazi pleaded
guilty in 2011. The second expert was David Davis, a British MP, who was in the
shadow government of the Conservative Party. He resigned from the shadow
government in June 2008, more than a year before the Zazi arrest. In any case,
because the PRISM program was a closely held secret, he would not have had,
and does not claim to have had, access to it.

299 Snowden speaks “truth to power”: Vanden Heuvel and Cohen, “Snowden
Speaks.”
