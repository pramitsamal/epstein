1) High Expenses — however measured, the costs are high:
a) total dollars; b) share of GDP relative to other countries;
c) cost relative to ability to pay (government, business, or
individual), and

nurses, patients, and healthcare professionals identify
opportunities for more efficient communication, data sharing
and cost saving.
