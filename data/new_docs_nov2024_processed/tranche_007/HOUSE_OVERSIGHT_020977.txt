Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Variables in Restructuring Medicare &

Medicaid to Reduce Material Impact on USA Inc.’s Expenses

Mathematical Illustrations* Slide 273-274
1) Medicare benefits — reduce them by 53% (or cap them)? or

2) Medicare tax rate — increase it by 4 percentage points?

Policy Options Slide 275-328

1) Combination of mathematical illustrations — reduce benefits and/or increase
taxes? and/or

2) Isolate and address the drivers of medical cost inflation? and
3) Improve efficiency / productivity of healthcare system? and
4) Reduce services for some Medicaid beneficiaries? and

5) Consider / implement CBO’s 26 policy options that could reduce annual
budget deficit by up to 38%?** and/or

6) Consider / Implement National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and
Reform’s medium- and long-term policy options***

Note: *Each mathematical illustration would bring Medicare Part A into long-term (75-year) actuarial balance. There is no mathematical illustration for

Medicaid or Medicare Part B & D as there’s no ‘dedicated’ funding.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Mathematical Illustrations*

Mathematical Illustrations*
1) Medicare benefits — reduce / cap them?
or

2) Medicare tax rate — increase it?

Note: *For mathematical illustrations, we simply calculate how big a revenue increase AND / OR expense decrease each major entitlement program needs
to reach financial break-even. These calculations are merely mechanical illustrations and are not meant to portray realistic solutions.
