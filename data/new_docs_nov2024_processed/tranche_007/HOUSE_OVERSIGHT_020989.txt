Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors —

Employer and Government Funding System Separates Consumers from
True Costs of Healthcare

e When one doesn’t pay directly and gets an expensive good / service for
free (or well below cost), one tends to consume more - it’s basic supply
and demand economics.

e Count up the subsidies:

— Medicaid: 47 million (24MM children / 12MM low-income adults / 7MM
disabled / 4MM elderly) Americans (15% of population) each received $6,872
in taxpayer funds, on average, for healthcare in 2008 through Medicaid. That
$6,872 equals ~19% of annual per-capita income for Americans.

— Medicare: 45 million elderly Americans (15% of population) averaged $7,991
per person for healthcare in 2008 ($4,875 for hospital care; $3,116 for medical
insurance and prescription drugs). That equals ~23% of annual per capita
income.

— Private Market: 157mm Americans with private health coverage (subsidized
by employers) in 2008 paid just 16% of the total premium cost themselves for
single coverage and 27% for family coverage. In effect, that represented tax-
free “earnings” of $3,951 for singles or $9,256 for families (not including the
tax savings on their personal premium contributions).

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors—

Healthcare Providers Are Rewarded for Driving Revenue

¢ While striving to provide the best care possible, healthcare
providers tend to have financial / legal / societal incentives to
provide more care, all else equal.

¢« Reimbursement for providers is generally volume-based (e.g., more
procedures generate more revenue for care providers), though there
are efforts to increasingly focus on quality.

Unlike car buyers, for example, who often disregard a dealer’s
maxed-out model and choose only the features that are important to
them and what they can afford, healthcare buyers tend to buy all the
“features” as: 1) buyers (patients in this case) are typically not
medical experts, so they defer to doctors / care providers for
decisions; and 2) buyers only bear a small portion of the costs as
someone else (employer or government) is paying for the features.
