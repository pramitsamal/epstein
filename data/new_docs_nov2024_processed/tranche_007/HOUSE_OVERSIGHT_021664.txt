Judge rules Epstein attorneys
can subpoena abortion records

By JANE MUSGRAVE

Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

WEST PALM BEACH — In
a decision that could spark
a constitutional showdown
over privacy rights, a judge
Tuesday gave lawyers rep-
resenting multimillionaire
sex offender Jeffrey Ep-
stein the right to subpoena
abortion records from
women who are seeking
millions in damages from
the part-time Palm Beach
resident.

Palm Beach County
Circuit Judge Donald
Hafele said the records
could help Epstein rebut
the women’s claims that
they suffered psychologi-
cal ills after being paid to
give him sexually-charged
massages at his Palm
Beach mansion when they
were as‘young as 14. -

Hafele told Epstein’s.at-
.torneys they couldn’t go on
a fishing expedition. The

_ medical records, he said,
can’t be sought until the
women are asked whether
they have ever had an

abortion, how many and’

where. Further, he said,
the records .would not be

made public and might not
be admissible during trial.

But, he said, since the
women claim Epstein,
now 57, is responsible for

. their emotional’ distress,

his attorneys can explore
the impact of other events.
Medical records, Hafele
said, are a better source
of information than a
person's memory.

Attorney Louis Silver,
who represents the Presi-
dential Women’s Health
Center, a West Palm Beach
clinic where abortions are
performed, warned Hafele
that he was stepping
on shaky constitutional
grounds,

“These records are
protected by our consti-
tutional right of privacy,”
he said, referring’ to the
Florida Constitution.

After the. hearing, Sil-
ver said an appeal won’t be
necessary until Epstein at-

torneys seek the records.

In another ruling
Wednesday, Hafele also
said that videos from
depositions in the state
cases can't be released
without a court order. The
ruling came after Epstein

attorney Robert Critton.

complained that a. video
of Epstein being asked
whether he had an “egg-
shaped” penis became a
youtube.com sensation. It
first appeared on The Palm
Beach Post Web site.
Critton blamed attorney
Spencer Kuvin for releas-
ing it. Kuvin said it was

“public record.

The civil suits began
mounting after Epstein
agreed to plead guilty to
two state charges: procur-
ing aminor for prostitution
and soliciting prostitution.
He served 13 months of
an 18-month sentence. As
part of the deal brokered
with federal prosecutors,
he agreed not to contest

the accusations.in the civil '

lawsuits. He can argue the
women don’t deserve the
millions they are seeking.
