A. Okay.

Q. Had any other young woman told you she had
been abused by Professor Dershowitz?

A. No other young women had told me that, no.

Q. Had, as of that date, had anyone told you
that Professor Dershowitz had abused other minors?

MS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object for a
moment here to the extent that you're going to be
answering a question that requires you to divulge
any attorney/client communication with Virginia
Roberts, I have a standing objection that I'm
putting on the record right now.

Virginia Roberts does not waive her
attorney/client privilege with her lawyers, and
they are not entitled to testify as to
information that she intended to be confidential
that she communicated to her lawyers.

MR. SCAROLA: And I would instruct you not to
answer the question on that basis.

MR. SIMPSON: All right.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. I disagree with the position on the
privilege, but I will -- you're going to follow the
instruction not to answer those questions?

A. I am.
