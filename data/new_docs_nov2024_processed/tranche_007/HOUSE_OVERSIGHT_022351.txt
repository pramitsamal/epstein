A sale to an IDGT is a tax-efficient way to transfer future appreciation of an asset
Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (“IDGT”)

e Grantor makes arm’s length sale of assets to an irrevocable trust

e Grantor receives a note for the fair market value of the asset plus interest at current AFR

e Grantor pays income taxes generated by trust assets

e After the note is paid, remaining trust assets pass to heirs gift tax free

e Additional considerations
— trust should be “pre-funded” by grantor to provide sufficient coverage for the note
— having the loan guaranteed by trust beneficiaries may be beneficial
— advisable to allocate GST exemption to trust in order to maximize benefit to heirs
