with the goal of putting up a chic high-rise on the site. It’s markedly cheaper than
Extell’s deal, in part because Icon started assembling properties in 2007. (Icon is
working on a second high-rise as well as a shorter rental building in the same neck of
the woods.)

Just look to other data and the same trend emerges. In 2010, Yorkville’s median sale
price was $663,500, according to real estate listings site StreetEasy. Compare that to
the first seven months of this year — it’s 14 percent higher, at $757,500. But remember,
the sub-market remains cheaper relative to the Upper East Side at large, which boasts
a year-to-date median of $1.15 million.
