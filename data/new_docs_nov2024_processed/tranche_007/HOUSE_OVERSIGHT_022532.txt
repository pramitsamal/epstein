company. No enforcement action was taken against the suc-
cessor, but the predecessor company pleaded guilty to one
count of violating the FCPA and agreed to pay a $2 million
fine.'” Later, four executives from the predecessor company
were convicted of FCPA violations, three of whom received
terms of imprisonment.”

On occasion, when an enforcement action has
been taken against a predecessor company, the succes-
sor seeks assurances that it will not be subject to a future
enforcement action. In one such case, a Dutch predeces-
sor resolved FCPA charges with DOJ through a deferred
prosecution agreement.’ While both the predecessor
and successor signed the agreement, which included a
commitment to ongoing cooperation and an improved
compliance program, only the predecessor company was
charged; in signing the agreement, the successor company
gained the certainty of conditional release from criminal
liability, even though it was not being pursued for FCPA
violations.!”> In another case, after a Connecticut-based
company uncovered FCPA violations by a California
company it sought to acquire, both companies voluntarily
disclosed the conduct to DOJ and SEC.'% The prede-
cessor company resolved its criminal liability through a
non-prosecution agreement with DOJ that included an
$800,000 monetary penalty and also settled with SEC,
paying a total of $1.1 million in disgorgement, pre-judg-
ment interest, and civil penalties. The successor company
proceeded with the acquisition and separately entered
into a non-prosecution agreement with DOJ in which it
agreed, among other things, to ensure full performance of
the predecessor company’s non-prosecution agreement.
This agreement provided certainty to the successor con-
cerning its FCPA liability. '””

Importantly, a successor company’s voluntary disclo-
sure, appropriate due diligence, and implementation of an
effective compliance program may also decrease the likeli-
hood of an enforcement action regarding an acquired com-
pany’s post-acquisition conduct when pre-acquisition due

diligence is not possible.!”*
