Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly engaged in sexual activity with underage girls at his
waterfront Palm Beach home on El Brillo Way, according to police in the Town of
Palm Beach. Epstein also owns residences in New York City and the U.S. Virgin

Islands, among other locales. Emily Michot emichot@miamiherald.com

April: Palm Beach police begin trash pulls at Epstein’s home, discovering a
telephone message for Epstein with the girl’s name on it, and a time that matched
the time that she told police she was there. They find the names and phone numbers
of other girls on message slips in his trash.

October: With the police probe in full swing, one of Epstein’s assistants calls one of
the girls just as she is being questioned by police. Investigators begin interviewing
more girls, as well as Epstein’s butlers, who tell them that Epstein had frequent
visits from girls throughout the day. On Oct. 20, they execute a search warrant at his
house on El Brillo Way in Palm Beach.

May: Police sign a probable cause affidavit charging Epstein and two of his
assistants with multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor. The Palm Beach
state attorney, Barry Krischer, instead refers the case to a grand jury.
