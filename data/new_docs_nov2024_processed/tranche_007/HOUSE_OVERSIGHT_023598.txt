Rationale

Buy EEM puts financed by a basket of EM puts to lever near record low correl

Hedge the China tech bubble; Tencent unlikely to stand still after a 45% rally YTD

Hedge the upside into MSCI announcement on 20-Jun

lead to near-term consolidation

BofAML Equity & Credit strategists highlight they favour equities over HY credit as div yields have
surpassed HY credit yield & equities offer more gearing to rising PMI's, earnings and FCF

Stock replace FANG stocks

Lever extremely depressed FANG volatility and low correlation to buy upside

HSl is unlikely to outperform if AS51 drops more than 10%; HSI vol below AS51 vol
