Cognitive Process-Based Education 13

I want to teach kids to date and drive better. What kind of school is
that?

But this trivializes the point. I do want to teach students to date
and drive better. But these are just a few instantiations of general cog-
nitive processes. Forming human relationships and figuring out what
is going in the physical world are two of many very important cogni-
tive abilities that manifest themselves in myriad ways in real life.

A properly designed school system needs to focus on cognitive
abilities, not scholarly subjects. Kids will recognize instantly that these
activities are the ones they know how to do and that they need to get
better at. If we allow them to choose what areas of knowledge they
would like to focus on while learning these skills, they would be atten-
tive and interested students. No more ADHD. Poof!

A society that organized schools around cognitive abilities would
become one where people were used to thinking about what they did
and how and why they did it. They would not find school stressful or
boring.

This wouldn’t be a bad thing.
