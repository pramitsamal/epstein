Global economic outlook - Summary

Key questions

e Can emerging markets (EM) continue to offset developed market (DM) weakness to buoy global
growth?

e What are the risks of near-term faltering of the US economic recovery?

e When is the European economy likely to return to sustainable economic expansion?

CIO View (Probability: 60%*)

¢ Global economic activity remains moderate; the growth impulse stems largely (some 80%) from the EM
region. As expected, China started to ease monetary policy. The country is better placed than other EM
and particularly DM countries to counter growth weakness with further monetary and fiscal stimuli. Thus,
we expect EM growth to stabilize soon and pick up in 2H 2012.

e US economic indicators have on balance been disappointing recently, especially data related to business
fixed investment and employment growth. Thus, we lowered our 2Q 2012 real GDP growth forecast to an
annualized rate of 1.5% from 2%. We still expect growth slightly above 2% in 2H 2012. We think that the
risk that the Fed will take measures in addition to the extension of Operation Twist is still significant.

e Large parts of Western Europe are in recession or stagnation. We expect the economies of the Eurozone
and the UK to show mild improvement in 2H 2012. Still, economic activity is likely to remain very sluggish
despite support from lower oil prices and less rigorous fiscal austerity. The Bank of England may support
the UK economy by increasing its amount of bond purchases soon. The probability that the ECB will take
further action to support the economy has risen significantly.

A” Positive scenario (Probability: 15%*)

e The Eurozone crisis abates. Financial market conditions recover, mitigating the drag from fiscal austerity.
¢ Growth in Western Europe is marginally positive (Eurozone stagnates) in 2012 and the US economy
grows moderately above trend.

i Negative scenario (Probability: 25%*)

e There are three key downside risks to the global economy: 1. a significant escalation of the Eurozone
debt crisis; 2. a sharp fiscal contraction in the US, and 3. a sharp deceleration of the Chinese economy. Each
one of these risks could precipitate a significant downturn of the global economy.
