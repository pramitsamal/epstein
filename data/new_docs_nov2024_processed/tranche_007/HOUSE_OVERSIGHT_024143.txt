Key financial market driver 1 - Eurozone crisis

Key questions

e What is the way forward for Eurozone banks?

e What is the most likely course of events in Spain, Italy and Portugal?
¢ In what direction will the economy and the ECB go?

ClO View (Probability: 65%*) Austerity and weak growth
¢ Support for the banking sector is a major political agenda item, and the request for external support for
Spanish banks can be seen as the starting point for greater European support and oversight for banks, to
be discussed at the upcoming European Council.

¢ Greece's debt remains unsustainable, but the risk of a euro exit over the next six months has diminished
after the 17 June elections, which have produced a viable government coalition. The Troika may only
accept moderate adjustments to the second Greek package. Portugal is likely to receive an increased
bailout package and is unlikely to default in 2012. Progress on reforms and consolidation in Spain and Italy
is most crucial for the near-term development of the crisis. Risk premiums would rise strongly on any
failure to meet deficit targets; we expect bond risk premiums to remain elevated for Spain and Italy over
the next six months.

¢ Following stagnation in 1Q 2012, economic surveys are commensurate with a quarterly GDP contraction
of around 0.3% at present. Business survey evidence points to a general wait and see mode. The risk to the
outlook for a stabilization of economic growth in the second half of 2012 is skewed to the downside. The
ECB remains on hold, but the bar to support the economy and markets has been lowered substantially. We
see a significant probability of policy action in early July, including the possibility of a rate reduction.
Despite all the talk about political measures to support growth and increased tolerance for budget
slippages, there is practically no leeway for fiscal stimuli. The near-term growth impact of any fiscal
measure will at best be marginal, in our view.

A Positive scenario (Probability: 15%*)

¢ Bond yields are contained, as peripheral countries' budgets stay on track and economic activity recovers
faster than expected. Greece fully complies with the austerity plans and receives further support. Market
confidence is restored, and economic growth stagnates in 2012.

& Negative scenario (Probability: 20%*) Major shock
¢ Major shocks could include Spain being pushed into a full IMF/EU program, possibly by a rating cut to
junk, enhancing pressure also on Italy; serious political disagreement in core countries (for instance after
Dutch elections, etc.); a possible Portuguese default; a Greek euro exit; or a major external growth shock.
