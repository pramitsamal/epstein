The most important energy developments of 2012: how countries are planning for Independence Day

I:_ What might US energy independence look like?
Rising crude oil production in Texas and North Dakota has contributed to a reversal of the long-term US production decline.
The latest data (June 2012) show North Dakota now ahead of Alaska’s North Slope.

The growth in US domestic production is notable, but on its own insufficient to result in energy independence since the US still
imports ~9 mm bpd of oil. But when combined with other factors affecting demand and supply, the concept of energy
independence comes into view over the next couple of decades. What is “energy independence”? After some adjustments
(and I may be underestimating some of them), US net imports could fall to 4-5 mm bpd, a level which can be met by imports
from countries with historically reliable economic and political linkages to the US (everything is relative). The point is not that
reduced US crude imports will lower oil prices; countries like China with growing oil needs may offset that. What matters
here are the economic and geopolitical benefits from (a) not having to design military and foreign policy objectives based
on energy security to the degree the US has over the last 30 years’, and (b) being able to reap the growth, employment
and current account benefits of domestically sourced-oil and natural gas.

> See “Addicted to Oil: Strategic Implications of American Oil Policy” from the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army. The piece
outlines 4 pillars to U.S. national interests: defense of the homeland, promotion of U.S. democratic values, creation of a favorable world
order, and enhancement of the nation’s economic well-being. According to the authors, each has been negatively impacted by US demand
for foreign oil. They believe that U.S. foreign policies that support repressive oil states are diametrically opposed to American values, and
reversed the 20 century trend of the U.S. fighting against totalitarianism and in favor of liberty, and in turn caused the U.S. to lose the “war
for ideas” that is critical to wining the “war on terror”.
