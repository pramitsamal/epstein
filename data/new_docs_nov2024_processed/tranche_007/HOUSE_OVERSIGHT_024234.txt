just oblivious to what others are thinking: a willful and
in a sense fatal tone deafness.

Press accounts recycle the mysterious billionaire
mythology—a man of vast and unsourced riches living
in a parallel universe of absolute entitlement—with brief
glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same
photos endlessly republished), and the assumption of
depravity inside.

In fact, the life in the house, without wife or
children or conventional domestic demeanor, rather
conforms to the scripted fantasies: somewhere between
Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut. There is indeed a
group of young women—in their twenties and thirties—
who act as Epstein’s support staff and companions.
Some have worked for him for many years, marrying,
having children, and continuing as part of his business
and household infrastructure. One woman, on an
afternoon when I was there, had just returned from an
around-the-world honeymoon that Epstein had arranged
for her. Some are, or have been, his romantic interests.
His present girlfriend, whom he met four years ago at a
dinner party in New York, has just graduated dental
school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a
Swedish model and Miss Universe finalist whom
Epstein has known for more than thirty years, became a
doctor—Epstein sent her to medical school—and
married hedge funder Glen Dubin. Together they
finance the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai
Hospital.
