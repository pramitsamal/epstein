* individual executive pay generally targeted at median level against comparable executive roles at an appropriate set of peer
companies, except the chief executive officer, for whom we target significantly below median level due to his significant
ownership interest in us;

* robust clawback policies permitting the recoupment of past incentive pay from executive officers in the event of certain kinds of
misconduct, and forfeiture of incentive awards in the event the executive engages in various types of conduct deemed detrimental
to Carvana’s interests, including theft or fraud against Carvana and engaging in competition with Carvana;

* no employment agreements with executive officers;

* the use of retail units sold, gross profit per unit ex-Gift and EBITDA margin ex-Gift as performance metrics, which incents
employees to increase earnings and manage net assets efficiently;

* restrictions on trading in Carvana Class A common stock to reduce insider trading compliance risk, as well as prohibitions on
pledging and hedging Carvana capital stock.

In light of these features, we conclude that the risks arising from our executive and employee compensation policies and practices are not
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.

TAX AND ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS

Carvana considers the tax and accounting aspects of the elements of compensation we offer in determining the most effective method for
compensating our executives. This includes, but is not limited to, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.
Section 162(m) generally limits the tax deduction available to public companies for annual compensation paid to the chief executive officer and certain
other named executive officers in excess of $1 million.

As a result of 2017 tax legislation, compensation paid in a fiscal year in excess of $1 million to, or on behalf of, an individual who is a “covered
employee” is not expected to be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, unless such compensation qualifies for transition relief
(relating to written binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017, which were not subsequently materially modified). Therefore, certain compensation
paid under our existing equity plans and certain of our long-term equity awards originally designed with the intent that such amounts qualify as
“performance-based” compensation may not be deductible in the future. Although the committee may consider the effect that Section 162(m) and the
potential lack of deduction for amounts paid in excess of the deduction limit may have on Carvana, the committee continues to retain flexibility to make
compensation decisions, in the exercise of its business judgment, that are based on factors that it determines to be appropriate (as determined by the
committee in its sole discretion) to enable Carvana to continue to attract, retain, reward, and motivate its highly-qualified executives. This flexibility may
include amending or modifying the design elements of our historical compensation programs.
