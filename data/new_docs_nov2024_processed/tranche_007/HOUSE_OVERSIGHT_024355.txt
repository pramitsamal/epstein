MASTER PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

In December 2016, we entered into a master purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we sell finance receivables meeting certain
underwriting criteria to certain financing partners, including Ally Bank and Ally Financial (collectively, “Ally”). On November 3, 2017, we amended this
agreement to increase the aggregate amount of principal balances of finance receivables we can sell to $1.5 billion. We amended the agreement again on
November 2, 2018 to, among other things and subject to the terms of the agreement, increase the purchase commitment to up to a maximum of $1.25 billion
of additional principal balances of finance receivables during the remaining term of the agreement.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold approximately $733.4 million in principal balances of finance receivables under the
purchase and sale agreement. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $1.1 billion of unused capacity under this agreement. The agreement was
most recently amended on January 4, 2019.

The financing partners have engaged DriveTime as servicer of the receivables purchased under this agreement. DriveTime had aggregate
earnings of $3.1 million pursuant to the agreement for performing servicing functions for the year ended December 31, 2018.

MASTER TRANSFER AGREEMENTS

In December 2016, we entered into a master transfer agreement pursuant to which we sell finance receivables meeting certain underwriting
criteria to certain financing partners (the “2016 Master Transfer Agreement’). Under the agreement, the purchaser trust agreed to purchase up to an
aggregate of $292.2 million in principal balances of finance receivables. In November 2017, we terminated the remaining capacity under the 2016 Master
Transfer Agreement and replaced this facility by entering into a new master transfer agreement pursuant to which we sell finance receivables meeting
certain underwriting criteria to certain financing partners (the “2017 Master Transfer Agreement”). Under the agreement, the purchaser trust agreed to
purchase up to an aggregate of $357.1 million in principal balances of finance receivables.

On November 2, 2018, we amended the 2017 Master Transfer Agreement to, among other things and subject to the terms of the agreement,
increase and extend the trust’s commitment to purchase finance receivables from us. The trust’s currently available financing following the amendment
permits up to $454.5 million in principal balances of finance receivables to be purchased, and the 2017 Master Transfer Agreement’s purchase commitment
contemplates the trust securing up to three times the currently available financing in the aggregate.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold approximately $348.8 million in principal balances of finance receivables under the 2017
Master Transfer Agreement prior to the amendment in November, excluding those that were part of the refinancing transactions described below under
“Refinancing Transfer Agreements”. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $454.5 million of unused capacity under 2017 Master Transfer
Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Carvana sold an aggregate of approximately $163.7 million in principal balances of finance
receivables under the 2016 Master Transfer Agreement and 2017 Master Transfer Agreement.

The purchasers engaged Carvana as the administrator of the trust and DriveTime as servicer of the receivables. In the year ended December 31,

2018, we had aggregate earnings of $4.0 thousand for performing trust administrator functions for the purchasers and DriveTime had aggregate earnings of
$4.0 million for performing servicing functions.
