to be arrested by some 600 instructors of a new course called
Introductory Police Brutality. These were from the lab notes

There was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who—long after
she had forgotten what some professor spouted during an
official lecture about Dostoevsky’ s Crime and
Punishment—would remember, with perhaps a twinge of
frightened pride, learning from a fellow demonstrator that if she
planned to go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an
act of practical feminine foresight to remove the earrings from

her pierced lobes in advance.

So, now in 2019, fighting over free speech has been
happening heavily at Berkeley campus again. Meanwhile, Trump

grabbed the pussy of the Statue of Liberty. Cava/ier, anyone?
