Along with tinctures, capsules represent one of the more mature form factors within
CBD. Mary’s looks to be squarely positioned as the most premium brand across all
companies analyzed, in particular for their Elite capsule line, which offers 150 mgs of
CBD and retails for $90. For context, the closest price paint to Mary’s comes from
Sagely Naturals at $0.17 per mg. Brands look to be very competitively priced in terms of
value, with seven of the brands coming in at $0.10 or below.

Utilizing our proprietary consumer survey, CBD capsule use looks to over-index with
males, which shows over a 10 pt delta relative to women. In addition, on a relative basis
to other form factors, CBD capsule use is more popular with younger, lower-income
consumers, which perhaps explains the notable competition seen within the value
segment.
