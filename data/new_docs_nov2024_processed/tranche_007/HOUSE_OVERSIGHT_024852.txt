COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS

February 25, 2019

Benchmarking across the topical market, we would highlight the absolute number of
brands offering a product, which while not exhaustive, provides context on the
popularity of the form factor. Similar to most other verticals, Mary's topicals fall into the
super-premium segment, which we define as anything above $0.54 per mg of CBD. Of all
the SKUs analyzed, the premium segment looks to be the narrowest, while mainstream
and value segments are the most popular price point among the competitive set.

Note: Reflects price per mg of CBD; For companies with multiple SKUs, we used a straight line average

According to our proprietary Cowen consumer survey, of respondents who use CBD,
26.2% of people use topicals as a form factor, which is the highest level seen after
tinctures. Usage among men and women look to be similar, though younger, lower
income use looks to be more prevalent when benchmarking to older, higher income
cohorts. Similar to capsules, this could reflect the large number of brands we see playing
in the value segment.
