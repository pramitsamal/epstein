YouTube, Google, and WikiLeaks.

Indeed, an exclusive Newsweek—Daily Beast poll of 1,000 Egyptians

majority (53 percent) don’t believe that al Qaeda was responsible for
the Twin Tower attacks, instead affixing blame to Israel, the U.S.

Even among the friendliest audience that could be assembled—a
class at an American-run English-language school—skepticism
reigns, and a random YouTube video carries as much weight as a
New York Times front-page story.

Such are the responses when the region’s leaders—and the press they
controlled—have systematically lied to their citizens for 30 years,
ingraining a distrust in what leaders or the media says that borders on
absolute.

But perhaps there’s also a dividend from such cynicism. Every survey
shows widespread Arab antipathy for American policy—the
Newsweek—Daily Beast poll found that only 11 percent of Egyptians
think America cares about their interests. But when you pull back the
layers, cutting through the decades of institutional demagoguery, the
