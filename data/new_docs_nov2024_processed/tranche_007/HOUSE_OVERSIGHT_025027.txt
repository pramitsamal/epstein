qualities America inspires would warm the heart of any marketing
manager.

As an ice-breaking exercise, I asked everyone I interviewed on my
trip to free-associate the first word they thought about when they hear
“America.” There were numerous cynics (“greedy,” “consumerism,”
“McDonald’s’’) and the occasional outlier (“Sex and the City”), but a
majority repeated affirmative terms like melting pot, power,
democracy, modernity. Even a majority of jaded Newsweek—Daily
Beast poll respondents said that the U.S. had a positive effect on the
world—the highest of any nation we asked about. Blend it all
together, and that’s an image of America well positioned for the new
Arab World.
