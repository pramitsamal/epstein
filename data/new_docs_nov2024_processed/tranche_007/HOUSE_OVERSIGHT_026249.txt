declassification request, consistent with established standards governing the handling of
classified information, including those under Section 3.1(d) of Executive Order 13526. Those
standards permit declassification when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any need to
protect the information. The White House review process also included input from the Office of
the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice. Consistent with this review
and these standards, the President has determined that declassification of the Memorandum is
appropriate.

Based on this assessment and in light of the significant public interest in the memorandum, the
President has authorized the declassification of the Memorandum. To be clear, the
Memorandum reflects the judgments of its congressional authors. The President understands
that oversight concerning matters related to the Memorandum may be continuing. Though the
circumstances leading to the declassification through this process are extraordinary, the
Executive Branch stands ready to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests
consistent with applicable standards and processes, including the need to protect intelligence
sources and methods.

Sincerely,
