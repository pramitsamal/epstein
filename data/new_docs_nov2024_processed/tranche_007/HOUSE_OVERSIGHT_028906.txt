iron logic, that the future of Israel
depends on our strength and our
righteousness.

Our strength — that is the IDF's might
and its strategic capabilities, the backing
of the superpowers, our economic
strength, and our social solidarity.

Our righteousness — not as an abstract
concept — 1s our capacity to hold
themoral high ground by means of a
calculated effort to behave and be
perceived as acting in good faith — to
obtain peace, even if it delays.

¢ This is also an an essential
condition for achieving internal
solidarity and the world's support for
Israel (or for the support of most of the
world that's important to us).

¢ This is also an essential condition

for achieving internal solidarity and

willingness for sacrifice in a society
where being called for battle or

routinely risking your life is not a
theoretical notion, but rather part of
our life experience that repeats itself
