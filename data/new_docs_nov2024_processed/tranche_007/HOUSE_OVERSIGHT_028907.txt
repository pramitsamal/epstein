time and again.

¢ The fighting spirit, resilience and
the internal solidarity are deeply bound
to both our strength and our
righteousness. Our righteousness is just
as important as our strength.

Our righteousness, and not our strength
in and of itself, 1s what gives Zionism's
struggle its meaning and sense of
purpose (especially for ones who can
choose). The support of a superpower

¢ and the resilience of our society
and economy, which are among the
components of our strength — will
never be without recognition of our
righteousness. And without it, they will
erode

¢ This is the time to point out the risk
in the weakening of the cohesive forces
which hold the Israeli society together.
We are turning into an increasingly
divided society whose very fabric
seems to be ripping apart, and which 1s
riddled with hatred for one another.
