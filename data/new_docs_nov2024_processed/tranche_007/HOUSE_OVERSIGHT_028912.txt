Arabia and the Gulf States, Jordan,
Egypt and perhaps even Turkey (which
is not Arab). The focal interest is the
struggle against radical Islamic
terrorism and against Iran's hegemonic
and nuclear intentions.

¢ The challenge for us is based on
there being, apparently, only one way
to achieve that; and the upcoming
elections in Israel force us to put it on
hold for a few months.

¢ And the way to do it is this: a
strong, self-confident Israel, willing to
hold serious negotiations with the
Palestinians and the group of Arab
nations within an international
conference, backed by the US and the
Quartet — in order to achieve a two-
state solution and establish a regional
agreement, while maintaining an
unyielding and persistent fight against
terrorism and ensuring the IDF's
qualitative military edge over any
combination of opponents.
