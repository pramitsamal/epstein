But in another view it is precisely because Mueller, a former
Marine, is so by the book and Semper Fi that he finds Trump's behavior
to be personally offensive, and, on its face, corrupt. Bob Mueller is all
about limits and rules. Donald Trump has none and acknowledges
none.

It may yet be even a more profound clash then that, the executive
branch at war with itself—the Justice Department against the White
House.

Indeed, it is a war strategy, in the view of some legal observers.
Such an indictment would be litigated to the hilt. It would force both the
substantive issues of obstruction and abuse of power and the meta
issues of Presidential immunity—the hot button issues of the
President's claims to being above the law—into open court for a long
and painful review and dissection that might shadow the November
election.

Legal experts believe that the Mueller team might well prevail in
lower courts with a less likely, but not at all certain outcome, in the
Supreme Court.

“Might such an expansive claim win, yes. Should it win, no. But
everyone knows the reality: weak president's lose cases, strong
president's win them.

Were the case to reach the Supreme Court after the November
election, it might well be the results of that election that help seal the
President's fate not just in Congress but also in the courts.
