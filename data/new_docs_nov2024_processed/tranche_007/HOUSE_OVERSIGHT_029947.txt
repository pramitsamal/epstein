The Rest Won't Overcome the West

Leon Hadar

July 1, 2011 -- Much has been said and written in recent years about
the growing challenge to US geo-strategic and geo-economic status
by China, BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and the other rising
global powers, including South Africa, South Korea, and Turkey.
Indeed, in the aftermath of the US military debacles in Iraq and
Afghanistan, and especially since the financial meltdown and the
ensuing Great Recession, small-time pundits as well as renowned
futurologists have been predicting that the West is basically kaput
and that the rest of the Twenty-First Century belongs to the 'Rest’. In
this scenario, China replaces the US and the global hegemonic power
sooner or later. As we study these America-is-finished-and-China-
rules-the-world forecasts, it is important to recall that not so long ago
many of the same pundits and futurologists were anticipating that
globalisation and the Internet would lead to the collapse of the nation-
state and the end of the business cycle, or that the US would
dominate a unipolar international system and bring about the triumph
of democracy and free markets worldwide.

That many of the same experts who were celebrating US
triumphalism in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the
First Gulf War have now been transformed into the prophets of
American gloom and doom, should encourage us to embrace a certain
sense of scepticism about the notion that China and the rest of the
Rest are about to take charge and that Washington will turn out to be
nothing more than a tourist attraction for Chinese and Indian tourists
in the coming years.
