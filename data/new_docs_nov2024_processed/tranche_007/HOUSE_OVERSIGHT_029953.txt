Of course, this is anathema to the U.S., particularly its navy. In this
case, the DOC or even a convention will be of little utility. Let us
hope that the real explanation is more benign. One possibility is
confusion and lack of coordination between high policy officials in
foreign affairs and the military, particularly the PLA Navy. But this
could also mean that China's foreign policy is in flux or disarray on
this issue and that the PLA Navy has emerged as a trendsetter and
spokesperson thereon.

Remember that just as U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates
arrived in January on his historic visit to China, its military tested a
stealth fighter and the civilian leadership appeared to have been
caught unawares.

If the military is on occasion acting independently of the civilian
leadership, this could explain the seeming dichotomy between
Chinese officials' words and PLA Navy actions. But this would
indeed be worrying.

In any event the situation looks likely to get worse before it gets
better. More surveys and exploratory drilling are planned in areas
claimed by China. And Vietnam has conducted an offshore live-fire
drill and has called for international — including U.S. — help to
resolve the issues. Rare anti-China protests have broken out in Hanoi
and Manila. At this point all one can say is hold on to your hat.
