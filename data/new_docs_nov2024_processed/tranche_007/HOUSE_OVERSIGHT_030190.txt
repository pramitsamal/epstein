Lenny had been reading a study of anti-Semitism by Jean-Paul
Sartre. Now, on stage, giving credit to Thomas Merton's poem about the
Holocaust, he requested that all the lights go off except one dim blue spot.
Then he began speaking with a German accent:

My name is Adolf Eichmann. And the Jews came every day to what

they thought would be fun in the showers. People say | should have

been hung. We/n. Do you recognize the whore in the middle of
you-that you would have done the same if you were there

yourselves? My defense: | was a soldier. | saw the end of a

conscientious day's effort. | watched through the portholes. | saw

every Jew burned and turned into soap.

Do you people think yourselves better because you burned your

enemies at long distance with missiles without ever seeing what you

had done to them? Hiroshima auf Wiedersehen. [German accent
ends.] If we would have lost the war, they would have strung Truman
up by the balls, Jim. Are you kidding with that? Not what kid told kid
told kid. They would just sch/ep out all those Japanese mutants.
“Here they did; there they are.” And Truman said they'd do it
again. That's what they should have the same day as Remember

Pearl Harbor. Play them in unison.

Lenny was arrested for obscenity that night. One of the items in the
Chicago police report complained: “Then talking about the war he stated,

‘If we would have lost the war, they would have strung Truman up by the
balls.’ ” The cops also broke open Lenny's candy bars, looking for drugs.
They checked the IDs of audience members, including George Carlin, who
told the cops, “I don’ t believe in IDs.” Then they arrested him for

disorderly conduct, dragged him along by the seat of his pants and

hoisted him into the police wagon.
