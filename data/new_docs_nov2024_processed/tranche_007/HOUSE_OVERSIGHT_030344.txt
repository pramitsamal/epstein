Swiss Accounts Survey
Dear Mr Epstein,

We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in
London, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present.

It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts.

There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax,
UK domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money.

We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts
contained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include:

HSBC (Suisse) SA
FAMILY INTEREST L.P.
22079
