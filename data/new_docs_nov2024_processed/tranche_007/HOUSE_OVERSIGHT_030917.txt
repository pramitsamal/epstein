Dear Professor Krauss,

We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics’ Guide to the
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein:

epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/

Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate?

If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do
with his money and his time, and support knowledge,” says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein,
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.”

Thanks,
Rebecca Watson
