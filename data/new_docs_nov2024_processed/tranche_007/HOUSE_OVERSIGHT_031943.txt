Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton underscored the shift in a

Mrs. Clinton warned.

“When unelected authorities say they want to be out of the business
of governing,” the United States expects them “to lay out a clear road
map” and “abide by it,” she added.

Clinton’s comment last month approving of the military’s extended
timetable for electing a civilian president, there was suspicion over
Washington’s intentions. The shift occurred at the same time as a
