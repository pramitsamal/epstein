HOST: Absolutely, well certainly but breaking precedent by
not having a young leader coming up behind him and we
discussed this yesterday. The transfer of Mr. Xi will remain
in power for many more years to come, perhaps revive the
position of party chairman and stick around indefinitely.

RLK: There’s no question about the power and longevity of
Xi. I would put it a little differently. I’d say that it is not
even necessary for him to have the party chairmanship or
any particular title because of his overarching power by
having his name associated with “Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” - that
whole phrase is now in the Party Constitution. Moreover, he
already had the designation of “Core” of the Party.

NO HEIR APPARENT TO CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING OW

RLK: So those two elements - name in Constitution and
Core - are totally overarching over any particular title. That
said, not having a younger member of the Standing
Committee who is an obvious candidate for future
leadership, prevents there being a separate power center
that could undermine what Xi wants to do. So the fact that
Xi will be there until, potentially, the mid-2030s is very real.
I think now we should shift our attention to what Xi Jinping
wants to do. We need to look at the policies he is putting
forth, and see what they mean for China and for the world.

HOST: And I want to touch on that in a moment, but given
this power and position afforded to him in the constitution
no less, I mean where is room for discussion?
