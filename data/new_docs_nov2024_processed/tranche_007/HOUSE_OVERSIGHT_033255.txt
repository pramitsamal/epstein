Hi Jeffrey, | was happy to meet you this morning.

You asked to see some things I’ve written. Here’s my (only slightly out of date) professional web presence, including
Letterman clip:

Here are a few stories I've written more recently that are not displayed on my site:

You might get a special kick out of this Trump story:

What kinds of media goals/story ideas are interesting to you? Masha has made it clear that she wants me to write
something about you, but that’s much more your call to make. | suggest that there is mileage to be gained by quoting you
in a story about how proper implementation of cryptocurrency might solve financial corruption issues.

| travel back to Austin, Texas tomorrow evening, but am of course reachable. Thanks again for your time this morning.

-Dylan
