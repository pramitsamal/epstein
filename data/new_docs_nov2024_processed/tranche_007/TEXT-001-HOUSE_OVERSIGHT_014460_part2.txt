Media historically outperforms when PMIs and inflation rising
The average return for Media when PMIs and inflation are both rising is 0.6% relative
but the sector has underperformed by 2% month to date. A stronger dollar is also a
positive historically for Media given that many large caps within the sector, notably
agencies, are large dollar earners. But again, the two have disconnected recently.
Valuations now at a small discount to the market
Media has de-rated by nearly four PE points (from 19.7 to 16) since the April 2015 highs
and the sector now trades on a 5% discount to its average vs the market. We think the
improving global growth backdrop will support earnings and should mean the sector can
re-rate.

Overweight Healthcare
Healthcare looks very attractively valued and we see compelling risk reward in the sector
on an outright basis at current levels. The fundamental bull case for Health rests on the
strong pipeline of new products for the big cap pharma universe. Our sector analysts
forecast EU Pharma to deliver a 2018-21E EPS CAGR of 11%, up from mid-single digit
levels in recent years. Historically that would justify a PE re-rating and a multiple for the
pharma sub-sector nearer 17-18x than the current 13x 2018 PE.
We believe the Republican clean sweep in the US elections represents a positive
catalyst as it significantly decreases the potential for legislative initiatives to
aggressively control drug pricing in the US. The catalyst for the sector to re-rate will
come progressively from newsflow around new products. The next 12 months should
see progress on this front with several of the European large caps expected to announce
key data on important drugs in 2017.

Healthcare’s forward PE is now down to just a 7% premium relative to the market and
nearing the valuation lows recorded in 2010-12 when the patent cliff was at its worst
and pipelines were very weak. Today pipelines are twice the size they were in 2011 and
innovation is the key to growth in the sector - pricing power remains strong in drug
categories with differentiated products. The new product launches expected between
2015 and 2018 add up to potential sales of $133 billion.

Overweight Utilities
The Utilities sector has suffered badly from the back up in bond yields. However,
fundamentals for the sector are actually improving relative to recent history. The sector
is the biggest direct beneficiary of corporate QE in the UK and Euro are (more than half
of the sector are eligible for the ECB’s Corporate Sector Purchase Program) meaning it
can gain more than most other sectors from potential refinancing savings. This cushions
any effect on debt costs from higher bond yields as corporate bond yields are still very
low.
Earnings and cash flow are improving. The bottoming out of the commodity cycle has
supported a turn to the upside for power prices. This has helped earning to trough and
analyst revisions have been positive throughout the last few months of
underperformance. Balance sheets and dividends in most cases now also look
sustainable. Valuation multiples for the Utilities sector are attractive relative to history
and compared to other Defensives. EV/EBITDA for the sector sits at 7.3x on Bloomberg
estimates. That is a 20% discount to the market and is near 10-year lows on a relative
basis. With dividends more secure the relative DY becomes more attractive at 2-year
highs.

Disclosures
Important Disclosures
FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).
Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*
Buy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%
Neutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%
Underperform N/A ≥ 20%
* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.
INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays
no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s
coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.
