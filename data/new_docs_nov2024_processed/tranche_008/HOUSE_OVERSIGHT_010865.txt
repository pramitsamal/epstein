A. Not -- you know, let's break that down ina
couple pieces.

The fact that his name is circled, if I were
running an FBI investigation, I'd go send somebody to
see what he knew about it, but no, it would take a fot
more for me to become suspicious that somebody is
involved in -- in sexual activity like that.

Q. Okay. So you would agree with me then, that
the fact that a person often visited the mansion, the
person -- the fact that a person was a friend of
Mr. Epstein for 15 years, the fact that the person had
stated publicly that: Mr. Epstein liked young women
almost as much as I do myself,” and the fact that the
name is circled in the address book is not sufficient to
raise a Suspicion that that person engaged in sexual
misconduct?

A. So...

Q. Yes or no. It's a yes or no question.

A. It requires --

MR. SCAROLA: You're not required to answer
yes or no, if a yes or no response alone would be
misleading.

THE WITNESS: The problem is the word
suspicion. I'm not particularly suspicious on
those facts, but it -- you know, what do you mean

by suspicion? If 1 -- if I were running an FBI
investigation and somebody circled a name as --
as saying, look, this fellow may have some
information, I'd go follow up on that.

If you say that's suspicion, then the answer
would be, yes. But I -- you know, based on that
information alone, no. I mean that -- that
wouldn't -- wouldn't be enough for me to, you
know, invest time and energy into that particular
possibility.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Okay. So none of those facts are sufficient
even to justify spending time and energy, correct?

A. Unless -- if I'm running -- this is -- again,
what do you mean by suspicion? Time and energy in the
context of somebody who is running a pro bono case with
limited resources to try to figure out what the sex
trafficking ring's going to do, I'm not going to chase
after that rabbit. It seems farfetched.

I'm going to focus my efforts on the people
who appear to be more directly involved.

Q. Okay. So based on the facts that I gave you
a moment ago, you think it's farfetched that Donald
Trump was engaged in abusing minors?

A. If that's all I had, I would not invest time

and energy in that, right.

Q. And you referred to your pro bono case. What
is your best estimate of how much money you have made
representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein?

A. In which case are we talking about now?

Q. Any -- any case representing a victim of
Jeffrey Epstein.

A. Ineed to confer with --

MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah. I'm going to object.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. And that -- that's a fact -- that's not a
privileged question. That's a factual question.

A. Factual. Well, there are -- there are --

Q. Just how much money? You don't have to tell
me who the clients are. Just how much money?

A. Okay. I need to --

MR. SIMPSON: There's a question pending. I
object to a break. There's no possible
privilege.

MR. SCAROLA: He has a privilege -- he has a
privilege question. He wants to consult with
counsel.

MR. SIMPSON: Well, really? My question is
how much money, and that's privileged?

MR. SCAROLA: It may be. I don't know. We

need to talk.

THE WITNESS: That's why I need to --

MR. SCOTT: There's no federal law or state
law that supports that financial information and
fees is privileged.

MS. McCAWLEY: We can argue about that
because that's in my motion, so we can argue
about that.

MR. SIMPSON: Well, can ~- can --

MR. SCOTT: That one, I know all about.

MR, SCAROLA: You're objecting to our taking

It is our position that the

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the video
record, 10:38.
MR. SIMPSON: With my note, we are taking a
break over my objection.
