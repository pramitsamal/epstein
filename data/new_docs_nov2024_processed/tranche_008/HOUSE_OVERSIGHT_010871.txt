A. I think it puts you on notice in the context
of a country which has required people to report the
sexual abuse of children, and somebody wants to talk to
you about your observations of a convicted sex offender
with underage girls, that that's going to be one of the
subjects that's going to be discussed, yes.
Q. My question was -- my initial question was:
Does -- do the statements in this letter put the reader
on notice that you, personally, are accused of abusing
minors yourself, not that you have in some knowledge or
evidence that someone else did it, but that you,
yourself, did it; is that a way to give fair notice?
A. Well, in fair notice in what context? You
know, is he on notice that a lawsuit is going to be
filed the next day?
Simply from that piece of -- that letter
alone, they are on notice, you know -- I mean, I think
that puts you on notice that there are serious
allegations afoot and it would be in your best interest
if you hadn't done anything, to show up, attend a
deposition, let all the facts come out so that everybody
can know them.

Q. Would you agree that accusing someone of

themselves abusing a minor is different than accusing
someone of having knowledge that somebody else did it?

A. Yes.

Q. And to accuse someone of abusing a minor is a
serious, serious accusation of criminal conduct,
personal criminal conduct, not just failing to report
somebody else, but you, yourself, are abusing people?

A. Oh, yeah.

MR. SCAROLA: Are you suggesting that that's
not criminal conduct?
MR. SIMPSON: I'm -- I'm -- my question
stands.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. What is the answer to that?

A. Itis a very serious charge, I agree. That's
why we are all here today.

Q. Okay. And -- and if you wanted to put
someone on fair notice that they are accused themselves
of being a sex offender, a criminal who has abused
children, wouldn't you tell them that?

A. That's a speculative question because that
letter was designed to try to collect information about
an international sex trafficking organization. And so
as to -- you know, I'm not going to speculate as to why
Mr. Scarola wrote it that way. But my sense, based on
the public record is, that he was trying to get as much
information as he could about what Jeffrey Epstein and

his criminal associates were doing. And he thought that
Mr. Dershowitz would have information and was trying to
collect that.

Now, whether the -- the -- the tentacles of
the organization would extend so that they wrapped
around Mr, Dershowitz himself, I guess was the subject
that -- that Mr, Scarola, I am assuming, was hoping to
explore. But Mr, Dershowitz prevented that opportunity.

Q. And Mr. Dershowitz, you knew, had been
Mr. Epstein's attorney, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you knew, just as we have seen here today
with multiple assertions of privilege, that he could not
testify about anything he learned as an attorney?

A. He could testify, and the fetter itself says,
we are not going to ask you about any communications; we
are going to ask you about observations of sex abuse by
a convicted sex offender, and your personal knowledge of
that. That would not have erased in the -- and
Mr. Scarola's a very good attorney, and I'm sure all of
his questions that we saw the last couple of days would
have been very narrowly focused on observations about
what this criminal organization was doing.

Q. And so to the bottom line is that your view,
your sworn testimony, this letter of August 23rd, 2011,

put Mr. Dershowitz, Professor Dershowitz, on fair notice
that he was being accused of being a sex offender
himself?

A. We-- we have gone over this. I think it put
him on fair notice that there were serious questions
being raised about what he knew about this criminal
organization, what the potential criminal responsibility
he had for failure to report sexual abuse of a child, as
well as other possibilities.

MR. SIMPSON: I'm going to move to strike as

nonresponsive.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. My question is a very narrow one, whether
this letter, in your opinion, under oath, fairly put
Mr. -- Professor Dershowitz on notice that he himself
was accused of abusing minors.

A. Again, that's a vague question, I've tried
to give the best answer I can. That was certainly a
potential area of questioning. I think that puts him on
notice that it would have been in his best interest to
appear to answer those questions.

MR. SIMPSON: I'm going to object to the

answer again as nonresponsive.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. It's a really simple question.
