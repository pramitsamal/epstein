present my information in more detail, including more specific descriptions of the sexual
activities with the men Epstein sent me to, I could do so.

61. Ehave directed my attorneys, Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, to pursue
all reasonable and legitimate means to have criminal charges brought against these powerful
people for the crimes they have committed against me and other girls. They are representing me
in this case pro bono.

62. Since I filed my motion in this case, my credibility has been attacked. I am telling
the truth and will not let these attacks prevent me from exposing the truth of how I was trafficked
for sex to many powerful people. These powerful people seem to think that they don’t have to
follow the same rules as everyone else. That is wrong. I hope that by coming forward, I can
help expose the problem of sex trafficking and prevent the same sort of abuse and degradation
that happened to me from happening to other girls.

63. [declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed this (a day of January, 2015.
