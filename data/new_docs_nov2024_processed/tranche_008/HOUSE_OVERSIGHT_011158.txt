Figure 3: Why the MRS in fitness equals that in preferences at evolutionary equilibrium
Fitness and utility each depend on consumption of commodities «‘!) and «?) If the MRS in fitness
did not equal that in preferences, then the isograms of the fitness function F would cross those of
the utility function U, as shown in the figure. There would then exist consumption bundles, X and
Y, such that X is preferred to Y although Y confers the higher fitness. This preference ordering
cannot be evolutionarily stable because a mutation that reversed the preference between X and Y
would be favored by selection.
