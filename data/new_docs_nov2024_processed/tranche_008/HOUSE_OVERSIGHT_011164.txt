The MRS in fitness is obtained by rearranging this expression to obtain

where
= eT r(ym®) + (1 —y)P@v)\ (6 (15)

and y = a/(a + (2) measures the relative importance of marginal fertility.

In what follows, I will take «@) = «@) so that the final term in 7 disappears. This restricts
attention to the MRS at points along the 45° line in figure 1. In intergenerational transfers there
is good reason for interest in these values. At stationary equilibrium, the consumption of an in-
dividual at age x‘ must equal that of her daughter one generation hence. Thus, intergenrational
investments are governed by the MRS in preferences along the 45° line, which must also equal the
MRS in exchange and the marginal productivity of intergenerational investment.4 These quantities
could all be predicted from the MRS in fitness along the 45° line. For transfers over shorter inter-
vals, there is less reason for concern with the MRS along the 45° line. For these cases, the present
approach will tell only part of the story.

3.1.1 The evolutionary discount function

To facilitate presentation of numerical results, I define an evolutionary discount function X, which

satisfies air
MRS p = ede *(@w)dw (16)

For example, when ) is a constant, future benefits are discounted exponentially at a constant rate.
\ can accomodate nearly any form of discounting, and is closely related to the marginal rate of
time preference (MRTP): the average value of \ over any age-interval predicts the MRTP over that
interval [15, Eqn. 15]. I calculate from age-specific fertility and survival data using the methods
described by Rogers [15].

3.1.2 Demographic statistics

Ideally, \ should be estimated using demographic statistics that reflect some sort of long-term
average of human demographic history. This, of course, is impossible. I have instead relied on
demographic statistics from modern “natural-fertility” populations, whose vital rates are thought
to resemble those of pre-industrial populations.° It would be unwise, however, to take any single
modern population as the examplar of our unknown ancestors. We do not know whether prehistoric
human demography was more similar to that of 19th century Taiwan, or that of 19th century Utah,
to name just two possibilities. Nonetheless, it seems likely that species-wide mean demographic

5A natural-fertility population is one in which birth-control is either absent, or else is applied independently of the
number of a woman’s existing children. In natural-fertility populations, women may use birth control to space births,
but they do not use it to achieve a target family size [1].
