Figure 5: Evolutionary Discount Function
A(x, y) is the average evolutionary discount rate within a five-year age interval. “Age at investment,” z,
refers to the age at which a decision is made between an immediate and a delayed benefit. “Future age,”
y, refers to ages beyond the age at investment. The dotted lines show the rate of interest predicted by
equation 10, where the generation time is Ty = 27.98 for females and 7,,, = 30.45 for males.
Based on male and female fertility of 19th century Utah Mormons [6], and on the Model West life table
(mortality level 12, e§ = 47.5 for females and 44.5 for males).
