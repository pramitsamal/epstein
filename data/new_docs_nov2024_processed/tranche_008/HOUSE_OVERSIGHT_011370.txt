relate to plaintiff and said that those stories ar vidence of
her damaged reputation. When you look at the stories that

actually were pulled off the internet, a substantial number of

them relate to the Cassell-Edwards-—Dershowitz litigation; what

happened in the litigation, statements made by the parties in

the litigation, statements made about Virginia Giuffre relevant

to that litigation.
If her reputation is damaged by some other litigation
that has nothing to do with Ms. Maxwell, Ms. Maxwell can't be

responsible for that reputational damage.

THE COURT: What's your explanation of the damage

caused to Giuffre by the Dershowitz case?

MS. MENNINGER: I'm sorry?

THE COURT: I understand the testimony part. That's a

different kind of thing. But the case itself, how does that

damage her reputation?

MS. MENNINGER: It's the press attendant to that case,

your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. So the press attendant.

MS. MENNINGER: There was a lot of press attendant to

that case which was, frankly, negative to the plaintiff that
had nothing do with Ms. Maxwell's denial. And their experts
have relied on that press and claimed that that press somehow
supports their claim for damages against Ms. Maxwell, even

though she's not mentioned in the particular stories.
