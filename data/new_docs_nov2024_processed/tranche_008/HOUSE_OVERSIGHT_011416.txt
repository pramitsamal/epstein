we're not offering any of this for the truth of the matter
asserted. So 87 pages of police reports, a hundred pages or
however many there are of trash, you know, witness transcripts,

and read every single case that plaintiff's counsel cited for
this proposition that it is state of mind, and what's great

about these cases, frankly, every single one of them, whoever

the statement is being introduced on behalf of, or against,

knows about the statement. So when you look at their papers,

they cite United States v. Gotti for the proposition that it
goes to state of mind. Well, you know who Mr. Gotti is, and

Mr. Gotti was charged with witness tampering. Mr. Gotti wanted

to introduce some wiretapped statements that the FBI had, where

he was talking to an informant and telling the informant things
