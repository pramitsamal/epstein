Judge Johnson has duty next week.

Jay — [hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by Monday. I will not miss my
indictment date when this has dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fail apart, be left in
a less advantageous position than before the negotiations. [ have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page
indictment sitting on the shelf since May to engage in these negotiations. There has to be an ending date,
and that date is Monday.

Barry is available Monday morning. Our most flexible West Palm Beach magistrate is on duty
on Monday, so, assuming we have signed documents by 1:30 or so, we should be able to get Mr.
Epstein arraigned on Monday. I doubt that we will be able to get everything finished up here,
get down to Miami, and try to find a Miami mag by close of business on Monday.
