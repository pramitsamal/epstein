RE: Proposed Letter to Speciat Master

ORES 1 = =

Good morning, Jay. We need to resolve the attorney issue today. It has been
weeks since execution of the contract, and there is no need for further delay.

As far as the five attorney names that we will be providing, I propose Bert
Ocariz, Katherine Ezell at Podhurst Orseck, Stuart Grossman, Ed Rogers, and
Walter Cobath.

If you would like to use the same Special Master to resolve fees disputes as
well as to handie the selection of the attorney, I would recommend that we use
retired llth Circuit Judge Joseph Hatchett instead of Judge Davis because of
Judge Davis's heaith problems. (No one has contacted Judge Hatchett yet, but
one of the District Judges in Miami mentioned him as a good choice.)

I am available for a conference call between 9:00 and 10:00, and between 3:15
and 6:00. Please call me on my cell and let me know which of
those times works best for you.

Thank you.

Marie - I, too, am interested in speed. But I really need to go over this and
then discuss with Jeffrey. So please do not send this to any Special Master
’ before we discuss.the next steps. ;
