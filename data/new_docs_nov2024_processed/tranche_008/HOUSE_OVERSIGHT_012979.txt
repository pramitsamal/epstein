4.2 Symbolic Cognitive Architectures 63

4.2.4 NARS

Pei Wang’s NARS logic [Wan06] played a large role in the development of PLN, CogPrime’s
uncertain logic component, a relationship that is discussed in depth in [GMIH08] and won’t
be re-emphasized here. However, NARS is more than just an uncertain logic, it is also an
overall cognitive architecture (which is centered on NARS logic, but also includes other aspects).
CogPrime bears little relation to NARS except in the specific similarities between PLN logic
and NARS logic, but, the other aspects of NARS are worth briefly recounting here.

NARS is formulated as a system for processing tasks, where a task consists of a question or a
piece of new knowledge. The architecture is focused on declarative knowledge, but some pieces
of knowledge may be associated with executable procedures, which allows NARS to carry out
control activities (in roughly the same way that a Prolog program can).

At any given time a NARS system contains

e working memory: a small set of tasks which are active, kept for a short time, and closely
related to new questions and new knowledge

e long-term memory: a huge set of knowledge which is passive, kept for a long time, and not
necessarily related to current questions and knowledge

The working and long term memory spaces of NARS may each be thought of as a set of
chunks, where each chunk consists of a set of tasks and a set of knowledge. NARS’s basic
cognitive process is:

choose a chunk

choose a task from that chunk

choose a piece of knowledge from that chunk
use the task and knowledge to do inference
send the new tasks to corresponding chunks

Depending on the nature of the task and knowledge, the inference involved may be one of
the following:

e if the task is a question, and the knowledge happens to be an answer to the question, a
copy of the knowledge is generated as a new task

backward inference

revision (merging two pieces of knowledge with the same form but different truth value)
forward inference

execution of a procedure associated with a piece of knowledge

Unlike many other systems, NARS doesn’t decide what type of inference is used to process
a task when the task is accepted, but works in a data-driven way — that is, it is the task and
knowledge that dynamically determine what type of inference will be carried out

The “choice” processes mentioned above are done via assigning relative priorities to

e chunks (where they are called activity)
e tasks (where they are called urgency)
e knowledge (where they are called importance)
