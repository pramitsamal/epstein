328 A Glossary

It’s different from the software architecture, though of course certain cognitive architectures
and certain software architectures fit more naturally together.

e Cognitive Cycle: The basic “loop” of operations that an OpenCog system, used to control
an agent interacting with a world, goes through rapidly each subjective moment.” Typically
a cognitive cycle should be completed in a second or less. It minimally involves perceiving
data from the world, storing data in memory, and deciding what if any new actions need
to be taken based on the data perceived. It may also involve other processes like deliber-
ative thinking or metacognition. Not all OpenCog processing needs to take place within a
cognitive cycle.

e Cognitive Schematic: An implication of the form Context AND Procedure IMPLIES
goal”. Learning and utilization of these is key to CogPrime’s cognitive process.

e Cognitive Synergy: The phenomenon by which different cognitive processes, controlling a
single agent, work together in such a way as to help each other be more intelligent. Typically,
if one has cognitive processes that are individually susceptible to combinatorial explosions,
cognitive synergy involves coupling them together in such a way that they can help one
another overcome each other’s internal combinatorial explosions. The CogPrime design is
reliant on the hypothesis that its key learning algorithms will display dramatic cognitive
synergy when utilized for agent control in appropriate environments.

e CogPrime : The name for the AGI design presented in this book, which is designed specifi-
cally for implementation within the OpenCog software framework (and this implementation
is OpenCogPrime).

e CogServer: A piece of software, within OpenCog, that wraps up an Atomspace and a
number of MindAgents, along with other mechanisms like a Scheduler for controlling the
activity of the MindAgents, and code for important and exporting data from the Atomspace.

e Cognitive Equation: The principle, identified in Ben Goertzel’s 1994 book Chaotic
Logic, that minds are collections of pattern-recognition elements, that work by iteratively
recognizing patterns in each other and then embodying these patterns as new system ele-
ments. This is seen as distinguishing mind from self-organization” in general, as the latter
is not so focused on continual pattern recognition. Colloquially this means that a mind is
a system continually creating itself via recognizing patterns in itself.”

e Combo: The programming language used internally by MOSES to represent the programs
it evolves. SchemaNodes may refer to Combo programs, whether the latter are learned via
MOSES or via some other means. The textual realization of Combo resembles LISP with
less syntactic sugar. Internally a Combo program is represented as a program tree.

e Composer: In the PLN design, a rule is denoted a composer if it needs premises for
generating its consequent. See generator.

e CogBuntu: an Ubuntu Linux remix that contains all required packages and tools to test
and develop OpenCog.

e Concept Creation: A general term for cognitive processes that create new ConceptNodes,
PredicateNodes or concept maps representing new concepts.

e Conceptual Blending: A process of creating new concepts via judiciously combining
pieces of old concepts. This may occur in OpenCog in many ways, among them the explicit
use of a ConceptBlending MindAgent, that blends two or more ConceptNodes into a new
one.

e Confidence: A component of an OpenCog/PLN TruthValue, which is a scaling into the
interval [0,1] of the weight of evidence associated with a truth value. In the simplest case
(of a probabilistic Simple Truth Value), one uses confidence c = n / (n+k), where n is
