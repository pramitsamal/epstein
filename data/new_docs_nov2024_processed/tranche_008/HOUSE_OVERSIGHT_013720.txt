The number and variety of algorithmic strategies for computing Lyapounov
exponents that are applicable to real data divide naturally into those that compute

directly the average rate of separation of neighboring points from the “fiduciary”

orbit, as observed on the reconstructed attractor, from which only the largest 2can
be obtained (Wolf et al, 1985), and a variety of techniques based on assumed
model maps of the unknown flow along which the sequential products of the local
derivatives are computed. The logarithms of the straight line slopes of the sequence
of directionally decomposed local tangent vectors multiplied, yield as many
Lyapounov exponents as directions (Sano and Sawaka, 1985; Eckmann et al, 1986;
Geist et al, 1990). The techniques of regularization by which these model processes
approximate the unknown flow include those with least squares, linear fit
assumptions (Eckmann et al, 1986; Sato et al, 1987; Buzug et al, 1990), more
detailed fits involving polynomial expressions in higher powers (Briggs, 1990; Brown
et al, 1991; Bryant et al, 1991) and techniques such as “singular value
decomposition” which decomposes the flow into orthogonal components before
computing the logarithmic rate of divergence of nearby points on each of them
(Stoop and Parisi, 1991). A clever check on the Lyapounov number obtained is to
study the flow backwards so that, for example, some rate of separation of points in
the forward direction would approximate the rate of convergence in the time
reversed data (Parlitz, 1992).

Among the sources of spurious Lyapounov exponents are sample lengths
that are too short and/or too measurement-noisy to compute a statistically stable
average, embedding dimensions that are too high or low and attractors (many of
physiological relevance) that have geometric features such as sharp corners or tight
folds as in the Réssler (where points gather) or delicate boundary points such as
those on the body on the Lorenz butterfly (see above) where very small distances
determine whether the orbit makes big jumps to the right or left wing leading to
uncharacteristically large separations. This “nonuniformity” in the rates of expansion
and contraction in the dynamics over the attractor, a source of error in computations
of statistical indices of the average behavior, becomes a _ useful tool in

characterizing individual differences in sets of neurobiological data ranging from
