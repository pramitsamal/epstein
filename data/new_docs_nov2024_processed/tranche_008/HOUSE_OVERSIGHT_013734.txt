discriminate normal subjects from those with early glaucoma, but the reconstructed
attractor of the steady state visual cortical response to full field flicker demonstrated
a statistically significant decrease in D2 (Schmeisser et al, 1993). Marginal
qualitative differences in optokinetic nystagmus were quantitatively significant when
studied as the Dz of the attractor’s points in patients with vertigo compared with
controls (Aasen et al, 1997). Reconstructions of maximum velocity waves from

Doppler studies of middle cerebral artery hemodynamics (using phase random
“controls”) demonstrated an increase in D2 (and a decrease in 4(+) correlated with

age in an adult population (Keuner et al, 1996; Vliegen et al, 1996). D2 served as a
sensitive descriptor of functional changes in the EMG from the surface of the biceps
muscle, increasing with muscle load and rate of flexion and extension and
decreasing with muscle fatigue (Rapp et al, 1993; Nieminen and Takala, 1996;
Gupta et al, 1997), suggesting its use in suspected early myotonic dystrophies and
myasthenias. Reconstructed time series of stomatognathic motions in high school
students with temporomandipular joint syndromes compared with those with
malocclusion revealed a specific decrease in Doin the plane of horizontal motion in
the former (Morinushi et al, 1998). Time series of plasma growth hormone levels in
acromegalic patients with functioning pituitary adenomas manifested a statistically
significant increase in Do when compared with age-matched controls (Mandell and
Selz, 1997) which corresponded nicely to the reduction in “approximate entropy”
(Pincus, 1991a) computed on this same data set (Hartman et al, 1994). On the
other hand, comparative in vitro studies of growth hormone release patterns in
normal rat pituitary cells and their neoplastically transformed relatives, the GH3
strain, demonstrate a decrease in Do in the latter (Guillemin et al, 1983; Mandell,
1986).

The number of examples of the use of D2 on orbital point geometries in
explorations of physiological and pharmacological regulation are increasing. The D2
of respiratory rhythms is higher with intact vagal afferents than without (Sammon
and Bruce, 1991). Histamine induced an increase in Dz in the attractor point
distribution of rabbit ear artery vasomotion, attributed to calcium-activated

membrane potassium channels in that TEA prevented and reversed the change
