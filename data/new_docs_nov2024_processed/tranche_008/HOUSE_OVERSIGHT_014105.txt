12. Copies of any and all documents evidencing that Jane Doe #3 “has also told lies about
many world leaders” as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn Declaration of Alan M.
Dershowitz.

RESPONSE:

Defendant objects to this Document Request because it misstates paragraph 8 of the sworn
Declaration of Alan M. Dershowitz, which expressly states that “on information and belief, [Jane
Doe #3] has also told lies about many world leaders.” (Emphasis added). Defendant further
objects to this Document Request because it seeks documents already in Plaintiffs’ possession
and/or that are publicly available. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing specific
objections and the General Objections, Defendant responds by reference to statements by Jane

Doe #3 reflected in the media, which are equally available to Plaintiffs.

13. Copies of any and all documents evidencing that “the State Attorney in Palm Beach
County dropped a case that she sought to bring based on an assessment by the investigating
detective regarding the ‘victim’s lack of credibility’” including a copy of the letter reflecting this
decision as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn Declaration of Alan M. Dershowitz.
