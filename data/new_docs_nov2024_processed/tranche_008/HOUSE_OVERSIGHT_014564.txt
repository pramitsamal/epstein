Outlook | Investment Strategy Group 31

The risks of cyberattacks continue to increase.

To date, the attacks have had limited detrimental
impact on the broad US economy, but the impact
could be far-reaching if foreign governments such
as Russia or China, criminal entities, or lone actors
attack critical infrastructure in the US or any other
major country.

China Submerges Under Its Debt Burden and
Capital Outflows
At $11.4 trillion, China is the second-largest
economy in the world, with a 13.8% share of
global exports and a 9.7% share of global imports.
It accounts for nearly half of global
demand for zinc, tin, steel, copper and
nickel, and more than half for thermal
coal, aluminum and iron ore. Any major
slowdown or volatility across bond,
currency and equity markets in China,
including Hong Kong, would have major
ramifications for the rest of the world.
While the US has limited direct
economic exposure to China—only 0.6%
of exports as a share of GDP, 0.6%
of bank assets and 0.7% of corporate
profits—any shocks in China will
reverberate through US financial markets.
As shown earlier in Exhibit 18 on page
19, US financial conditions tightened by
118 basis points in the summer of 2015
