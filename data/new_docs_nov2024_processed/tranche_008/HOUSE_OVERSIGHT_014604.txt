Of course, a more constructive view of high
yield fundamentals does not necessarily suggest
robust returns. In high yield bonds, today’s below-
average spreads already reflect our subdued default
expectations and are less likely to offset any further
increase in rates. We thus expect returns of around
4% in the year ahead. Although high yield energy
is likely to generate similar gains, the potential
upside is more significant given wider starting
spreads and the potential for distressed bonds to
pull to par amid higher oil prices. Finally, with a
5% return, bank loans should perform marginally
better than bonds, reflecting their attractive
0.25-year duration and continued investor demand
for floating rates—a feature that is back in vogue
now that 3-month LIBOR is almost above the
1% LIBOR floor that more than 90% of bank
loans possess.

While these returns may pale in comparison to
those of last year, they remain attractive relative to
investment grade fixed income, where we expect
rising rates to generate lower returns. Even if rates
stagnate while US growth remains positive, the
default-adjusted return in high yield should still
trump high-quality bonds. Said differently, US
corporate high yield credit remains a better house
in a bad fixed income neighborhood, supporting
our modest overweight recommendation.

European Bonds

Unlike their US counterparts, European fixed
income markets did not forfeit all their gains by
the end of last year. This served as a poignant
reminder of how divergent monetary policies
can shape returns. Three ECB actions in March
drove this robust relative performance. First,
the ECB reversed its prior commitment to avoid
