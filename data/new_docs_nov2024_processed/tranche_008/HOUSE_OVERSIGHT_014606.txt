represent a headwind this year (see Exhibit

91). Meanwhile, any boost to emerging market
exports from the modest pickup in global growth
we expect is likely to be dwarfed by ongoing US
trade policy uncertainty, European political risk
and China fears. Lastly, an acceleration of recent
outflows from EMLD markets could magnify these
risks, particularly since 60% of the cumulative
inflows into the asset class since 2004 are
experiencing losses at current market levels.

Although the number of concerns is large, so is
the risk premium of the asset class. As previously
seen in Exhibit 76, the currencies in the EMLD
index are 15% undervalued. From this starting
point, the asset class could deliver attractive total
returns if US trade policy proves to be more benign
than feared and China worries abate.

Considering this balance of risks, our central
case calls for low single-digit returns. While
positive, this return is not sufficient to justify
a tactical long position in EMLD in our view,
given the still considerable downside risks
discussed above.

Emerging Market Dollar Debt

Emerging market dollar debt (EMD) returned 10%
in 2016, capping a surprising four-year period

of outperformance that has greatly benefited

from stable US rates and dollar strength. But the
prospects for a fifth year of upside are questionable
for several reasons.

First, EMD’s almost seven-year duration is
a liability in a rising-rate environment. This is
particularly true now that the Federal Reserve
has resumed tightening policy, a fact evident in
EMD’s 4.3% drop in response to increasing rate
hike expectations late last year. Second, with
spreads standing near two-year lows, there is scope
for spread widening based on US and European
policy uncertainty and renewed China growth
fears. Third, countries accounting for 37% of
EMD— including Mexico, China, South Africa
and Brazil—have negative outlooks from at least
two rating agencies, raising the potential for
downgrades.! A potential default by Venezuela
and its national oil company could also sour
sentiment, as could unfavorable tariffs or trade
restrictions from the new US administration.
Finally, the backup in interest rates we expect
could raise funding costs for EM corporate issuers,
which could also heighten concerns about spillover
into EMD. Indeed, a recent stress test by Standard
& Poor’s revealed that EM corporate borrowers—
who must repay $200 billion per year through
2020'*°—are twice as susceptible to downgrades
as US corporates if dollar funding costs rise by
a third.17?

Based on the above, we do not recommend a
tactical position in EMD at this time.
