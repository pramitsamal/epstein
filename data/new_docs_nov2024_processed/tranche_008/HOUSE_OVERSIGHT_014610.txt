The same could be said of continued outflows
from gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We
estimate that a net 280 tonnes of gold ETF
holdings—an amount even larger than the 210
tonnes of ETF outflows that pressured gold prices
in late 2016—were purchased over the past year
at levels above today’s price. Absent a rebound
in gold prices, these ETF holders might prefer to
realize their losses and rotate into instruments with
a yield component. Value-minded investors should
also consider that gold prices remains well above
their long-term average (see Exhibit 100).

Despite this challenging outlook, a number
of factors could still buoy gold prices in the year
ahead. Emerging market central banks have
continued to buy gold to diversify their reserves.
Moreover, the stronger global growth we expect
could lift jewelry demand, particularly in gold’s
two largest end markets—China and India. Finally,
gold’s allure as an inflation hedge could come back
into focus if the market begins to worry about
economic overheating in the US, although this is
not our base case.

In light of these crosscurrents, we are tactically
neutral on gold at this time.
