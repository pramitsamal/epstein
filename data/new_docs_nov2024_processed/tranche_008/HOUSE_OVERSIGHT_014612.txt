2017 OUTLOOK

In Closing

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE COMING YEAR WILL BRING AN END
to the prolonged run of positive performance for either the
US economy or the bull market for equities. Despite greater
uncertainties, including those tied to a new US administration,
the policy backdrop in the US will likely prove particularly
favorable for the economy, with looser fiscal policy, still easy
monetary policy and a lighter regulatory burden. As these
factors diminish the probability of recession in 2017, they
also support the case for clients remaining invested in global
equities at their strategic allocation. We believe US equity
gains are likely to be modest but still more attractive than the
comparable returns of investment alternatives such as cash
and bonds. And, as last year demonstrated, US equities often
surprise to the upside.

While we see the glass as half-full, there is no shortage of
risks—some of which have high probability and uncertain
impact for the year ahead—that could cause our forecasts for
the economy and asset class returns to miss the mark.

As always, we will adjust and communicate our views
accordingly should the economic, financial or geopolitical
backdrop change materially over the course of 2017.
