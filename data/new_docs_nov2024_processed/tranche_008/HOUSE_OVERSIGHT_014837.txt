question.

Roberts' lawyers says the latest allegations do not contend the fact she was used for underage sex.

Attorney Sigrid McCawleysaid : To say that our client acquiesced in this abuse, or that the abuse was OK because
she was paid for it — leaves out the fact that this is why we have laws in the United States to protect minor children
who are groomed and sexually trafficked by adults.

Epstein served 13 months in a Florida prison after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.

Allegations: The 31-year-old is currently in the midst of a lawsuit claiming she was recruited to join Epstein's harem
of underage women in 1999, naming Prince Andrew and attorney Alan Dershowitz as two of the men she was made
to 'service'

The scandal resurfaced in January when Roberts named Prince Andrew in a lawsuit, accusing him of using her for
underage sex.

According to court records connected with Roberts’ current lawsuit, she maintains that she was recruited to join
Epstein's harem in 1999 by his friend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.

She says during the three years she worked for Epstein, she was made to entertain his friends and named Prince
Andrew and Dershowitz as two men she had sex with.

Both men have denied having sex with Roberts, and Dershowitz is trying to get his name removed from the suit,
claiming Roberts made the entire story up.
