Here comes the governor of New York. See him eat the potato
knish. He wants to get a divorce. He will establish residence in another
state. But then he can’ t be governor. Instead he will get a divorce in New
York. But you know what that means. Dirty, dirty. Some deserving Young
Republican girl will get the assignment. This is known as _ political
patronage. The governor has a horny dilemma, though. Either he commits

scandal or he commits perjury. Maybe he will propose a new law.
