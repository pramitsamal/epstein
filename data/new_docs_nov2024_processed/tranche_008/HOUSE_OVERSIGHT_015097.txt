Whittaker Chambers, against Senator Joseph McCarthy and against J.
Edgar Hoover. In that vein, gossips used to rant about Hoover and Clyde
Tolson double-dating with Charles “Bebe” Rebozo and myself.

Neither Rebozo nor! are “gay.” We have been very close friends
since 1950. What we enjoy most about each other’ s company is the fact
that small talk becomes unnecessary. We are not afraid of silence. But we
have never had any kind of sexual relationship.

We were introduced by Senator George Smathers, who was
infamous for supplying female companions to his fellow legislators. It was
Smathers who eventually sent Mary Jo Kopechne to be with Senator
Edward Kennedy.

Whenever | was in Florida, | would stay with Bebe, and he would
occasionally get a couple of beautiful $200-a-night girls. Or as they would
be called nowadays, $200-a-night women. But when | bought my own
home in Key Biscayne, then his yacht became our rendezvous site.

| was certainly not promiscuous, but | had been a virgin until
marriage. | proposed to Pat Ryan the very same night | met her. She
refused, but | was a determined son-of-a-gun. | even drove her to Los
Angeles when she dated other men while | waited in the wings. | finally

charmed her with my perseverance and self-effacement.
