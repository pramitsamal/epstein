task had been assigned to Tony Ulasewicz immediately after their first
story on the break-in was published in the Washington Post.

It was strange. Ehrlichman’ s own first assignment had been to spy
on the Nelson Rockefeller people for us during the 1960 campaign, and
now he had his own chain of command. | have noticed that Ehrlichman’ s
brow has become more knitted as he has advanced in his career. When he
left, | opened the sealed envelope and read the report. It was brief:

Bernstein, Carl: Heavy pot smoker. Living apart trom his wife. Began
affair with Nora Ephron, Esquire columnist, in New York while her husband,
Dan Greenburg, book author, was at EST, Erhard Seminar Training.

Woodward, Bob: A loner. Clean as a hound’ s tooth. So far.

Then | began to “chop the coke,” as they say, with a razor blade.
When Bob Haldeman entered, we each took a couple of snorts. Haldeman
was my Sherman Adams. | had always felt | could depend on him. We were
discussing whether my itinerary for an upcoming trip to the West Coast
might include Ely, Nevada, which was the birthplace of Mrs. Nixon,

“That’ s perfect,” Haldeman said. “We need anything we can get,
PR-wise.”
“But you know something, Bob? It’ s all image.”

“Well, that is precisely the purpose of public relations.”
