“To understand humanity,” Icke continued, “you have really got
to understand humanists reptilian past, reptilian inherited genetics. One of
the most ancient parts of the human brain is known by science as the R
complex, for reptilian brain. We get these traits—cold-blooded behavior,
ritualistic behavior, desire for top-down power over structures. Now,
dismiss the reptilian thing—let’ s just think they don’ t exist—I have just
described the basic mentality of the Illuminati that allows wars to be
created, millions of casualties without any emotional attachment to
consequences. Why do people who have more money than they could
spend in a thousand lifetimes go on accumulating it? Why do corporations
that have enormous power and control over vast areas go on
accumulating and seeking more and more power and control?”

So, then, is this whole reptilian agenda really just a metaphor for the
varieties of human cruelty? Or does Icke mean it all literally?

Previously, Jordan Maxwell had told the audience, “I think the
dirtiest, the filthiest, the most licentious people on the face of the earth are
the British royalty. They represent in the human race all that is evil and all
that is filthy and degenerate. And that’ s why Princess Diana is dead.”
That there was a conspiracy behind Diana’ s death seems to be a given

among this crowd: the royal bloodline protected by the paparazzi.
