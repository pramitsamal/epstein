valve for them, on how far things are going.”

On my return fight the next morning, | found myself reminiscing
about the 1987-88 TV season, when | had been a writer and on-air
commentator on 7he Wilton North Report, a nightly satirical hour on the
Fox network that lasted only 21 shows. Critics blamed the hosts, a pair of
disc jockeys who were not untalented but who were deliberately chosen
for their inoffensiveness.

| had previously suggested as host Conan O’ Brien, a writer on the
show who also did the audience warm-ups. “No,” said the producer,

“he’ s not professional enough.” Ellen DeGeneres? “Too dykey.” Chris
rock? “Too raw.” Rosie O' Donnell? “Who wants to look at her every
night?” Richard Belzer? “Too reptilian.” Belzer is a conspiracy researcher
as well as a comedian and actor, but little did he ever dream that
ultimately he—his reptilian self—could be the culmination of his own

investigation.
