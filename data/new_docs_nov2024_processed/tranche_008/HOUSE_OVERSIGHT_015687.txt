Preface X1il
Beliefs

e We have true free will. We consciously decide our actions and
these decisions are in no way predetermined. We shape the
future. Allowing for free will is, therefore, a boundary condition
for any theory of our Universe.

* The world is an amazing place, but understandable. We can
understand the Universe through the application of thought and
reason.

* ‘There is only one Universe and it appears to make sense.

* Humans think creatively, computers do not.

* ‘The process of understanding and communication is complex,
much more complex than the digital theorems of Claude
Shannon and Harry Nyquist.

« Understanding is hard.

« The communication of understanding is even harder.
