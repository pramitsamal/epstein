At the beginning of the chapter, I said Garry Kasparov was once
thought to be one of the most intelligent people on the planet. When
his IQ was eventually tested — the German magazine Der Spiegel put up
the money — he scored 135. That means, in academic terms, he is smart
but no genius. Yet, he is undoubtedly a genius by any common sense
definition: the best chess player to ever live. These days he involves himself
in politics rather than chess and is still uniquely able to concentrate for
long periods of time. Concentration seems a very important factor.
Einstein was once asked where his genius came from. He replied that
he did not consider himself a genius but instead put his success down to
his persistence and ability to concentrate on a problem for many years.

1Q tests say nothing of our ability to concentrate over extended periods
and nothing about our drive to change the world. The tests are, at best,
a useful but dangerous diagnostic tool for educators. One of the worst
things IQ can do is pigeonhole people. Would Kasparov have become
world champion if he had been given his IQ score of 135 as a teenager
rather than late in his thirties after he had conquered the world?
