Kittens & Gorillas 159

Unfortunately, it turns out the AIDS virus can even mutate its functional
parts, but this is harder. The probability of a successful functional
mutation is 1000 times less likely than a simple aesthetic mutation to the
sugar coat.

Triple drug therapy works by attacking three different functional
elements of the virus simultaneously. It is possible for the virus to modify
all these functional elements but the likelihood of it doing so is tiny.
One mutation alone does not help because the drug cocktail will still
target the other two elements and kill the virus. The AIDS virus does not
understand that it is facing a triple drug cocktail. It cannot reason like a
sentient being and random chance is not sufficient to make the big leap
necessary to overcome the cocktail of drugs. Unless you can mutate all
three elements at once your time as a virus particle on this planet is over.
Most problems we have to solve in this world require more than one
simultaneous logical step and these don't happen by chance.
