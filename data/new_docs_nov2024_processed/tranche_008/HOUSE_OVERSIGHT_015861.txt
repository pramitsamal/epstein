Chaos

in 1987 with the publication of James Gleick’s book Chaos. It’s

Cm is the twin of complexity. It burst into the public psyche

not a difficult concept to grasp. Complex systems can be formed
using simple rules, and very small changes in starting conditions can
profoundly affect future events. I experience this if I miss my train to
work in the morning: 30 seconds either way will change the whole
pattern of my day, the people I meet and the level of stress I experience.

I’m sure you can think of similar experiences.

Henri Poincaré, a French
mathematician, first studied the
effect back in 1880. Poincaré was
trying to solve an old mathematical
problem called the Three Body
Problem originally set by Isaac
Newton. Take the Earth, Mars and
the Sun. These three bodies orbit
each other, or strictly speaking a
point in space somewhere between
them. Is there an equation that
will tell you where the bodies will
be in, say, 100 years’ time?

The answer is surprising,
no. The three bodies will orbit in
a non-repeating way. There is no
analytical short cut, no equation
that will predict where they will be
