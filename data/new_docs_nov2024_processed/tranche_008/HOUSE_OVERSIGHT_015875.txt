Now, a very clever or annoying student asks, “What happens if an
infinite number of infinitely large buses arrive at the hotel. Can they all
fit in?” The mathematical question is “does infinity times infinity, equal
infinity?” Let us ask all the guests to get out of the bus and line up in the
parking lot in neat rows. Passengers from bus one in line 1, those from
bus 2 in line 2, and so on. All the guests now form a two-dimensional
grid. We already know how to map a two-dimensional grid to one-
dimension using the zigzag method. We can fit them all in the hotel and
we are done!

Is Anything Larger than Infinity?
Is there any bus or combination of buses that would cause the manager
of Hilbert’s Hotel a problem.

The answer is yes and it involves a subtle change to the contents of
the bus.

An infinite number of buses turn up but this time the buses are
filled with men and women. The hotel manager is asked to put everyone
in a room and once again he obliges using the zigzag method.

At the end of the process the tour guide comes to him. “I think you
have missed some people,’ he says. “Since I am just one person, I know
you can fit me in. But, I have a whole bus in the car park you completely
missed.”

“No,” says the manager. “I did every bus.”

Infinity Plus Infinity Equals Infinity
