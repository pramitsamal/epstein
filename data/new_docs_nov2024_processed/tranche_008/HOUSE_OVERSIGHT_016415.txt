“Huge, huge upside that you’re not going to get if you build a strip mall in Topeka,” said
Terri Adler, managing partner of law firm Duval & Stachenfeld LLP, who also spoke at the
event.

Yet the Bronx faces a formidable problem: It’s competing with other zones across the city,
including waterfronts in Brooklyn and Queens with stronger momentum. The tax break
Bronx officials hope will rejuvenate their borough may instead lure more money to what
looks like a safer bet across the river.

In November, Amazon.com Inc. selected Long Island City for its next headquarters.
Portions of that Queens neighborhood, including a former plastics factory the retailer
plans to occupy, are inside opportunity zones, even though they’re among the city’s fastest-
growing areas. In 2017, more apartments were built there than in any other neighborhood
in the city.

Driving Alabama

Alex Flachsbart, 30, has a lot of time to talk when he’s in his SUV crisscrossing Alabama. A
lawyer who specialized in economic development grants and tax breaks, he quit his job last
year to start Opportunity Alabama, aiming to connect capital to worthy projects. For the
past several months, he’s been educating people about opportunity zones, speaking to
local officials, businesses and investors.

“T have done the OZ PowerPoint God knows how many times,” Flachsbart, who grew up in
the Bay Area, said from behind the wheel one day in December.
