MR. SCAROLA: Objection to the form of the
question.

THE WITNESS: What kind of funds are you
talking about?
BY MS. HADDAD:

Q. In genera] from the firm. When you say
equity shareholders, I understand that's you and Stu.
What I'm saying is, if you had someone else that was
named as a shareholder, why did you call them a
shareholder as opposed to a partner?

A. lt was a title of prestige and achievement.

Q. So it was basically an ego thing, it had
nothing really to do with the finances or hierarchy of
the firm?

A. They got paid more generally, but it did not
have anything to do with distributions.
