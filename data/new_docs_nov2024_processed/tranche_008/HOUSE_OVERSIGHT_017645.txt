to be given real world application. To be sure, it is a broad right - akin to the defendant's broad right to due process of law. °!
But to implement that right in the criminal rules is not creating new victims rights not based upon the statute, as the Advisory
Committee puts it, but simply implementing a clearly articulated congressional command.

It is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that effect must be given to every word ina statute. °* Under the Advisory
Committee's approach, the congressional directive that crime victims be treated fairly will have no effect on [*875] any of the
Rules. The fairness directive will, in other words, be rendered mere surplusage - something that the Supreme Court has
repeatedly cautioned against. ®?

The Advisory Committee also admits that it is interpreting the CVRA narrowly, contrary to the standard rule that remedial
legislation is to be construed broadly. °4

In addition, the Advisory Committee's approach flouts the declared intentions of the Act's drafters. There is no need to guess
about Congress's intent on the right of fairness. Senator Kyl, who cosponsored the CVRA with Senator Feinstein, explained
quite directly that Congress meant for the right to have substantive content:

The broad rights articulated in this section [section 8, mandating victims be treated with fairness along with dignity and
respect] are meant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just be aspirational. One of these rights is the right to be
treated with fairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process. 8°
Nor is there any doubt that Congress intended this command to reach the judiciary, including judicial branch components like
the Advisory Committee. Again, Senator Kyl specifically addressed this point:

Too often victims of crime experience a secondary victimization at the hands of the criminal justice system. This provision
[section 8] is intended to direct government agencies and employees, whether they are in executive or judicial branches, to treat
victims of crime with the respect they deserve and to afford them due process. *®

The Advisory Committee's decision not to treat fairness as an enforceable right is so at odds with the CVRA's legislative
history that one becomes curious as to why the Advisory Committee determined not to follow it. The Advisory Committee also
diverged from the legislative history in several other areas. 7 In reviewing the Advisory Committee's records, however,
notably absent is any mention of legislative intent. The Advisory Committee does not cite the statute's [*876] legislative
