representative. To eliminate any doubt about the ability of corporate entities to assert their interests, the Rules should be
amended to clearly state that a victim's representative can enforce victims' rights. '73

Rule 2 - Fairness to Victims The Proposals:
I proposed amending Rule 2 to require fairness to victims in construing the Rules as follows:

These rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in
procedure and fairness in administration to the government, defendants, and victims, and to eliminate unjustifiable expense and
delay. 134

The Advisory Committee did not propose amending Rule 2. !*°
Discussion:

To assure that crime victims are treated fairly throughout the process, it makes sense to add language incorporating crime
victims in Rule 2 - the one rule that specifically mentions fairness. As discussed in the previous Part of this Article, the
Advisory Committee does not agree that the Rules should be amended to protect a victim's right to fairness and for this reason,
presumably, declined to amend Rule 2. The qualifier presumably is needed here because the CVRA Subcommittee did not
give an explanation for declining to follow my recommendation here. 146

The fairness issues appears to be the fundamental difference between my approach and the Advisory Committee's approach -
the Rules are either going to treat crime victims fairly or not. As discussed in the previous Part of this Article, they should.

But even those who share my view on fairness might nonetheless argue that Rule 2 need not be amended because it is an
interpretive rule with no substantive effect. After all, it could be argued, the rule simply calls for a just determination of
criminal cases, arguably a symbolic command. And, in any event, that command might be flexible enough to encompass crime
victims.

[*884] The debate about how Rule 2 ought to read is, however, about more than symbols. In 1946, the initial chairman of the

Advisory Committee called Rule 2 the most important rule of the whole set. !37 Rule 2 has been cited by a number of courts,

138 including the Supreme Court. !39 Rule 2 has consequences. Not only does it set[] forth a principle of interpretation for

judge could not require the wrongdoers to pay restitution ... .); United States v. Kirkland, 853 F.2d 1243, 1246 (5th Cir. 1988) (Non-human
entities ... can be victims! entitled to restitution ... .); see also United States v. Lincoln, 277 F.3d 1112, 1113-14 (9th Cir. 2002) (discussing
18 U.S.C. § 3664, which specifically recognizes the United States as a possible victim for restitution purposes).

133 The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has proposed adding a “factfinding hearing for determining who qualifies as a
victim under the CVRA. This novel and cumbersome proposal is discussed below. See infra notes 546-547 and accompanying text
(discussing Proposed Rule 60(b)).
