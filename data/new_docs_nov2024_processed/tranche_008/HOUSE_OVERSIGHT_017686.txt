2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *932

In addition, an independent basis for victims reviewing presentence reports is the victim's broad right under the CVRA to be

treated with fairness 4°? and right to restitution, as I argued in my earlier article. 4

Thus, the CVRA should be understood as giving victims the right to relevant information in the presentence report about the
Guidelines and to be heard before a court makes any final conclusions about Guidelines calculations and other sentencing
matters. Many states follow a similar approach and give victims access to presentence reports as part of the victim-impact
process. 404

Since I made my proposal, the Ninth Circuit has considered the question of whether to reverse a district court that declined to
provide the entire presentence report to a fraud victim. In an opinion containing only one substantive paragraph, the Ninth
Circuit affirmed the district court, which had rejected a victim's argument that the CVRA confers a general right for crime
victims to obtain [*933] disclosure of the [presentence report]. 405 The Ninth Circuit stated tersely that the district court did
not commit legal error. 40°

Although strong arguments can be made against Kenna, 4°” the case is not on point to my proposal. First, Kenna involved a
claim of a general right to access to the presentence report, apparently untethered to any particular need for access. My
amendment would be limited to situations where victims seek relevant contents of the presentence report to make a victim
impact statement at sentencing. Second, the victim in Kenna sought the entire presentence report. The Ninth Circuit pointedly
observed: We note that Kenna refused the district court's offer to consider disclosure of specific portions of the [presentence
report]. 4°8 My proposal tracks what the district court offered to Kenna - that a victim would have access to relevant contents
of the presentence report.

Because victims have a right of access to relevant parts of the presentence report, the question then arises of how to provide
that access. In my earlier article, I recommended the simplest solution to the competing concerns would be to disclose the
report, upon request, to victims through the prosecutor. The prosecutor could filter out irrelevant confidential information and
assist the victim by highlighting critical parts of the report. It might be objected that this approach would burden prosecutors.
