2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *937

Focusing specifically on the issue of victim impact information, the [*938] Third Circuit 1s correct that, under the current
rules, it is unworkable to provide advance notice of upward (or downward 44) departures based on victim allocution at the
sentencing hearing. Under my proposal, however, victims would be integrated into the presentence process for determining
Guidelines issues, thereby ensuring that the defense has fair notice of any upward departure and the government has fair notice
of any downward departure. Regardless of whether the Guidelines are advisory, this is the fairest way to proceed for
defendants, the prosecution, and victims.

(New) Rule 32(1)(4) - Victims' Right to be Reasonably Heard at Sentencing The Proposals:

Even before passage of the CVRA, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure gave victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse
the right to be heard at sentencing. After the CVRA extended such rights to all victims, I proposed simply striking the limitation
in the rule so that it would apply to all victims as follows:

(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is
present at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence ... . 434

The Advisory Committee tracked my change of striking the crimes of violence and sexual abuse limitation; but the Committee
also substituted language from the CVRA about being reasonably heard as follows:

(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is

present at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence to be reasonably heard.
435

[*939] Discussion:

My proposal retained the current language in Rule 32 allowing the victim to speak or submit any information about the
sentence; the Advisory Committee would allow the victim to be reasonably heard at sentencing - language lifted from the
CVRA.

In this area, the Advisory Committee has paradoxically used the CVRA as an occasion for possibly restricting victims’ rights.
Under Rule 32()(4)'s current language, there is no doubt that the victim could speak at sentencing (that is, give an oral
statement). Under the proposed language, litigation could result about whether victims could be reasonably heard without
being allowed to speak (that is, be confined to purely written submissions). Indeed, during the Advisory Committee meeting on
the proposal, the Advisory Committee reporter conceded that courts would have to construe exactly what [the phrase] meant
as situations came before them. °°

It is worth reflecting for a moment on how backward the Advisory Committee's approach to this issue is. Before the CVRA's
enactment, victims of crimes of violence and sexual assault had the right under Rule 32(1) to speak at sentencing (along with
the right to submit information). When Congress enacted the CVRA, the Advisory Committee and the Judicial Conference had

(11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Vampire Nation, 451 F.3d 189, 195-98 (3d Cir. 2006); United States v. Walker, 447 F.3d 999, 1006-07
(7th Cir. 2006); United States v. Egenberger, 424 F.3d 803, 805 (Sth Cir. 2005). The First Circuit has held only that the failure to provide
notice does not constitute plain error. See United States v. Mateo, No. 06-1805, 2006 WL 1195676, at 1 (1st Cir. May 5, 2006).

tule allowing guardians or family members to exercise the right to speak on behalf of minor and incapacitated victims. For criticism of this
deletion, see supra notes 117-125 and accompanying text.
