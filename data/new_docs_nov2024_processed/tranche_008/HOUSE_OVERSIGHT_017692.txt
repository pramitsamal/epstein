2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *940

Based on this legislative history, Kenna concluded that crime victims have the right to speak at CVRA-covered proceedings.
445 Kenna explained that this interpretation advanced the purposes of the CVRA, for the statute was enacted to [*941] make
crime victims full participants in the criminal justice system.. 4° The Advisory Committee should follow that lead and
provide that victims are guaranteed a right to speak at sentencing. *47 Of course, in cases involving numerous victims (for

example, a massive fraud case), the CVRA itself allows courts to fashion a reasonable procedure” to accommodate the

competing concerns. #48

Rule 44.1 - Discretionary Appointment of Counsel for Victim The Proposals:
I proposed that the court's discretionary authority to appoimt counsel for a victim should be included in a new rule as follows:
Rule 44.1 Counsel for Victims.

When the interests of justice require, the court may appoint counsel for a victim to assist the victim in exercising his or her

rights. “49

The Advisory Committee did not propose any change in the Rules on this subject. 4°
Discussion:

The Advisory Committee never discussed this particular proposed change, so it is possible that its failure to adopt it was an
oversight. +5! In any event, here it is perhaps useful to emphasize just a few points in favor of this proposal.

While the CVRA does not create a right to counsel for victims, nothing in the Act deprived the courts of their preexisting
inherent authority. The courts generally have the right to appoint volunteer counsel in civil cases, *** a power that would seem
to extend to criminal cases. Indeed, the Supreme Court has left open the question of whether federal courts possess the inherent
authority to require counsel [*942] to provide legal services to the poor. ** The local rules of some federal courts already
explicitly recognize this power. *>4 In addition, Title 28 broadly permits the court in both civil and criminal cases to request
an attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel. 49° And before Gideon v. Wainwright, *°° courts could request

45 Td.
46 Td.

47 Tn possible response to such concerns as I raise here, the Advisory Committee modified the Advisory Committee Note to this rule. See
