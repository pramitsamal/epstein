cans would be on board. /d. Finally, the
court reasoned that the “interest of the
United States in preventing and punishing
international terrorism has been a matter
of worldwide common knowledge for
years.” Jd. (citing statutes criminalizing
terrorist acts). “It logically follows that if
federal courts may constitutionally exer-
cise criminal jurisdiction over such individ-
uals, the Constitution should be no bar to
those same federal courts, in a civil action

. exercising civil im personam jurisdic-
tion over those same individuals for the
same acts.” Id.

[44] The courts in Rein, Daltberti, and
Pugh properly exercised personal jurisdic-
tion over each of the defendants in those
cases pursuant to the FSIA, which specifi-
cally provides that personal jurisdiction ex-
ists where proper service and subject mat-
ter jurisdiction have been established. 28
U.S.C. § 1830(b); Rein, 995 F.Supp. at
329-30; Daliberti, 97 F.Supp.2d at 52;
Pugh, 290 F.Supp.2d at 58. While the
FSIA is not the basis for personal jurisdic-
tion here, jurisdiction based on the ATA or
Rule 4(k)(2) also requires minimum con-
tacts with the United States. Accordingly,
Plaintiffs may rely on their “purposefully
directed” theory to establish these mini-
mum contacts. But as existed in Burger
King, Calder, and the three terrorism
cases, Plaintiffs must allege some personal
or direct involvement by the Defendants in
the conduct giving rise to their claims.
See, eg. Daliberti, 97 F.Supp.2d at 41
(explaining that defendant Iraq had held
and tortured plaintiffs and that three of
four plaintiffs were released only after
U.S. officials’ explicit negotiations with
their Iraqi counterparts); Pugh, 290
F.Supp.2d at 56 (noting that seven individ-
ual Libyan defendants were sued in the
United States after extensive official
French investigation and that these defen-
dants were deemed to be responsible for

the bombings in both civil and criminal
proceedings); see also In re Magnetic Au-
diotape, 334 F.3d at 208 (2d (stating a
“court may exercise personal jurisdiction
over defendant consistent with due process
when defendant is primary participant in
intentional wrongdoing—albeit extraterri-
torially—expressly directed at forum”)
(citing Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. at 789-90,
104 S.Ct. 1482)); Time, Inc. v. Sumpson,
No. 02 Civ. 49170MBM), 2003 WL
23018890, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2003)
(finding Calder turned on “personal in-
volvement of the individual defendants in
the particular conduct that gave rise to the
plaintiffs claim” and granting motion to
dismiss because plaintiff had not demon-
strated that defendant had had any per-
sonal involvement in the events giving rise
to the lawsuit). Accordingly, regardless of
whether personal jurisdiction is based on
the ATA’s nationwide service of process
provision or Rule 4(k)@), to satisfy the
Fifth Amendment’s due process require-
ments, Plaintiffs must make a prima facie
showing of each Defendant’s personal or
direct participation in the conduct giving
rise to Plaintiffs’ injuries.

3. Mass Torts Theory

[45] In addition to the arguments ar-
ticulated above, the Federal Plaintiffs sub-
mit that the Court should utilize a modi-
fied due process standard appropriate for
mass torts. See, e.g., Federal Prince Turki
Opp. at 23; Federal Prince Mohammed
Opp. at 12; SAAR Network Opp. at 12-13.
Courts in the Eastern District of New
York have outlined the modified standard
in products liability cases as follows: the
state’s interests in the litigation replace
contacts with the forum as the constitu-
tional touchstone and the “reasonableness”
inquiry is replaced with a hardship analy-
