Mr. Batterjee disputes the claims
against him in a declaration filed in con-
junction with his motion to dismiss. Bat-
terjee Decl. 18. He states he was born in
Saudi Arabia, attended college in the Unit-
ed States in the 1960s, and returned to
Saudi Arabia. fd. 113, 5. He claims he
was last in the United States in June 2000
for personal reasons. Jd. 15. He denies
owning any real property, bank accounts,

tained in the complaint, Mr. Batterjee
claims BIF was never a branch of Al Bir

sent money to BIF in all ofits history. Jd.
He states he transferred away all control
of BIF in 1998. Jd. He claims he never

and denies having any knowledge of Osa-
ma bin Laden’s or al Qaeda’s activities

Mr. Batterjee also disputes the manner
in which he was served. Plaintiffs rea-

lished Osama bin Laden’s fatwas in the
past and could, therefore, reach his sup-
porters regardless of their location. Fur-
ther, The International Herald Tribune is

Mr. Arnaout and Osama bin Laden have ties.
For example, law enforcement officials in
Bosnia—Herzegovina raided BIF’s offices in
March 2002 and allegedly recovered docu-
ments establishing direct communications be-
tween Mr. Arnaout and Osama bin Laden in
the late 1980s and early 1990s. Burnett Com-
