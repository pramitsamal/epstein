Subject: Re: Possible Statement

We should be aiming at a short simple statement such as:

The events at issue occurred approximately 15 years ago when | was a teenager. Although | believed then and
continued to believe that AD was the person with whom | had sex, recent developments raise the possibility that this
may be a case of mistaken identification. 

Alternative:

that it may have been someone else.

That someone mistakenly told me it was him.

We should be able to come up with a mutually acceptable statement. It would be acceptable if the statement came from
you rather than her, if she prefers.

Have we given up on a mutually acceptable statement from VR or you. Let's keep trying. We are not THAT far apart.
