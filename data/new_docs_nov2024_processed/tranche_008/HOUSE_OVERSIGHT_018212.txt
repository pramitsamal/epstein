undermined the perceived legitimacy of the state among people who once
would work for it, including in its secret services. “People less and less see
it as a nationalist endeavor and more as a Khamenei-related project to
strengthen himself,” Javedanfar says, referring to Iran’s Supreme Leader
Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, who by some published accounts personally
authorizes all overseas attacks.

Hard-liners further aggravated the situation by purging competent
reformists from both the secret services and from Iran’s embassies —
crucial to a force expected to work undetected abroad. “Basically the Quds
Force doesn’t cooperate with the Foreign Ministry, and the Foreign
Ministry isn’t what it used to be either,” says Javedanfar. Under President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, 42% of ministry employees have only high
school degrees. “The regime is a bigger threat to itself than Israel,” he
Says.
