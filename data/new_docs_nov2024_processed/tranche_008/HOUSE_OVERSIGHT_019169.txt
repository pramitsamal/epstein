the Canopy Beach Resort in Riviera Beach. [Dobbs] was
asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would
have to provide a massage and should make $200. [Dobbs]
thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last
name) picked [Dobbs] up and she was taken to Epstein’s
house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to
Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also intro-
duced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led
upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as Jeff Epstein’s
bedroom.

Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table
with a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them
next to the massage bed. Sarah then left the room and
informed [Dobbs] Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered
the bedroom wearing only a towel.

He removed the towel and laid nude on the massage
table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a
massage oil for [Dobbs] to rub on him.

“He tried to touch me, and I stopped him,” says Dobbs.

1 asked how he tried to touch her. [Dobbs] stated that Epstein
grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable.

“Tl massage you,” Dobbs had told Epstein. “But I don’t want

to be touched.”

[Dobbs] stated she performed the massage naked. At the con-
clusion of the massage, Epstein paid [Dobbs] $200.
