' enough dirt on the girls to «a
prosecutors skeptical. Not only did
, some of the girls have issues with
drugs or alcohol but also some had
criminal records and other troubies,
Epstein’s legal team claimed. And at
least one of them, they said, fied
when she told police she was
younger than 18 when she started
performing massages for Epstein.

After the meeting, prosecutors
postponed their decision to take the
case to a grand jury.

In the following weeks, police
received complaints that two of the
victims or their families had been
harassed or threatened. Epstein’s
legal team maintains that its private
investigators did nothing illegal or
unethical during their research.

By then, relations’ between
police and prosecutors were fraying.
At a key meeting with prosecutors
and the defense, Detective Joseph
Recarey, the lead investigator, was a
no-show, according to Epstein’s
attorney.

“The embarrassment .on the
prosecutor's face was evident when,
the police officer never showed up
_for the meeting,” attorney Jack
Goldberger said.

Later in April, Recarey walked
into a prosecutor's office at the state
attorney's office and learned the
case was taking an unexpected fim.
The prosecutor, Lanna
' Belohlavek, told Recarey the state
attorney’s office had offered Epstein
a plea deal that would not require
him to serve jail time or receive a
felony conviction.

Recarey told her he disapproved
of the plea offer.

The deal never came to pass,
however.

Future unclear after charge

On May 1, the department asked
prosecutors to approve warrants to
arrest Epstein on four counts of

unlawful sexual activity with aminor -

and to charge his personal assistant,
Sarah Kellen, now 27, for her alleged
role in arranging the visits. Police
officials also wanted to: charge Rob-
son, the selfdescribed H.idi Fleiss,
with lewd and lascivious acts.

By then, the department was
frustrated with the way the state
attorney's office had handled the
case. On the same day the warrants
were requested, Palm Beach Police
. Chief Michael Reiter wrote a letter
to State Attorney Barry Krischer
suggesting he disqualify himself
from the case ifhe would not act. |

Two weeks later, Recarey was
told that prosecutors had decided |
once again to take the case to the
grand jury.

Itis not known how many of the
girls testified before the grand jury.
But Epstein’s defense team said one
girl who was subpoenaed — the one
who said she had sexual intercourse
with Epstein — never showed up.

The grand jury’s indictment was
handed down in July. It was not the

one the police department had .

wanted

charge of unlawful sexual activity
with a minor, Epstein was charged

with one count of felony solicitation -

of prostitution, which carries a
maximum penalty of five years in
prison. He was booked into the Palm ,
Beach County Jail early July 23 and |
released hours later.

Epstein’s legal team “doesn’t
dispute that he had girls over for

assages,” Goldberger said. But he
said their claims that they had sex-
ual encounters with him lack credi- |
bility.

“They are. incapable of being
believed,” he said. “They had crimi-
nal records. They had accusations of
theft made against them by their |
employers. There was evidence of |
drug use by some-ofthem.” ~

What remains for Epstein is yet
to be seen.

The Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment has asked the FBI to investi-
gate the case. It also has returned ©
the $90,000 Epstein donated in 2004.

In New York, candidates for
governor and state attorney gene:
have vowed to return a total of at
least $60,000 in campaign contribu-
tions from Epstein. Meanwhile,
Epstein’s powerful friends have.
remained silent as tabloids and
Internet blogs feast on the public
details of the police investigation. |

Goldberger maintains Epstein’s
innocence but says the legal team
has not ruled out a future plea deal.

He insists Epstein will emerge in the

end with his reputation untarnished.

“He will recover from this,” he
said. ‘
