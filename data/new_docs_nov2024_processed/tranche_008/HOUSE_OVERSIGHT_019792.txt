304 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS

popular movement has emerged questioning its purpose and meth-
ods. As a result, a legitimate debate on what should constitute our
domestic liberties—and potential limits to those when facing sig-
nificant security concerns—has largely obfuscated in this mind-set
the reality of Snowden’s weakening, durably and structurally, the
critical ability of the United States and its allies to address their
mounting external security challenges. In this culture of distrust,
whatever contradicts the innocent whistle-blower narrative can be
preemptively dismissed because Snowden, even though he remains
ensconced in Moscow at an unknown location, remains the ultimate
truth teller.

I do not accept either this formulation of Snowden or his version
of the events in which he was the hero. Opening a Pandora’s box of
government secrets is a dangerous undertaking. Whether Snowden’s
theft of state secrets proceeded from an idealistic attempt to right a
wrong, a narcissistic drive to obtain personal recognition, an intent to
weaken the foundations of the surveillance infrastructure in which
he worked, or a combination of such factors, by the time he arrived

© in Moscow, it had evolved, deliberately or not, but necessarily, into ©
a mission of disclosing key national secrets to a foreign power. In
the end, such conjectures about Snowden’s motives matter less than
that he was helped, consciously or not, by others with interests that
differed from those of the United States. The effects on America of
such a massive breach of confidence might not easily be reversible.
