THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CONUNDRUM

“Scenarios deal with two worlds: the world of facts and the world of perceptions. They explore for facts but they
aim at perceptions inside the heads of decision makers. Their purpose is to gather and transform information of
strategic significance into fresh perceptions”

—Pierre Wack, Harvard Business Review, 1985
