JAPAN

Japan would seem to be the perfect target for the Chinese party-state and its under-the-
radar efforts to turn potential adversaries into benign friends. Japan has deep cultural
and emotional ties with China, through history, language, and art, and a sense of Asian
fraternity forged by their struggles to keep intrusive, overbearing Western powers at
bay. Many in Japan also carry an enduring sense of remorse for their country’s brutal
subjugation of China in the opening half of the twentieth century. However, the

kinds of covert Chinese influence operations that have come to light in countries like
the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Europe—with one
exception—are not easy to find in Japan.

A natural place to look for evidence of influence-peddling would be in Chinese
support for the left-wing Japanese peace groups that have long investigated and
published evidence of the Imperial Army’s war atrocities in the 1930s and 1940s.
Such Japanese research has been politically useful for China in buttressing its own
efforts to chronicle the sufferings of its people during the conflict, as well as lending
support to Beijing’s tussling with Tokyo over how the history of the war should be
managed and told.
