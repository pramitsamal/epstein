Important Caveats on F2010 Medicare Liability Improvement

e Medicare Part A and Part B unfunded liability improved to -$16 trillion in F2010, up 47% from -$31 trillion in
F2009, per the Board of Medicare Trustees.

e The improvement was driven primarily by downward revisions of future cost growth assumptions following
enactment of healthcare reform in 2010.

e However, Medicare’s Chief Actuary Richard Foster noted that “while the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, as amended, makes important changes to the Medicare program and substantially improves its
financial outlook, there is a strong likelihood that certain of these changes will not be viable in the
long range...Without major changes in health care delivery systems, the prices paid by Medicare for health
services [as scheduled by current law] are very likely to fall increasingly short of the costs of providing these
services...Congress would have to intervene to prevent the withdrawal of providers from the Medicare
market and the severe problems with beneficiary access to care that would result. Overriding the productivity
adjustments, as Congress has done repeatedly in the case of physician payment rates, would lead to far
higher costs for Medicare in the long range than those projected under current law...For these
reasons, the financial projections shown [here] for Medicare do not represent a reasonable
expectation for actual program operations in either the short range (as a result of the unsustainable
reductions in physician payment rates) or the long range (because of the strong likelihood that the statutory
reductions in price updates for most categories of Medicare provider services will not be viable).”
