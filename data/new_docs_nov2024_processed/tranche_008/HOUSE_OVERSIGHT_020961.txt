The First Step to a ‘Turnaround’ is Acknowledging

There is a Problem

A turnaround situation is first recognized when there is serious concern
or dissatisfaction with the firm's [organization's] performance, results,
and/or near-term forecasts of [financial] performance and results.

- Richard Sloma, The Turnaround Manager's Handbook

If your organization is in trouble, be honest. Make it absolutely clear to
everyone in the company that survival [long-term viability] depends on
cost management.

How Might a ‘Turnaround Expert’ Look at an Organization that

Needs to be ‘Turned Around?’

The recovery of a [challenged] company [or country]...depends on the
implementation of an appropriate rescue plan or turnaround prescription.
Characteristics of the appropriate remedy are that it must: 1) address the
fundamental problems; 2) tackle the underlying causes (rather than the
symptoms) and 3) be broad and deep enough in scope to resolve all the
key issues.
