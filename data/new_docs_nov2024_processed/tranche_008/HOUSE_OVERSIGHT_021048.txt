To Take a Step Back...

e We Asked the Question

— How would public shareholders view USA Inc.?

e What Have We Found?

— USA Inc.’s finances — short-term and long-term, income statement
and balance sheet — are challenged. Management’s policies have
created incentives to invest in healthcare, housing, and current
consumption rather than in productive capital, education, and

technology — the tools needed to compete in the global marketplace.
