Q. Quinney, got that one wrong, College of Law
at the University of Utah. Is that indicating your
signature to the document?

A. That's -- that's indicating not my signature,
but it's indicating that I stand behind the arguments
made in the document, yes.

Q. Much more articulate statement than I. I
simply wanted to confirm that you had authorized your
name to be listed as a counsel who was, for purposes of

the rules, vouching for this document?

A. Yes, I was vouching for this document
completely.
Q. Okay. And you list here your address as

being at the college of law at the University of Utah
with no qualification. If you compare that to the next
exhibit, Exhibit 1 actually --

A. Yes.

Q. -- your signature has a footnote that says,
this daytime business address is provided for
identification and correspondence purposes only, and is
not intended to imply institutional endorsement by the
university of Utah; do you see that?

A. I do see that.

Q. Why was that footnote not included on the
first pleading filed which is Exhibit 2?
