A “Cascading GRAT” strategy enhances the benefits of a GRAT

e The “Cascading GRAT” strategy uses a GRAT’s annuity stream to fund subsequent
short-term GRATs
— annual reinvestment of annuity stream enhances potential value for beneficiaries

e Multiple short-term GRATs allow you to take advantage of
market volatility
— shorter terms permit market “spikes” to be captured immediately

e Short-term GRATs enable you to better manage mortality risks
— if grantor dies during term of trust, the assets in the GRAT are included in the estate
— grantor has greater probability of surviving a shorter term
