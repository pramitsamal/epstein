Healthcare Reauthorization Priorities. The Children’s
Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) will expire and needs to be
reauthorized in 2017. CHIP is a federal and state
partnership program which provides health coverage to
an estimated 8.9 millionlow-income children. In 2015,
President Obama signed the Medicare Access and CHIP
Reauthorization Act which extended CHIP for an
additional two years; without an extension of the program
in 2017 the program will exhaust its funding and states
will be required to continue the children’s coverage
through Medicaid until 2019, due to the ACA’s
maintenance of effort (MOE) provision unless the ACA is
repealed. The reauthorization process will create an
opportunity to consider additional policy changes
including changes to the CHIP and Medicaid programs.

The ACA also created a funding stream for community
health centers. In 2015, a bipartisan vote in Congress
extended the Community Health Center Fund by an
additional two years (FY 2016 and FY 2017). It is likely
that lawmakers will push to extend funding of community
health centers into future years beyond 2017.

Chronic Care. In late October, Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden along with
Senators Johnny lsakson (R-GA) and Mark Warner (D-VA),
co-chairs of the Finance Committee Chronic Care Working
Group, released a discussion draft with proposals to
improve health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries living
with chronic conditions. Potential Senate legislative
action on the discussion draft is possible in the lame duck
session, but it is also possible the bill will be taken up in
the next Congress.
