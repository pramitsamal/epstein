Why are Democrats involved in moral issues? These people should be put away until kingdom come especially
Bill Clinton if he is ever involved. They are dangerous to be around. Castrate these pedophiles ASAP. They are
so low life that if fed to the sharks, the sharks will spit them out due to their obnoxious odor.

Bill should be castrated, then Hillary would be the only one with a member.

No more Clintons or Bushes, ever again! The White House is going to have to be fumigated as it is. After the
string of disgusting excuses for human beings we’ve had for Presidents, maybe we should just raze it and
rebuild. Slick Willy and Killary should both be in prison. Instead they’re adored by their disgusting supporters.
Anyone that would support or even associate with these scum must be of the same caliber.

Don’t stop there. No more Obama’s either. And it seems there’s always a Kennedy in the wings, willing to
muddy the water.
