elephant in his living room—that is, the e/ephant in the
room. (Epstein says too it’s a reminder that elephants
have 23 copies of tumor suppressor genes and humans
have only 1.) The single book on his bedside table is
Lolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).

And, too, he seems often to be right. Since I began
working on this piece in September, Epstein predictions
about the price of oil, yen, ruble, and euro have all born
out. If I had invested $100,000 the way Epstein said I
should in early September, by the end of January I
would have made $2.4 million. (Alas, I did not invest.)

At any one moment, he is making a series of bets
for himself and others--very much not as a workaday
hedge fund, and much more as a privileged association.
Money is always about the club it gets you into.

Most everyone who is now of a certain age and
ambition and status grew up in, and found they were
temperamentally suited to, the era of wealth that started
in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids, or, as
Vanity Fair would baldly dub it, the new establishment,
an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at
further and further remove from the ordinary one.
Epstein’s is just one version.

Epstein often tells, with some obvious marvel, his
middle class to riches tale: born in 1953 in Coney
Island, father worked for the city’s Parks Department,
mother a housewife.
