Schneider says, Just bring me a size 8 tie shoe.

The salesman brings them, Schneider stuffs his feet into them, ties them tight, stands up
and winces.

When he sees how confused the salesman is, he says, Listen, I lost my business and my
house, I live with my mother-in-law, my wife is fucking my best friend, my daughter is pregnant
and my son deals crystal meth. The only pleasure I have in life is taking off these fucking

woman screaming and the smell of burning rubber.
