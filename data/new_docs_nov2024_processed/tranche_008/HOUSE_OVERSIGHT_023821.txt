Knowledge-Based Education vs.
Process-Based Education

Diagnosis is not the end, but the beginning of practice.
—Martin H. Fischer

In our society we have set up schools to teach knowledge. We concern
ourselves with what facts children know, we test to make sure they
know them, and then we complain that the schools are failing when
they don’t. This idea is so ingrained in our way of looking at school-
ing that when people like me complain about it, we are seen as people
who are rambling around muttering to ourselves.

There are so many people having anxiety attacks about what kids
know, it seems one can find an article about it in every news segment
on education.

I happened on an article in Huffington Post written by someone
named Schweitzer who is listed as “having served at the White
House during the Clinton Administration as Assistant Director for
International Affairs in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.”
Here is a piece of what he said:

The health care debate cannot be understood in historic context
because many Americans have never heard of Thomas Jefferson.
Extrapolating from state surveys, only 14% of American high
school students can name who wrote the Declaration of
Independence. Nearly 75% do not know that George Washington
was our first president. ... We can say that our educational
system has failed when the vast majority of American students
do not know enough to pass an exam to qualify as American
citizens.

This is an astonishing statement.
