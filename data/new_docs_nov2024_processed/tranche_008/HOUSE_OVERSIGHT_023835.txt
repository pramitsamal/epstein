New Curricula for a
New Way of Teaching

A smart man makes a mistake, learns from it, and never

makes that mistake again. But a wise man finds a smart man

and learns from him how to avoid the mistake altogether.
—Roy H. Williams

How do we put all this into practice? First, let’s make sure we avoid
creating departments around each of the 12 cognitive processes. The
organization around subjects, which is the basis of how our schools
are organized, is the source of the problem in both universities and
high schools.

Subjects create departments. Departments in universities are a se-
rious problem for students and administrators. They represent silos
where decisions are made that will help the department prosper. De-
partments lobby for their courses to be required so they can hire more
faculty. They make sure majors in their departments follow certain
rules for graduation that are intended to make students scholars in
their field rather than practitioners. Departments are the reason stu-
dents graduate without job skills. Faculty are almost always against
practical training. English departments have to be forced to teach stu-
dents to write. Computer science departments have to be forced to
teach students to program in a way that would make them hirable by
industry. Psychology departments avoid teaching clinical psychology,
which is really what students what to learn more about.

For about 10 years I have been building new online story-centered
curricula. The idea behind a story-centered curriculum (SCC) is that a
good curriculum should tell a story. That story should be one in which
the student plays one or more roles. Those roles should be those that
normally come up in such a story. These curricula are intended to
teach students how to actually do something. The roles students play
