attractive risk-adjusted returns. The companies that comprise the portfolio will be selected and
managed by a team of highly experienced senior partners who have developed and proven

biopharmaceutical investments with a balance of investments across other healthcare
technology sectors. Given the strength and stability of the team, the consistency and the depth
of the track record, and the positive market forces and investment conditions that are expected
