While we will continue to see solid growth from the regulated names, and a total return argument can
still be made that justifies the current premium valuation of US utilities, we do see capex growth starting
to level off. This is the opposite of what will happen in Europe and Asia, where we expect regulatory capex
to increase. Moreover, we believe US utility regulators will continue to pressure returns on equity
(ROEs) as interest rates remain low. We believe there is greater opportunity among companies with non-
regulated power generation assets, as we expect firm natural gas and thus power prices to flow through
to earnings. Note, for example, that every $1/mmbtu improvement in natural gas prices would increase
Exelon’s long-term earnings by more than 20%, whereas for pure generators such as NRG the leverage
exceeds 30%.
