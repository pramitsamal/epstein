G) Represents discretionary matching contributions under our 401(k) Plan

(i) The 2016 and 2017 amounts for Mr. Garcia is the incremental cost to Carvana of flights relating to a personal event on the private aircraft operated by
Bridgecrest Credit Company, f/k/a DT Credit Company, LLC (“Bridgecrest’’), an affiliate of DriveTime, and leased by Carvana. See “Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions — Relationship with DriveTime — Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement.” The incremental cost to Carvana
of aircraft used under the aircraft time sharing agreement for a non-business flight is calculated by multiplying the aircraft’s per-mile variable
operating cost by a flight’s total mileage, which includes the mileage of an empty return flight. Variable operating costs include: (1) landing, parking,
passenger ground transportation, crew travel, and flight planning services expenses; (2) supplies, catering, and crew traveling expenses; (3) aircraft
fuel and oil expenses; (4) maintenance, parts, and external labor (inspections and repairs); and (5) any customs, foreign permit, and similar fees. Fixed
costs that do not vary based upon usage are not included in the calculation of direct operating cost. On certain occasions, a named executive officer or
a named executive officer’s spouse or other family member may fly on the corporate aircraft as additional passengers. No additional direct operating
cost is incurred in such situations under the foregoing methodology because the costs would not be incremental. Carvana does not pay its named
executive officers any amounts in respect of taxes (so-called gross-up payments) on income imputed to them for non-business aircraft usage.

(iii) The incremental cost of the company car to us has been calculated based on the depreciation value of the vehicle.

(iv) Represents the cost of company-paid cell phone service.

(v) Mr. Garcia’s “All Other Compensation” for 2018 was less than $10,000.
