awful. By the time I'd gotten incrementally better as a cartoonist in
the first half of the 1970s | was regularly doing illustrations for soft-
core fiction stories in Cavalier's low-rent sister
mags, Dude, Gent and Nugget (even wrote a story or two there
and got several of my San Francisco comix cronies -- Spain
Rodriguez, Bill Griffith and Justin Greene) illustration gigs for

those mags as well.

[Note in Wikipedia: Maus is a graphic novel by American
cartoonist Art Spiegelman, serialized from 1980 to 1991. It
depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences
as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. The work employs
postmodernist techniques and represents Jews as mice,
Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. In 1992, Maus won a Pulitzer

Prize.]
