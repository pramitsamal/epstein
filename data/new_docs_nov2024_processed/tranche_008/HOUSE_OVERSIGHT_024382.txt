reminded student groups of “rules prohibiting the collection of
funds and the University facilities for the planning and

implementing of off-campus political and social action.”

As a result, students held a sit-in lasted till 3 a.m. Next day,
ten tables were manned again, and a campus policeman
approached one of the tables (manned by the Congress of
Racial Equality) where a dozen persons were seated. One was
singled out and placed under arrest. But before you could say
nonviolent demonstration, the police car was surrounded, its
captors reaching as many as 3,000 students. During the late
evening, bored fraternity men gathered and tossed lighted
cigarettes and eggs on those sitting in the plaza. The

demonstrators responded with silence.

Next day, 450 police assembled on campus to remove the
cop car and its arrested inhabitant, but an agreement to
negotiate was reached and the demonstrators dispersed. One of
the folk songs to come out of the Free Soeech Movement was /f
/ Negotiate With You to the tune of the Beatles’ /f/Fe// in Love
With You.

Over the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins
and attempted negotiations, and then, on December 2, the

infamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students
