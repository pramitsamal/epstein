Supplementary Education Market. For parents who continue to enroll their children in traditional public
and private schools, there is a growing demand for supplemental education services. According to the
U.S. Department of Education, 31% of elementary school children, or more than 10 million students
nationwide, are enrolled in after-school programs. According to Eduventures, the U.S. supplementary
education market was estimated to be approximately $8.1 billion in 2003. Additionally, under the No
Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, some children in poorly performing schools will be eligible for taxpayer-
financed supplemental educational services. These supplemental educational services can be provided
by state-approved non-profit or for-profit entities as well as private schools and public schools (including
public charter schools). More parents want to spend educational time with their children, but lack access
to high quality supplemental material that is effective and integrated into a comprehensive plan that is
easy for a parent to deliver and manage.

The virtual school market is a relatively new area within the broader K-12 education market. As a result,
there is a growing need for a high quality, trusted, national education offering for this demographic.
Furthermore, parents are seeking much more robust and comprehensive ongoing assessments than is
currently offered in the public schools, in order to assess their children’s progress both on a relative and
an absolute basis.

8.5. The International Education Industry

The leading authority on the worldwide education industry, the United Nations Educational Scientific and
Cultural Organization (“UNESCO”), estimates that average public expenditures on education across the
world increased from 4.1% of GNP in 1990 to 4.5% in 2000. In developing countries the increased
government focus on education is more pronounced as public education expenditures rose to 4.1% in
2000 from 3.5% in 1990. Based on global gross national income of $48 trillion, KUE estimates that the
global education market opportunity is greater than $2.4 trillion driven by the following factors:

@ Large population of school-aged children in parts of the world. The opportunity for pre-K-12 education
is particularly strong in certain countries with high fertility rates. Examples of such opportunities

include India, where mothers give birth to an average of 2.78 children. Increases in the population of
children coupled with an increased awareness of the economic and social benefits of education are
expected to lead to significant growth in the global ECE market.
