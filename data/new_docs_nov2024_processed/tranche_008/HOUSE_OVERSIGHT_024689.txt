CHAPTER Ill Cannabis Industry Segmentation

al
Cannabis Consumers Using Vaporizers

In addition to smoking and vaporizing devices, an increasing variety of other cannabis-related
accessories are available, including personal storage and transportation products. Some of these prod-
ucts focus on safety or discretion, such as childproof containers and smell-proof bags. Other products
are designed more for style, such as vaporizer pouches and tabletop storage containers intended as
decor. The market for both safety-focused accessories and style pieces is expected to grow as laws
and regulations increasingly impose requirements related to storage and transportation and as taboos
regarding cannabis use wane.
