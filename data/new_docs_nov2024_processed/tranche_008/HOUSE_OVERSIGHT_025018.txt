The masters and preachers of terror had told their foot soldiers, and
the great mass on the fence, that the Americans would make a run for
it—as they had in Lebanon and Somalia, that they didn't have the
stomach for a fight. The Arabs barely took notice when America
struck the Taliban in Kabul. What was Afghanistan to them? It was a
blighted and miserable land at a safe distance.

But the American war, and the sense of righteous violation, soon hit
the Arab world itself. Saddam Hussein may not have been the Arab
idol he was a decade earlier, but he was still a favored son of that
Arab nation, its self-appointed defender. The toppling of his regime,
some 18 months or so after 9/11, had brought the war closer to the
Arabs. The spectacle of the Iraqi despot flushed out of his spider hole
by American soldiers was a lesson to the Arabs as to the falseness and
futility of radicalism.

It is said that the east is a land given to long memory, that there the
past is never forgotten. But a decade on, the Arab world has little to
say about 9/1 1—at least not directly. In the course of that Arab
Spring, young people in Tunisia and Egypt brought down the dreaded
dictators. And in Libya, there is the thrill of liberty, delivered, in part,
by Western powers. In the slaughter-grounds of Syria, the rage is not
directed against foreign demons, but against the cruel rulers who
have robbed that population of a chance at a decent life.

America held the line in the aftermath of 9/11. It wasn't brilliant at
everything it attempted in Arab lands. But a chance was given the
Arabs to come face to face, and truly for the first time, with the
harvest of their own history. Now their world is what they make of it.
