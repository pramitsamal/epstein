Message: let me think, 1 . I would think that the world got to vote on the trump
presidency. and it votes by buying dollars . look at lira. venezuela brazil. india.
europe. the world voted and the Us is way ahead. all the worry about tariffs, trade

te are reflected in the strength of the dollar.

Message: 2. all the talk about lower tax revenues misses the point . it is about
the country's cash flow not internally generated revenue . billions of dollars
came back from europe. , and into our system it is not reflected in tax revenue
numbers. ex , if apple brings back 100 billion dollars and invests it , it does
not show in treasury tax revenue figure

Message: in addition , wage rise AFTER unemployment goes down. NOT before. !

trump first put the most disadvantaged the UNEMPLOYED first. . and with great
success. can you imagine the attacks if wages went up , but the blacks and hispanics
were still without work. He needs to be given TIME . the first play has worked.

he believes in a winning game strategy, you can't judge it because he hasn't scored a
touchdown from way in his own backfield. ( ball given to him by obama on his own 10
yard line ) he has moved the ball way up the field. and the dems can see the
touchdown coming. yes there have been some fumbles along the way, no question. and
some have been taken off the field. but the horror and the dems faces is they see the
team has progressed in spite of all the yellow flags and cries of foul. There ( sic
) defense is maxine waters and nancy pelosi ) donalds offense is pompeo mattis and
kelly. they don't have to like the quarterback they just have to win,
