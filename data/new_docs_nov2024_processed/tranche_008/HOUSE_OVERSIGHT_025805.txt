Zalikow. Arms assistance can be had elsewhere. More interesting is to supply
things that we are uniquely able to supply (intel) and use that as leverage for post
war Syria. Nuclear Iran is our primary objective. Look at all strategies in Syria
through that prism.

Perry: Going into Syria will not weaken Iran’s resolve to get nukes, but it will send
the message that the Admin is willing to act militarily. Not going into Syria will
send the opposite message and that is very dangerous.

Indyk. Don’t ditch UN. Need them for post war. Need them for Turkey. Put
pressure on Russia and then be prepared to go ahead without UN, but not yet.

Madeleine. Not going to UN for intervention does not preclude going to the UN
later.

Feavor (ex Bush). Iran is THE issue. Whatever we do in Syria cannot feel like a
quagmire. What we do in Syria will affect the recently announced ‘rebalancing to
Asia’. We cannot secure WMD without boots on the ground.

1. Iran’s reaction to fall of Assad. Look to 2007 actions agains Iran. Didn’t
have Iranian ‘pay back’ rather, Iran slowed down its nuke activity
2. Post Assad, need a peace keeping force. That will be critical. Post assad
Syria will be very, very unstable. Turks will look to stabilize their kurd
situation. Iran will adjust strategies towards Syria etc.

Ignatius We need to speak to Syrian people to let them know we are active.
Population movements towards sanctuaries (Alawite sanctuaries, Sunni

Sanctuaries etc.) will trigger atrocities.

Kahl. The fall of Assad may cause Iran to increase their nuke efforts. Do not
lose focus on Iran.

Green. Inaction will have serious negative consequences. It will be a measure of
our will to act by friends and enemies.

Israel: the big loser
