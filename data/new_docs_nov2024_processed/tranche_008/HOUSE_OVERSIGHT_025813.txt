http://jeffreyepstein.net/ - Site is live and Share This shows up when you scroll down page (look for top menu
bar)

I expect this to rank swiftly - I'm sending a list of all properties we need to point over in this direction with
suggested anchor text.

Do you have the topic right I'm doing a placement around? I'm going to have a few articles spun-off from it
and put into lower tier publications as well.

I want to push HARD in August with a premium placement, fresh link pushes, and some supporting
placements. We should be able to get down to 1 negative by mid-September with a goal of being clean by end
of year (unless new negative press comes again...)

For social media updates... Are you currently doing these? I'd like to look at how often we are doing them and
trying to link to our own content more often.

I'm also exploring if we can get this new site included in Google News and maybe syndicate other important
AI news through it... would give us free google news spots when we need them..

JE - There's 3 negatives today and that's 3 too many. There will be progress please continue to be patient as
you have been.

Best

Tyler
