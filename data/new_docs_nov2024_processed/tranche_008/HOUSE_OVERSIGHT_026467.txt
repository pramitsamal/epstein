Empowering women in the age of Trump is an essential part of moving this country
forward. But that means moving forward on issues that have long been stalled -

In 2018, we have the chance to move these issues forward, and |'m asking for your
help in making it happen.

the March Alive! Chip in $5 Today.

Now we need to bring it to Tallahassee.

Sincerely,
Philip
