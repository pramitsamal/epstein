Many Iran watchers assert that to persuade Tehran not to pursue a nuclear weapon,
Washington must reassure Khamenei that the United States merely seeks a change in

Iranian behavior, not a change of the Iranian regime.

What they fail to consider is Khamenei's deep-seated conviction that U.S. designs to
overthrow the Islamic Republic hinge not on military invasion but on cultural and political
subversion intended to foment a velvet revolution from within. Consider this revealing

address on Iranian state TV in 2005:

More than Iran's enemies need artillery, guns, and so forth, they need to spread cultural
values that lead to moral corruption.... I recently read in the news that a senior official in
an important American political center said: Instead of bombs, send them miniskirts.” He
is right. If they arouse sexual desires in any given country, if they spread unrestrained
mixing of men and women, and if they lead youth to behavior to which they are naturally
inclined by instincts, there will no longer be any need for artillery and guns against that

nation.

Khamenei's vast collection of writings and speeches makes clear that the weapons of mass
destruction he fears most are cultural -- more Kim Kardashian and Lady Gaga than bunker
busters and aircraft carriers. In other words, Tehran is threatened not only by what
America does, but by what America is: a depraved, postmodern colonial power bent on
achieving global cultural hegemony. America's strategic policy,” Khamenei has said, is

seeking female promiscuity.”

Khamenei's words capture the paradox and perversion of modern Iran. While dropping
bombs on the Iranian regime could likely prolong its shelf-life, a regime that sees women's

hair as an existential threat is already well past its sell-by date.
