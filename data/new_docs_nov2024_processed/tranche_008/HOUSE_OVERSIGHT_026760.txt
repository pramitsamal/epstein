There has been some looting and other lawlessness in some areas. Local law enforcement is now
supported by resources from our federal and state governments. Our on-site team reports that we have
been spared that threat. In addition to our own Loss Prevention staff, our Management Company has
hired an independent security team to help protect our property.

One of the most important questions we must address is just when our Club might open again. The
Club is closed through October 7 and Member Services is not presently taking any reservations through
December 17. There is a strong possibility that our re-start date could hinge on when the rest of St.
Thomas recovers, and it is simply impossible to predict that date at this time. Your Board and the
Management team are monitoring this closely and we will keep you apprised.

And finally, we thank all who have contributed to the GBCOA Employee Relief Fund. Our Ladies

and Gentlemen are in desperate need of your help. They deeply appreciate whatever you may offer to
help, as does the Board. Thank you!
