DP: The U.S. has been the patron for democracy for a century, since
Wilson’s 14 Points, and a wonderful heritage it has been. When an
American travels the world, he finds himself in country after country
where his country played a monumentally positive role, especially in
democratizing the system. We naturally want to extend this to Muslim-
majority countries. Sadly, these for some time have offered an unpleasant
choice between brutal and greedy dictators or ideological, extreme, and
antagonistic elected Islamists. It’s not a choice we should accept.

TB: So what should we do?

DP: I offer three simple guidelines. One, always oppose the Islamists. Like
fascists and Communists, they are the totalitarian enemy, whether they
wear long beards in Pakistan or suits in Washington.

Two, always support the liberal, modern, secular people who share our
worldview. They look to us for moral and other sustenance; we should be
true to them. They are not that strong, and cannot take power soon
anywhere, but they represent hope, offering the Muslim world’s only
prospect of escape from the dreary dichotomy of dictatorship or
extremism.

Three, and more difficult, cooperate with dictators but condition it on
pushing them toward reform and opening up. We need the Mubaraks of
the world and they need us. Fine, but relentlessly keep the pressure on
them to improve their rule. Had we begun this process with Abdullah
Saleh of Yemen in 1978 or with Mubarak in 1981, things could have been
very different by 2011. But we didn’t.

TB: Egypt might be the test case.

DP: Well, it’s a bit late. Mohammed Mors! 1s not a greedy dictator but he
emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood, and his efforts since reaching
power have been purely Islamist.

TB: What about the recent elections?

DP: I do not believe that a single one of the elections and referenda in
Egypt was fairly conducted. It surprises me that Western governments and
media are so gullible on this score.
