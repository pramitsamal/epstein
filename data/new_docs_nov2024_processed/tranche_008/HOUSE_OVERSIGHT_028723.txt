T think Qatar is going by the ground
reality, says Bokhari. Fatah, the ruling
faction of the PA, is essentially tanking. It's
really in a state of decline because of
corruption and charges of embezzlement.
It's got an aging leadership. There's no
dynamism left in the group. There's a lot of
factionalism. It's almost like an oligarchy.

Rawabi could be Qatar's way of
encouraging the currently-calm status quo
in the West Bank, but without obviously
upgrading their ties to Israel, or throwing
their money behind a political
establishment that they don't fully trust.
On one end they need to make sure Fatah
does not completely collapse or weaken to
the point where they're no longer coherent,
says Bokhari, and Hamas needs to be
shaped and contained and shepherded in a
way that it doesn't grow into anything
larger.

Though there are politics underlying
Qatar's investment in Rawabi, it is still,
inevitably, a financial decision. You have
serious people who have a lot at risk here,
Danin says. Their goal is not primarily to
make a political point. Their goal is to
recoup their investment and make some
money. Even resource-rich Qatar, which
wants to diversity its holdings in order to
hedge against long-term shifts in the oil
and natural gas market, cares whether its
investment choices pay off.
