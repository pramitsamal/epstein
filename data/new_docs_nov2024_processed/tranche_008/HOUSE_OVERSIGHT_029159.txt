] FEEL CERTAIN I HAVE HAD FAR MORE EXPERIENCE WITH PSYCHIATRISTS THAN
PETER HAS. AMI A “LAY PERSON”? WHO KNOWS? IF ALL NON-PSYCHIATRISTS
ARE LAY PEOPLE THEN PSYCHIATRISTS ARE MERELY PUFFING THEMSELVES UP
AND ROPING THEMSELVES OFF, SOMETHING THEY HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE THE
TIME OF FREUD.

NOT REALLY—THIS IS A FAMOUS JOKE OF EINSTEIN’S BUT, HEY, WHO’SE
COUNTING?

TRUMP AS AN ORGANISM—AS SEEN BY A “LAY PERSON”

STRONGLY BIASED TOWARD CLOSE FAMILY
STRONGLY BIASED AGAINST DISTANT RELATIVES—A RACIST OF THE
FIRST RANK

EXTREME NARCISSIST

A STRATEGY OF RANDOM MOVES—TO FOOL OTHERS? AND/OR KEEP
ATTENTION PERPETUALLY FOCUSED ON HIM?—INCREDIBLE HOW HE WILL
GO AGAINST THE NRA ONE DAY AND INVITE IN THEIR LEADERS THE
FOLLOWING DAY

LYING CONTINUOUSLY--VERY CREATIVE AND OBSTINATE—PRODUCING
AN ENTIRE ALTERNATE UNIVERSE, PERMITTING HIM TO REVERSE COURSE
AND COVER TRACKS AT THE SAME TIME

Minor matters:

Peter points out that Mealy (1995) was the first reference he knows of on
psychopathy being under frequency dependent selection. An earlier paper, cited in
the one | attached, developed the same argument—Harpending and Sobus 1987.

Peter characterizes sickle cell anemia as a “crude adaptation to malaria”. Crude? In
what sense?

A single copy of the sickle gene gives you anemia, in which the normal shape of the
red blood cell—a flat round pill—changes under low oxygen tension into a sickle
shape which crushes the malarial Plasmodium inside it. The low oxygen tension is
caused by the parasite itself, since it consumes oxygen in the red blood cell. The cell
then quickly flips back into normal shape as the oxygen tension returns to normal
levels. A sickle individual without malaria suffers no cost at all, since all red blood
cells have oxygen tension well above the level that would cause sickling.
