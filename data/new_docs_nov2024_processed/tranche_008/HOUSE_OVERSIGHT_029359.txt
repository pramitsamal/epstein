The 1* lesson: Be modest in
prophecy. In particular, when it comes
to the future. Mubarak for example had
about 400,000 people at his disposal
working in various security agencies in
order to preemptively predict events
such as those that took place at Tahrir
Square. And he did not foresee the
uprising. So who can?

The 2 lesson: When friends, and even
the leaders among us, say: Don't get
swept into a panic — 1f something really
grave happens (Iran for example) — the
US will not stand by. The world will
take action!

And I say: Don't bet on it. Look at Syria.
Assad has massacred 200,000 of his own
people — with tanks, artillery, fighter
jets, even chemical weapons — and the

world did not lift a finger.
