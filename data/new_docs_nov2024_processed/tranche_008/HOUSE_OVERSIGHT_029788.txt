FP: 2013 is the 20th anniversary of the
Oslo negotiations. What was Oslo's
greatest success, and its greatest failure?

SE: The fact that, two decades after Oslo,
we are still a nation under occupation
shows that Israeli governments did derail
it. The interim accords were not supposed
to last for 20 years but only five. After
that, we were going to enjoy freedom and
sovereignty.

But Israel increased its settlement
expansion. In fact, within 20 years, the
number of settlers almost tripled. The
institution-building efforts led by the
Palestinian government have been
completely undermined by the lack of
freedom. This situation cannot continue.
Oslo succeeded in bringing back 250,000
Palestinians from the diaspora and
building the capacity for our state. The
international community failed though,
by granting Israel an unprecedented
culture of impunity that allowed them to
use negotiations as a means to continue
rather than stop colonization.

FP: What is the most important

thing Israelis don't understand about
Palestinians?

SE: That we are not going anywhere. As
simple as that. We are not going to
disappear just because their government
builds an annexation wall around us.
