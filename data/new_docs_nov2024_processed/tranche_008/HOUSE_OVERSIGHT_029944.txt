Whereas the defunct two state solution was proposed in 1947, when
the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 181 calling for dividing
historic Palestine into two entities and for granting Jerusalem an
international status, the reversal of this resolution by the Assembly is
imperative. Although not legally binding, this resolution did grant
legitimacy to the creation of the State of Israel. Ironically, since that
resolution, there was no serious discussion concerning the
establishment of two states in Palestine until the 1991 Madrid
Conference and the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of
Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements) in Washington
in 1993. Except for a few euphoric, but short-lived moments, not the
slightest progress has been made towards granting the Palestinians
statehood, and all attempts to establish two states have failed.

We propose that neutral member states should ask the UN General
Assembly to rescind Resolution 181 and to request a new resolution
for the establishment of one state in historic Palestine. Although this
responsibility falls under the Security Council, the constant exercise
by the US of its veto power to protect Israel against condemnations
and sanctions has proven the council's ineffectiveness in dealing
objectively with the Arab-Israeli conflict.

At the General Assembly, each state has an equal voting right, thus
lending legitimacy to passed resolutions. In its deliberations, the
Assembly should also address international law and human rights
violations committed by Israel, the PA, and neighbouring states
against the Palestinian people, and set a course for a new beginning
in the Middle East through major shifts in the paradigms that have
crippled the region for decades.

A resolution for establishing one democratic state in historic
Palestine will include as citizens all those who live there and all
Palestinians in the Diaspora, reaffirming Palestinian refugees right to
return, and acknowledging the special place that Palestine is for
