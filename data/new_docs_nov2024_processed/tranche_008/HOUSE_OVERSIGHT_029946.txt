relinquishes occupied Lebanese and Syrian territories and dismantles
it nuclear arsenal; cultural, political, and economic development of
the region; and equal rights of all people living on that land.

The new state will be diverse -- an amalgam of different nationalities
and faiths, all with equal rights and opportunities. To the Abrahamic
faiths, historic Palestine is the Holy Land. The majority of the
Palestinians see themselves as Arabs; as such, the new state should
have a special status in a more meaningful Arab League. The
nationalistic feelings of the Jewish population that link them to fellow
Jews worldwide must be recognised and upheld. The Jewish
population will, however, have to reject Zionism, a racist and
apartheid ideology based on 19th century European colonialist
thinking which preyed on the Jewish national feelings long before the
Palestinians became its victims.

The new state will bring fundamental changes in governance to the
region. Democracy based on equal opportunities will begin to take
hold with economic and military unions of the independent states of
the region. An EU-like union of the new state, Syria, Jordan and
Lebanon will enhance peace and reconciliation and will be a nucleus
for a larger regional union.

There are numerous challenges ahead. They range from developing
trust to rebuilding the infrastructure, the judicial, educational and
social institutions; from disposing of the nuclear arsenal to dealing
with the issues of confiscated lands, demolished homes and erased
towns and villages. The first step, however, is to go to the UN
General Assembly.
