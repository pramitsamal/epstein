Hi Marty,

Hope all is well. Noticed this Guardian story about Michael Wolff's new book, which states Donald Trump
purchased a Palm Beach property Mr. Epstein had planned to buy, behind Mr. Epstein's back. And that Mr.
Epstein threatened to expose Trump's shady real estate deals. Do you know anything about this? Does Mr.
Epstein have any knowledge of illegal or suspicious dealings by President Trump?

Also, we plan on running a story this Friday about the Crime Victims' Rights Act suit, and the Jane Does'
proposed remedies. The alleged victims want the U.S. Attorney's Office to rescind the immunity provisions in
the NPA, and to pursue a prosecution against Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators. Can you comment on this?

Thanks so much!

Kate
