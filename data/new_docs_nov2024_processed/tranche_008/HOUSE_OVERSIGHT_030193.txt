woven into his performances. But as clubs became increasingly afraid to
hire him, he devoted more and more time and energy to the law.

In less than two years, Lenny was arrested 15 times. Club owners
were afraid to book him. He couldn’ t get a gig in six months. On a
Christmas day, he was alone in his hotel room, and | brought him a $500
bill. With a large safety pin, he attached it to his denim jacket. When he
finally got a booking in Monterey, he admitted, “I feel like it's taking me
away from my work.”

Lenny lived way up in the hills. His house was protected by barbed
wire and a concrete gate, except that it was always open. He had a wall-to-
wall one-way mirror in his living room, but when the sun was shining you
could see into the room instead of out. He was occasionally hassled by
police on his own property. One evening in October 1963, we were talking
while he was shaving, when four officers suddenly appeared, loud and
obnoxious. He asked them to leave unless they had a search warrant.

One of the cops took out his gun. “Here's my search warrant,” he
said. Then Lenny and the cops had a discussion about the law, such as the
rules of evidence, and after half an hour they left. Lenny tried to take it all
in stride, but the encounter was depressing, and he changed his mind

about going out that night.
