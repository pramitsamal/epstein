We should think about a letter to the editor today. ‘School’ can mean university. Age of
consent in Florida is complex — see below:

If you are 16-yrs-old, a sexual relationship with someone 18-24is legal in Florida. The two persons
involved must be between 16 and 24.
Florida Statute 794.05

(1) A person 24 years of age or older who engages in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17
years of age commits a felony of the second degree.

So as soon as you turn 16 you are able to have sexual relations. And you can have sexual relations
with a minor (under 18) until your 24th birthday.

In one left for her or ‘Sarah’, a caller says she ‘doesn’t know at what time she must come this night
for the massage’.

Other messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, contain such phrases as: ‘She has
females for Mr JE’ and ‘I have a female for him’.

Another with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: “He just did a
