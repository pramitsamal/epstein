defence. The witness must be advised of this requirement.

*Payment to criminals

i) Payment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information,
which seek to exploit a particular crime or to glorify or glamorise
crime in general, must not be made directly or via agents to convicted
or confessed criminals or to their associates — who may include
family, friends and colleagues.

ii) Editors invoking the public interest to justify payment or offers
would need to demonstrate that there was good reason to believe the
public interest would be served. If, despite payment, no public
interest emerged, then the material should not be published.

Actually school means university in the states. I think probably best not to get into the legality or not of sexual activity of young
people and nor is it relevant to JE case as he was in his late 40’s at the time of this story..the headline is deliberately wrong..school adults
would have been accurate..

We should think about a letter to the editor today. ‘School’ can mean university. Age of consent in Florida is complex — see
below:

Ifyou are 16-yrs-old, a sexual relationship with someone 18-24is legal in Florida. The two persons involved must be between 16
and 24.

Florida Statute 794.05

(1) A person 24 years of age or older who engages in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17 years of age commits a felony of the
second degree.
