Since his arrival in the U.S., Guo has publicly detailed allegations of corruption in the
Chinese ruling party.

The Times reported that Broidy drafted a plan to enlist Emirati officials to pressure the U.S.
to turn over Guo. In his statement to the newspaper, Broidy said he “never had a strategy or
plan regarding Mr. Guo nor was there any compensation given or even discussed.”

Broidy’s alleged efforts to push for Guo’s extradition came after Wynn separately helped
deliver a message from the Xi government seeking to have the dissident returned to China,
according to a person familiar with the effort.

Wynn, who has contacts with Chinese officials because of his business interests in Macau,
hand-delivered a letter to Trump seeking Guo’s deportation, The Journal reported last year.
A spokesman for Wynn Resorts has said that the report about Wynn’s role was false.

At the time, the president expressed interest in assisting the Chinese, but was met with
resistance by senior law enforcement officials, according to the person.

White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.
