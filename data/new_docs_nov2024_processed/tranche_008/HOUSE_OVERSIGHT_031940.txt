Palestinians; and 20,000 Islamists killed in 1982 by the elder al-
Assad in Hama. The World Health Organization’s estimate of Osama
bin Laden’s carnage in Iraq was already 150,000 a few years earlier.
In a 2007 research, Gunnar Heinsohn from the University of Bremen
and Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, found out that
some 11 million Muslims have been violently killed since 1948, of
which 35,000, (0.3 percent) died during the six years of Arab war
against Israel, or one out of every 315 fatalities. In contrast, over 90
percent who perished were killed by fellow Muslims. According to
Mssrs. Heinsohn and Pipes, the grisly inventory finds the total
number of deaths in conflicts all over the world since 1950
numbering around 85 million. Of that, the Muslim Arab deaths in the
Arab-Israeli conflict were at 46,000 including 11,000 during Israel’s
war of independence. That makes 0.05 percent of all deaths in all
conflicts, or 0.4 percent of all Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
In another calculation ignoring “small” massacres like the one that
goes on in Syria and other deaths during the Arab Spring, only
Saddam’s Iraq, Jordan, the elder al-Assad’s Syria, Iran-Iraq war, the
bin Laden campaign in Iraq, the Iranian Islamic revolution and the
Turkish-Kurdish conflict caused 1.65 million Muslim deaths by
Muslims compared to less than 50,000 deaths in the Arab-Israeli
conflict since 1950, including fatalities during and after Operation
Cast Lead which came after the Heinsohn-Pipes study. For those who
don’t have a calculator ready at their desks, allow me to tell: 50,000
is three percent of 1.65 million. Golda Meir, the fourth prime
minister of Israel, or rather the “Mother of Israel,” had a perfectly
realistic point when she said that peace in the Middle East would
only be possible “when Arabs love their children more than they hate
