Advisors: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon.

On the issues:

Afghanistan/Pakistan: We have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat,
Obama announced last June, noting that the 33,000 surge troops he
sent to Afghanistan in 2009 would be out of the country by the
summer of 2012. Although a constant barrage of drone strikes and
special operations raids have taken a harsh toll on al Qaeda, it may be
difficult for Obama to make the case that Afghanistan has achieved
stability or that Hamid Karzai's government can stand on its own
without U.S. assistance.

Relations with Pakistan have deteriorated significantly under
Obama's tenure, particularly following the bin Laden raid. He has
pledged to constantly evaluate the relationship between the two
countries going forward but says he would be hesitant to cut off aid
that could help the Pakistani people strengthen their own society and
their own government.

Military spending: Backed by his then current defense secretary,
Robert Gates, Obama announced last April that the Pentagon will
lead a fundamental review of U.S. military capabilities in order to
cut $400 billion in defense spending over the next 10 years. We
need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and
effectiveness, but conduct a fundamental review of America's
missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world, Obama
said. Of course, major cuts could come sooner than that if the
congressional supercommittee fails to reach an agreement on deficit
reduction by Nov. 23.
