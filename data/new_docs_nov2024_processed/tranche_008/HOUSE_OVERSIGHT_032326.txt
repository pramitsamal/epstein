Hi Jeffrey,

Just wondered if you have time to discuss the business plan of InsightsPod on Skype or if you prefer I can
meet you in person after 19th Oct.

Regards,
Zubair

Hi Jeffrey,
Please find attached InsightsPod business plan for your consideration.

Since Twitter is live streaming the presidential debates, the social media activity will accelerate and it
will help us in making better predictions of outcome. It was apparent from the US Election report, which
I sent you previously that we need a Data Scientist who can translate our data into better insights. Taking
this into account I hope you can help us by backing this venture.

Thanks,
Zubair
