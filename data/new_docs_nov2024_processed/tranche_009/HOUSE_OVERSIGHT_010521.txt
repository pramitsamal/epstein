gotten into more fights there, growing depressed and withdrawn
from her sister and parents. Helplessly, her parents watched her
spiral out of control. As they neared the end of their rope, they
sent her out of state. But after the move, Mary had fallen apart
completely. She used drugs, fell in with a bad crowd, ran away
from her relatives, and shacked up with a gang of drug dealers.

When the gang was busted by local police, the dealers blamed
Mary for snitching and put out the word that they wanted her
dead.

“We had to move her again,” Mary’s father explained. “We
finally got her into therapy — she’s still seeing the therapist. And
worst of all, she developed HPV. She’s already had to have a seri-
ous operation.”

Mary’s troubles didn't end there. On June 28, she was brought
in front of the grand jury. She hadn't been briefed by the state
attorney —she hadn't even met the prosecutors —and she had
no idea what she would be asked.

Almost immediately, she found that she was being treated

“The prosecutor produced a printout of our daughter's
Myspace page,” Mary's father recalls. “Mary was stunned. She
began to cry. The prosecutor accused her of all sort of things; it

was like she was working for Epstein.

“All this time, we knew that we were being watched. Creepy 4

guys. Private investigators from Miami. They would follow us, 4
scaring the hell out of my wife and Mary’s sister. My car was vane a

dalized. It was like living in hell.”

By this point, Epstein’s defense dream team included Jack 4
Goldberger, Alan Dershowitz, and Gerald Lefcourt. All of them ;
had excellent track records. Dershowitz and Lefcourt were tWO
