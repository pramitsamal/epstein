including masturbation and touching the girl’s vagina.

Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Jane Doe
was recruited to give Epstein a massage for monetary com-
pensation. Jane was brought to Epstein’s mansion in Palm
Beach. Once at the mansion, Jane was introduced to Sarah
Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room with the
massage table. In this room, Epstein told Jane to take off her
clothes and give him a massage. Jane kept her panties and
bra on and complied with Epstein’s instructions. Epstein
wore only a towel around his waste [sic]. After a short period
of time, Epstein removed the towel and rolled over exposing
his penis. Epstein began to masturbate and he sexually
assaulted Jane.

- After Epstein had completed the assault, Jane was then
able to get dressed, leave the room and go back down the
stairs. Jane was paid $200 by Epstein. The young girl who
recruited Jane was paid $100 by Epstein for bringing Jane to
him.

As a result of this encounter with Epstein, Jane experi-
enced confusion, shame, humiliation and embarrassment, and

has suffered severe psychological and emotional injuries.
