A. Right.

Q. That because he visited, according to
Mr. Rodriguez, several times a year in 2004, 2005, he
must have visited several times a year in 2000 -- 19- --
middle of 1999 to the middle of 2002.

A. Ididn't say must have. I said that that's
going to be evidence of the common scheme and plan, and
then, in the absence of, you know, some falling out
between people or somebody becoming, you know, more
associated or less associated with a criminal
organization. I mean, if you want to get into the
circumstantial evidence, in 2003, there's an article on
which, you know, Dershowitz identifies himself --

Q. Let me interrupt you because I'm asking --

A. Okay.

QQ. -- about -- my only question is evidence of
how -- not anything, whether engaged in conduct or
didn't engage in conduct, just how many times he came
during this period.

A. Right.

MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, counsel. That's the
reason why I asked you to clarify whether you
want to limit this to direct evidence or whether
you want all of the evidence including
circumstantial evidence, because as we both know,

circumstantial evidence is good evidence. A
well-connected chain of circumstance can be --

MR. SIMPSON:

as compelling proof as direct evidence of a given
fact. That's the law.

MR. SIMPSON: Really, sir.
MR. SCAROLA: -- the circumstantial
evidence --
MR. SIMPSON: Mr. Scarola --
MR. SCAROLA: -- tell us that.
MR. SIMPSON: -- please don’t make speeches,

and please don't coach the witness.

MR. SCAROLA: Just tell us that. I'm not
coaching the witness. I'm asking you -- you're
asking ambiguous questions.

MR. SIMPSON: There's nothing ambiquous --

MR. SCAROLA: If you want only direct
evidence, we will give you only direct evidence.

If you want a full and complete answer, it's
got to include circumstantial evidence, so don't
cut him off when he's giving you that.

MR. SIMPSON: Really, objecting to the form
of the question preserves all of any problems
there may be with the question.

MR. SCAROLA: No, sir.

MR. SIMPSON: We don't need a speech.

MR. SCAROLA: It doesn't. It doesn’t.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Mr. Cassell, is it your testimony that, from
Mr. Rodriguez's testimony about how often he says
Professor Dershowitz visited in a 2004/2005 time frame,
it's fair to draw an inference about how often he
visited in an earlier -- three-year earlier time frame?

A. In the circumstances of this case,
absolutely.

Q. And would it be fair to infer from the number
of times that Donald Trump visited three years later,
how often he visited at an earlier period?

A. I did not investigate the circumstances
involving Trump. He wasn't somebody that was coming up.

Q. Were you aware on December 30th of 2014 that
Donald Trump was quoted in Vanity Fair as saying: I've
known Jeff -- referring to Epstein -- oh, I'm sorry.

It was a New Yorker Magazine, not Vanity Fair, That he
was quoted as saying: I've known Jeff -~ referring to
Epstein -- for 15 years. Terrific quy. And he's a fot

of fun to be with.” It even said that: He likes
beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on
the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys the
social ~~ social life? Were you aware of that on
December 30th, 2014?

A. Possibly. I mean that sounds vaguely
familiar. Trump has just not been somebody that -- that
I’ve paid much attention to in this case.

Q. Based on that statement, and the facts we
discussed earlier about Mr. Trump visiting and being a
friend, and the other circumstances we discussed, are
you suspicious about whether he engaged in sexual
misconduct with minors?

MS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to the
extent that you can't reveal anything that my
client has informed you of,

THE WITNESS: Right. If we set aside that
information, I'm not -- I'm not suspicious, no,
not given the information I have.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Okay. So notwithstanding that his name is
circled in the address book, he was a good friend, he
visited often, and he was quoted as saying that Jeff was
a terrific guy who liked young women almost as much as
Trump did, you're not even suspicious?
