believe, please provide me with any such reason.
Iam certain I can demonstrate to you that it is
false.
Is that consistent with your recollection of
the response?

A. That sounds about right, yeah.

Q. So Mr. Dershowitz did not ignore the letter;
he responded to it, correct?

A. I think that's right.

Q. And go back to the first letter.

A. But, now, if we are -- if we're talking
about -- yeah, there's that one letter and now there's a
response letter, right.

Q. My question to you is: Does the statement to
@ person that we have reason to believe that you have
personally observed another person in the presence of
underage females and we would like to ask you about your
observations,” put the recipient on notice that you,
yourself, are accused of criminal conduct in abusing
minors?

A. Well, it puts you on notice that you're a
potential, obviously, witness to this and then therefore
you could have potential involvement.

Let me give you a simple iHustration. It'll
take about 20 seconds. If somebody says --

Q. Well, let me back up. My first question,
though, if you can answer the question.

MR. SCAROLA: No. I'm sorry. The witness is
entitled to complete his response. If you
don't -- if you believe it to be unresponsive,
you can move to strike it, but he’s entitled to
complete it.

MR. SIMPSON: He --

MR. SCAROLA: So go ahead and complete your
response.

MR. SIMPSON: Can we have a -- you can give
an explanation, but a yes or no with an
explanation.

MR, SCAROLA: You already got that. Could we
now have the completion of the response?

THE WITNESS: Here's the simple illustration
I think makes it pretty clear: If somebody says,
we have observed you in the presence of a kilo of
cocaine, we would like to question you about the
presence -- about your observations of this, that
doesn't directly state that you are a drug user
or a drug dealer, but it certainly puts you on
notice that you're associated with that criminal
activity and somebody is going to question you
about it.

In the context of this case, to say, you have

been observed in the -- in -- by numerous
witnesses in the presence of a convicted sex
offender and underage girls, and we would like to
talk to you about those observations, I think
that puts you on notice that you're in -- in --

in jeopardy of -- of criminal activity,

particularly when you combine that with the fact
that there is a duty to report child abuse in

many states in this country, including the State
of Florida.

And so that if those observations were such
that they would give rise to a reasonable
inference that sex abuse was -- of children was
going on and you'd be obligated to report it, as
I think Mr. Dershowitz conceded yesterday, yes,
you -- I think that puts you on notice that --
that those kinds of things are being alleged.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. So, first, the letter itself, the letter from
Mr. Scarola simply says, you were -- you were personally
-- you personally observed Jeffrey Epstein in the
presence of underaged females, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. It does not say, you witnessed abuse of any

minor; we have reason to believe you observed abuse of
minors?

A. If those words do not appear there, but come
on, we -- we know -- we know in the context of this
case, when somebody is asking to take a deposition about
your observation of young girls, they weren't talking
about preparations for birthday parties. They were
talking about sexual abuse of children.

And that was what Mr. Dershowitz was going to
be asked about. And he did not -- he did not take that
opportunity to try to clear the record; Instead, we are,
you know, here today, because among other reasons, he --
he -- he wasn't deposed then.

Q. I want -- I want to comment. I'm just a
little bit non -- nonplussed, so I want to come back to
this again.

A. Well, I'm -- I have to tell you, I'm a little
bit nonplussed that somebody would say that letter
doesn't put you on notice that you're potentially
involved in criminal activity. I mean, come on.

Q. 1 -- my question wasn't potentially involved
in criminal activity. We disagree about whether it does
that.

A. Okay. I think it does.

Q. I suspect you -- that's how you read it?
