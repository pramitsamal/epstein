(4.5) shows something about “balance” or the state where capital, consumption and
output grow at the same rate. It confirms the standard teaching that balance is
possible, although not compelled, when growth rate is constant. It also shows that
balance is impossible when growth rate changes. No one disputes that capital
productivity (output/capital) always leads, and consumption rate
(consumption/capital) always lags, in accelerations up and down. Output gets the
bad news first and the good news first. What the equations leave unspecified is
where capital itself joins the sequence. That is what the evidence in the charts and

tables tells us.

In the case where the free growth index equals one, for example, the above

equations show

thrift gain

thrift index = —=0, implying
acceleration
— change in consumption rate
thrift gain = change in growth rate =0, and

change in consumption rate =0, or equivalently

consumption
consumption rate = oo = constant, (4.7)
capita

if acceleration is non-zero. (The reason for that qualifier is that zero acceleration

means zero change in growth rate, and division by zero is a no-no.)

In the opposite case where the thrift index is one, the same equations would show

free exerts idles = productivity gain _ changeinproductivtyrate _
acceleration change in growth rate
