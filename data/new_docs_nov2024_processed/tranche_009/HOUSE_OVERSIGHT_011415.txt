transcript in front of her and she doesn't look at it. She

doesn't even look at the transcript. She doesn't turn the

page. She doesn't read any of it. There's a question asked at

some point later: Isn't it true that everything you said in

the police department was true? And then shortly after that,

the deposition ends. And they're trying to say that that is a
sufficient factual basis and an evidentiary basis for the
admission of this transcript, which is, you know, unsponsored
hearsay.

There's a similar problem with this recording because

Ms. Hall never listened to the recording, never authenticated
