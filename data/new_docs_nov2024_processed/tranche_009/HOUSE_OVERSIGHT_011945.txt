Lawsuit documents link Jeffrey Epstein to
modeling agency owner Jean Luc Brunel

New court filings in a civil case filed by billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein link Epstein and
Jean Luc Brunel, owner of modeling agency MC2.

The documents say MC2 employees told attorney Brad Edwards that Epstein’s condos at 301 E.
66th St. in New York City were used to house young models.

Edwards, who has sued Epstein on behalf of several women claiming to be victims of sex abuse
by Epstein, was told MC2 brought underage girls in from all over the world, promising them
modeling contracts,

“Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a visa for these girls, then would charge the underage
girls rent,” the documents say.

Through the investigation of his lawsuits against Epstein, Edwards learned Brunel “runs the
modeling agency MC2, a company for which Epstein provides financial support,” the documents
say.

They also allege Epstein tried to thwart Edwards from taking depositions of Brunel, Epstein’s
companion Guislaine Maxwell, and other high-profile names such as President Bill Clinton.

Details are listed in more than 62 pages filed by attorney Jack Scarola on behalf of Edwards in
the lawsuit Epstein filed against Edwards. Edwards represents four of Epstein’s minor victims,

three of whom have settled their cases with Epstein under a confidential agreement.

Epstein attorneys Christopher Knight and Joseph Ackerman declined to comment Friday on the
court filings.

Edwards deposed Brunel, but his attorney delayed it and then said he was back in France with no
plans to return. But according to the court papers, Brunel was staying with Epstein in Palm
Beach during that period.
