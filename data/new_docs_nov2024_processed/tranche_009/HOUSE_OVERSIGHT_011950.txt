That Gorgeous Underage Model May Be A
Slave: Regulation For Agencies To Stop Child
Sex Trafficking

First came the knowledge that slaves still existed and were present in larger numbers than ever
before. Then the realization that a human being could be purchased within a few hours of my
home for under $100. Now only a few miles away. In the following years I've been learning the
myriad forms, places and types of slavery. The list keeps lengthening and with each new form
(to me), I learn about , it knocks me down, one more time.

Slavery

Debt Bondage
Sexual Slavery
Child Brides

Forced Labor

Child Soldiers
Adoption Trafficking
Organ Trafficking
Trafficked Athletes

And now a new one I should have seen coming.

Those very young, foreign models you see? Some of them were trafficked by model scouts who
literally trawled through some of the most destitute and vulnerable people on earth for them. The
same methods as other predatory traffickers; Go to politically or economically unstable areas,
locate 5'11 beautiful young girls; buy them, import them, own them, use them.

Horrible irony to have images that portray us to the world possibly be of slaves.

It’s hard to think of an area of our society that doesn't admire seeing it's most vaunted members
with a model on their arm. While this observation does not imply that those people were
trafficked, imagine how simple that makes it to approach a child or it’s family anywhere in the

world and offer them this in return for absolute control.

All the traffickers have to do is pull out a magazine or phone with videos on it.
