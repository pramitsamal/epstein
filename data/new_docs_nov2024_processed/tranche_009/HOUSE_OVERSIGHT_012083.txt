right camps. So far, Macron has fostered a good rapport with
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom we expect to be re-
elected in September. The political risk in continental Europe
is now centered in Italy, but we were encouraged that its far-
left Five Star Movement suffered key defeats in recent regional
elections, which could bode well for their next national elec-
tion, likely to occur next spring.

In addition to Italy, Brexit remains a large political risk for
2018 as the weakened Tories will be negotiating with at best
a tenuous alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)
and at worst may face another election and lose power alto-
gether. We believe it is too soon to make major portfolio shifts
based on Brexit, but we are watching this closely as substan-
tial progress in negotiations will need to materialize months
ahead of the March 2019 deadline. By this time next year, we
would expect to see traction in negotiations and stability in
Parliament or begin to consider reducing exposure to the Brit-
ish pound and companies exposed to that economy.

Aging Business Models

The “FANG” stocks—Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google
—have disrupted countless business models while seeing their
own revenues and market values soar. Empty storefronts from
Manhattan to malls in Middle America are evidence of the
disruption facing rapidly aging business models like brick-and-
mortar retail. When you include Apple and Microsoft in the
FANG stocks, the six companies account for 12.83% of the S&P
500 Index. At the start of this bull market on March 9, 2009,
these companies had a market value of $326 billion. Today,
their market value is $2.97 trillion. Their sheer size alone
suggests that they cannot keep compounding like they have. To
maintain its ascent, the U.S. bull market will need new sectors
to emerge as market leaders. The challenge will be economic

growth. Companies that disrupt mature businesses, like many
of the FANG stocks have, typically have not relied on a robust
global economy to generate their amazing revenue growth.
Most other sectors in the S&P 500 Index, however, would likely
benefit from a stronger economy.

Summary and Conclusion

Many bull markets have interesting back stories as to how they
begin and end. The latest bull market can arguably be traced
back to March 9, 2009 when the CEO of Citibank, Vikram
Pandit, released a memo to employees announcing that the
company was having its best quarter since early 2007. The
market embraced that memo as a sign the worst was over,
especially for the beleaguered banking sector. The S&P 500
rallied from that day and eight years later is up nearly four-fold.
As we consider future returns, valuation matters. In March
2009, the S&P 500 was selling for roughly 10 times depressed
earnings and is now selling for about 18.7 times. The U.S.
market leads the world in innovative companies and is priced
for it.

As we look for opportunities overseas, we see political fortunes
improving in Europe with some lingering headwinds that may
appear in 2018. We could argue the same in the U.S. as the
leadership in the House of Representatives can easily switch
parties next year. If Europe can continue its economic improve-
ment, we see the potential for more gains ahead for the region
after a robust start to 2017.

The emerging markets offer some attractive valuations, but are
not likely to be a panacea for global growth as the largest ones
face the same challenges of aging and maturing development
that confront most of the developed world. This bull market
may keep moving, but like all of us past a certain age, not at a
pace that we are used to. @
