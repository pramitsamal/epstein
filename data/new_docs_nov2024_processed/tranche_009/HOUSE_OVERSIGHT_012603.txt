Re: Subpoena to Custodian of Records.
‘Dear Mr. Lefcourt:
, < I write in response to your letter of July 18, 2007 regarding the grand jury subpoena issued
SF to the Custodian of Records for NES, LLC. Ihave attached an identical subpoena containing aretum’

date of September 11, 2007, and subpoenas for two NES employees, Eric Gany and Harry Beller.
if you will not be representing Messrs. Gany and Beller, please let me know.

First, as [mentioned in my earlier correspondence, a properly executed declaration from the
Custodian of Records is needed, and, ifno documents responsive to a particular request exist, the
Custodian should certify that under penalty of perjury.

Second, you write that NES has no documents responsive to Requests 1 through 5. I know fg
that NES has several credit card accounts for the benefit of the persons who manage Mr. Epstcin’s Dy
properties, inchiding Janusz Banasiak and Alfredo Rodriguez. I also know that NES regularly ee
receives money from an account that is used to pay expenses at 358 El Brillo Way and also wires
money to that same account. Those. wire transfers fall within the time period called for by the
subpoena and number in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. If NES does not maintain records of
its banking activities, then I would like to see a copy of its document retention policy, so I have
added that to the Attachment to the Subpoena. ;

Third, Mt. Menchel’s comment to you about potential money laundering charges related only
to aresolution of the case. In other words, if the sex offense case is resolved, the Office would close
its investigation into other areas as well. The matter has not been, and it does not appear that it will
be, resolved so the money laundering investigation continues, and Request Number 6 will not be
withdrawn. The request is not overbroad and is stated with particularity, so please comply with the fo
’ request by the new deadline. owe F
