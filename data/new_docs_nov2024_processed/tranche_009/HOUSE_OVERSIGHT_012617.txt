is definitely under 18 still, and | think there is a second minor. The appointment of #8
Hidteiast ad litem is to provide you with a mechanism to make contact with the girls and to give
them the assistance of an independent attorney who represents them (as opposed to me, who
represents the government). If you are willing to provide the girls with independent counsel, at
Mr. Epstein’s expense (and | get to pick the attorney), that is alright with me.

Will do. AlS8, WHY do you need a guardian ad litem at all? Are any of the 40 under 18 now?
