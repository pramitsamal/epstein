psychological data. Opinions differ as to whether this sort of modeling is valuable for achieving
AGI goals. CogPrime is not designed to support this kind of modeling, as it intentionally does
many things very differently from humans.

ACT-R in its original form did not say much about perceptual and motor operations, but
recent versions have incorporated EPIC, an independent cognitive architecture focused on mod-
eling these aspects of human behavior.

4.2.3 Cyc and Texai

Our review of cognitive architectures would be incomplete without mentioning Cye [LG90],
one of the best known and best funded AGIL-oriented projects in history. While the main focus
of the Cyc project has been on the hand-coding of large amounts of declarative knowledge,
there is also a cognitive architecture of sorts there. The center of Cyc is an engine for logical
deduction, acting on knowledge represented in predicate logic. A natural language engine has
been associated with the logic engine, which enables one to ask English questions and get
English replies.

Stephen Reed, while an engineer at Cycorp, designed a perceptual-motor front end for Cyc
based on James Albus’ Reference Model Architecture; the ensuing system, called Cognitive-
Cyc, would have been the first full-fledged cognitive architecture based on Cyc, but was not
implemented. Reed left Cycorp and is now building a system called Texai, which has many
similarities to Cyc (and relies upon the OpenCyc knowledge base, a subset of Cyc’s overall
knowledge base), but incorporates a CognitiveCyc style cognitive architecture.
