176 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World

9.7 The Extended Mind and Body

Finally, Hutchins [Hut95], Logan [Log07| and others have promoted a view of human intelli-
gence that views the human mind as extended beyond the individual body, incorporating social
interactions and also interactions with inanimate objects, such as tools, plants and animals.
This leads to a number of requirements for a humanlike AGI’s environment:

1. The ability to create a variety of different tools for interacting with various aspects of the
world in various different ways, including tools for making tools and ultimately machinery

2. The existence of other mobile, virtual life-forms in the world, including simpler and less
intelligent ones, and ones that interact with each other and with the AGI

3. The existence of organic growing structures in the world, with which the AGI can interact
in various ways, including halting their growth or modifying their growth pattern

How necessary these requirements are is hard to say — but it is clear that these things have
played a major role in the evolution of human intelligence.

9.8 Conclusion

Happily, this diverse chapter supports a simple, albeit tentative conclusion. Our suggestion is
that, if an AGI is

e placed in an environment capable of roughly supporting multimodal communication and
vaguely (but not necessarily precisely) real-world-ish naive physics

e surrounded with other intelligent agents of varying levels of complexity, and other complex,
dynamic structures to interface with

e given a body that can perceive this environment through some forms of sight, sound and
touch; and perceive itself via some form of kinesthesia

e given a motivational system that encourages it to make rich use of these aspects of its
environment

then the AGI is likely to have an experience-base reinforcing the key inductive biases provided
by the everyday world for the guidance of humanlike intelligence.
