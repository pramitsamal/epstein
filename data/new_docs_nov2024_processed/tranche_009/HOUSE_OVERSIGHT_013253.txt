Glossary of Specialized Terms 337

MOSES (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search): An algorithm for proce-
dure learning, which in the current implementation learns programs in the Combo language.
MOSES is an evolutionary learning system, which differs from typical genetic programming
systems in multiple aspects including: a subtler framework for managing multiple demes”
or “islands” of candidate programs; a library called Reduct for placing programs in Elegant
Normal Form; and the use of probabilistic modeling in place of, or in addition to, mutation
and crossover as means of determining which new candidate programs to try.

Motoric: Pertaining to the control of physical actuators, e.g. those connected to a robot.
May sometimes be used to refer to the control of movements of a virtual character as well.
Moving Bubble of Attention: The Attentional Focus of a CogPrime system.

Natural Language Comprehension: See Language Comprehension

Natural Language Generation: See Language Generation

Natural Language Processing (NLP): See Language Processing

NLGen: Software for carrying out the surface realization phase of natural language gen-
eration, via translating collections of RelEx output relationships into English sentences.
Was made functional for simple sentences and some complex sentences; not currently under
active development, as work has shifted to the related Atom2Link approach to language
generation.

Node: A type of Atom. Links and Nodes are the two basic kinds of Atoms. Nodes, math-
ematically, can be thought of as O-ary links. Some types of Nodes refer to external or
mathematical entities (e.g. WordNode, NumberNode); others are purely abstract, e.g. a
ConceptNode is characterized purely by the Links relating it to other atoms. Grounded-
PredicateNodes and GroundedSchemaNodes connect to explicitly represented procedures
(sometimes in the Combo language); ungrounded PredicateNodes and SchemaNodes are
abstract and, like ConceptNodes, purely characterized by their relationships.

Node Probability: Many PLN inference rules rely on probabilities associated with Nodes.
Node probabilities are often easiest to interpret in a specific context, e.g. the probability
P(cat) makes obvious sense in the context of a typical American house, or in the context
of the center of the sun. Without any contextual specification, P(A) is taken to mean
the probability that a randomly chosen occasion of the system’s experience includes some
instance of A.

Novamente Cognition Engine (NCE): A proprietary proto-AGI software system, the
predecessor to OpenCog. Many parts of the NCE were open-sourced to form portions of
OpenCog, but some NCE code was not included in OpenCog; and now OpenCog includes
multiple aspects and plenty of code that was not in NCE.

OpenCog: A software framework intended for development of AGI systems, and also for
narrow-AI application using tools that have AGI applications. Co-designed with the Cog-
Prime cognitive architecture, but not exclusively bound to it.

OpenCog Prime (OCP): The implementation of the CogPrime cognitive architecture
within the OpenCog software framework.

OpenPsi: CogPrime’s architecture for motivation-driven action selection, which is based
on adapting Dorner’s Psi model for use in the OpenCog framework.

Operational Agent Controller (OAC): In some OpenCog configurations, this is a soft-
ware server containing a CogServer devoted to real-time control of an agent (e.g. a virtual
world agent, or a robot). Background, offline learning tasks may then be dispatched to other
software processes, e.g. to a Learning Server.
