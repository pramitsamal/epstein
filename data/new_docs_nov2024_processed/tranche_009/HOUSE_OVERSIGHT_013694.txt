computer experimental findings had already been anticipated in a remarkable

mathematical proof by Sharkovskii (1964).

The dynamical richness of these simple, single maximum, one dimensional
maps was computationally explored in the context of ecological and epidemiological
issues in the classical studies of Robert May (1976). It has been possible to relate
the individually characteristic L, R sequence behavior of human subjects on a
computer task to a unique parameter of a tent map generating those sequences
which predicted age and discriminated subclinical obsessive compulsive from
borderline syndromes (Selz and Mandell, 1993). The dynamical entropy of
unstructured L,R behavior also discriminated a population of schizophrenic patients
from normals (Paulus et al, 1996). More generally, parameter dependent dynamical
coding, built into the universal behavior of its constitutive equations, is a mechanism
with which a nonlinear dynamical system, such as nerve membrane equations as
above, or in the aggregate, the middle layer of a completely connected neural

network, can encode, Morse code-like, messages (Paulus et al, 1989).

Bifurcations in Biologically Relevant Dynamical Systems

Bifurcations, “splitting into (two) branches,” are observed over a smooth
change in control parameter(s) (independent variables), as a discontinuous and
qualitative change in the dynamical (time-dependent) pattern of the observable
(Guckenheimer and Holmes, 1993; Wiggens, 1990; see Strogatz, 1994, for a
particularly intuitive description). Qualitative here means how the dynamics of the
trajectory appear as a geometric-topological (relative shaped not necessarily sized)
pattern in phase space. In such a space, the orbital points are located along the x-
axis by their value, x at time f, and along the y-axis by their time rate of change at
