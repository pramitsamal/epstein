Finding Public Domain Information to Repurpose

Be sure to speak with an intellectual property attorney before using apparent public domain material. If
someone modifies 20% of a public domain work (through abridging and footnotes, for example), their
“new” complete work can be copyrighted. Using it without permission would then be a punishable
infringement. The details can get confusing. Do the beginning research yourself, but get a pro to look
over your findings before moving ahead with product development.

public domain.

> LibriVox ( www.librivox.org )

Recording Seminars or Phone Interviews with Experts for CD Downloadable Products

~ HotRecorder ( www.hotrecorder.com ) (PC), Call Recorder (
http://ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/_) (Mac)

Use these programs to record any inbound or outbound phone call via computer using Skype
(www.skype.com) and other VoIP programs.

= NoCost Conference ( www.nocostconference.com )

Provides a free 800-number conference line, as well as free recording and file retrieval. Normal phones
can be used for call-in, so no computer or web connection is required for participants. If you’ll have a
Q&A, I suggest soliciting attendee questions beforehand to avoid issues with muting/ unmuting of lines.
