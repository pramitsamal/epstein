7 is in Hawaii. Can we find some girls for him?

8 QO. And what was your reaction to that?

i) A. Well, I was massaging and I didn't have a

11 five years.

12 Q. Did Jeffrey ever take you shopping?

13 A Yes.

14 Q. Can you describe for me what happened?

15 A Sure. He took me to Victoria's Secret. I

16 believe he picked out everything and went into the
17 room with me, the fitting room, which was very odd.
18 en Did he make any comments about being in
19 the fitting room with you?

20 A. He joked that one time he was in there
ZI. with another girl, and she said something like

22 Dad. But that's all I recall.

23 cr Did Jeffrey ever talk to you -- let me
