The combination of these factors suggest Japanese equities have further to run. We also
see the position as being complementary to our EM position since whereas a stronger
USD is a drag on EM performance, it is beneficial for the NKY position.

Curve movements based on 2yr move and 2510s move (Bloomberg US Treasury yield index), so includes twist movernents, but even if we exclude these implications do not materially change.
Bear steepening (2yr + 16bps, 2510s +33bps) = 11 quarters, bear flattening (2yr +26bps, 2510s -20bps) = 10 quarters, bull steepening (2yr -48bps, 2510s +28bps) = 10 quarters, bull flattening (2yr -
27 ps, 2510s -30bps) = 12 quarters

Long Europe equities via yield stocks & index dividends

We continue to run two yield related trades in European equities. First, we remain long a
broad selection of high yielding European equities. The dividend yield on offer in
European equities is one of the asset class’s key attractions. Europe offers a higher
dividend yield than the other regions, with a 1.1% yield pick-up versus the DM average
and 0.9% against EM equities. Those also look attractive relative to history: Europe’s
yield spread to DM ranks at the 87 percentile of the 20-year range. Europe’s DY also
looks attractive relative to sovereign and corporate bonds despite the recent sell off in
fixed income markets: the yield pick-up relative to investment grade corporates is still
289bp. Given the concerns over European politics we prefer yield based strategies in
Europe to those looking for capital appreciation at least in the short term.

European Yield Screen

The rising rates backdrop has left yield not quite as scarce as it has been, but we
continue to think investors should own yield where they can get it at decent value, such
as in European equities. Last month we recommended investors rotate out of lower risk
