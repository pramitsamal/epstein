defensive dividend stocks to take advantage of the improving cyclical backdrop and
rising bond yields. That meant our November screen included a high proportion of
Financials. This somewhat remains the case but we note the addition of several
industrial companies in our latest screen. As a reminder, to qualify the stock must be
SXXP listed stocks with at least €2bn market cap, 4% DY, 1.2x DPS cover, 0% DPS 2YR
CAGR and qualifying stocks must be on a Buy rating from our fundamental analysts. The

yield on the basket is 5% with an average DPS CAGR of 7% and 1.8x covered.

Long SX5E 2018 Index dividend futures
With our second dividend related trade, we remain long SX5E 2018 index dividend

futures (DEDZ8), a trade where we continue to see value even with the future price
trading close to the high for the year. The 2018 contract implies a 4% decline in
dividends paid from the 2016 level. In the absence of a recession, we think that is too
pessimistic — 2013 was the last year to see a material 2-year decline in dividends (in the
wake of the sovereign crisis and recession). The 2018 contract also still trades at a
discount to the level implied by our stock analysts’ DPS forecasts. Our derivative
Strategists using BofAML forecasts for 2018 estimate 8% upside from current prices.
Although the upside is now more limited the risk around this trade is also much lower
now. The pull to par effect will become the dominant driver over the coming months and
the full year results should provide clarity on where the 2018 contract will settle.
