Politics — populism in the Eurozone?

Few predicted that the UK would vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump would win the
US presidential election in 2016, least of all pollsters (and many in markets). As Michael
Hartnett argues, the rise of populism can be linked to what he refers to as Peak
Inequality and Peak Globalisation. Trump and the Brexit campaign tapped into deep
apathy with the socio-economic order that for them remains unreformed post-GFC.
That’s why the poster boy for this dislocation is often the blue collar voter whose
standards of living have not been rising in the increasingly globalised world. The crucial
question for investors as we enter a busy year for European politics (see table opposite}
is whether the populism train will gather pace or terminate at the Eurozone.

Italy risks elevated, but risks two way and banks the bigger issue

Although Italy goes to the polls this year, it is worthwhile starting with this Sunday’s
vote. In Strategy Insights: Italy risks elevated we argue that our base case is a narrow
rejection of the proposed constitutional reform, which is another vote against governing
party on Dec 4. But unlike UK/ US, this would be expected and Renzi is likely to stay on
so the outcome should not carry the same surprise or uncertainty factor for markets.
The tail risk are also two way. A large “No” vote could perceived as supportive of the 5
star movement but a “Yes” vote would be bullish Italy and risk assets more generally.
The bigger issue is likely recapitalisation of the Italian banks. This remains a significant
tail risk for banks and was part of why we downgraded the sector.

A Le Pen victory could prove the biggest risk to European markets in 2017
Probably the most natural fit for the populism theme in 2017 is the French presidential
election. Although polls have been somewhat discredited by events this year they
remain useful as an indication of where the public mood lies. With that caveat in mind,
current voting intentions suggests Front National leader Marine Le Pen will receive
enough votes to progress to the second round and is likely to be joined by Republican
candidate Francois Fillon. Although when Fillon and Le Pen are polled together in a
second round runoff Fillon is ahead by ~65%-35%, Le Pen is seen as capable of
appealing to the same anti-establishment / blue collar voters as Trump/ Brexit.

Investors’ biggest concerns are that we could see the same narrowing of polls in favour
of Le Pen into the election months as we saw in the UK/US. We think this could mean
French political risk becomes a major overhang for European equities in H1 2017. The
worry is that a Le Pen Presidency could bring the future of the EU and the Euro into
question as she has talked about France withdrawing from both and is especially an
issue because of the winner takes it all nature of French presidential elections. As James
