when China’s leadership intervened in the local
equity markets and adjusted the trading band
around the renminbi, and by 104 basis points in
late 2015 and early 2016 when the leadership
changed the reference currency from the dollar to a
basket of 13 currencies. If US financial conditions
had stayed at those levels for over a year, US
GDP growth would have slowed by about one
percentage point, all else being equal. Financial
conditions are the mechanism by which shocks
from China would have the most immediate

impact on key developed economies such as the US.

As mentioned above, one of the triggers of
US recessions has been economic imbalances.
While we do not see such imbalances in the US,
or in other major developed economies, at this
time, we see significant imbalances in China. Such
imbalances have led to crises in other countries,
and there is no reason to believe that they will not
lead to a financial crisis in China. In our view, it is
not a question of if—it is only a question of when.

The biggest imbalance in China is the high level
of debt relative to GDP. The Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) has a series of early warning
indicators. One of the more widely followed
and reliable measures is the credit-to-GDP gap,
measured as the total credit extended to the
private nonfinancial sector as a percentage of GDP
compared with its long-term trend. As shown in
Exhibit 27, China breached the high-risk threshold
in June 2012, when its credit-to-GDP gap rose
above the 10% level. At 30.1% as of March
2016 (latest data available) and rising, China’s
gap exceeds the 10% threshold by 20 percentage
points, levels previously seen in Spain before the
European sovereign debt crisis. Major developed
and emerging market countries have experienced a
financial crisis within three years of their credit-to-
GDP gap exceeding 10%.

In our 2016 Outlook and our 2016 Insight
report, Walled In: China’s Great Dilemma, we
stated that we did not expect a hard landing in
China over the next two years—2016 and 2017.
We continue to assign a low probability to a hard
landing in China in 2017. However, it is unlikely
that China can avoid a financial crisis over the
next three years. In prior years, we have pointed to
China’s high savings rate and government control
of many aspects of the economy as reasons for
its ability to avert a hard landing. However, the
country’s debt levels have risen rapidly, the pace
of capital outflows has picked up, and net foreign

direct investment has reversed and is now negative.
In our view, neither China’s high savings rate nor
its increasing government control of financial
markets and capital flows will be sufficient to avert
a hard landing over the next several years. Keep
in mind that even the US was not able to avert a
financial crisis after its credit-to-GDP gap briefly
breached the 10% high-risk threshold in December
2006 and peaked at 12.4% in December 2007.
The US has the highest GDP per capita of any
major country in the world. The large countries
that come closest to the US on this score have
GDP per capita levels that stand at about 70% of
US levels on a nominal basis and slightly higher
on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. The US
dollar is also the unquestioned reserve currency
of the world; its reserve-currency status has only
been fortified after the Eurozone sovereign debt
crisis and the British referendum for Brexit. Thus,
the US is able to access the excess savings of the
entire world. The US also receives the largest share
of world foreign direct investment flows, capturing
14% of global flows between 2011 and 2015.
The US now accounts for 20% of the stock of all
foreign direct investment. Yet, despite all these
major advantages, it did not avert a financial crisis
in 2008. It defies logic to assume that China will
be the one major country that avoids a financial
crisis and a hard landing when it does not enjoy
such advantages. As we often say, stating that “this
