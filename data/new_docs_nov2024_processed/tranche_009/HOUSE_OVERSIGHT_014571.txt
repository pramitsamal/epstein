Last year witnessed a growing repudiation of
this status quo, evident in the surprise outcome
of the UK and Italian referenda, as well as US
presidential election. As we begin 2017, these
winds of change are gaining force. Central banks
are acknowledging the often counterproductive
impact of ultra-easy monetary policy and
shifting attention to the eventual withdrawal of
accommodation. At the same time, the recovery
in commodity prices and recent firming in global
growth is shifting the focus from deflation to
reflation. The same could be said of the increasing
focus on expansionary fiscal policy.

While this change brings hope, it also carries
risk. In the US, fiscal stimulus arrives eight years
into an economic expansion that is already near
full employment, increasing the danger of the
economy overheating. Although the Federal
Reserve could respond by hastening the pace
of rate hikes, it might overdo it. Similarly, an
overzealous negotiating stance on existing trade
relationships or imposition of protectionist policies
by the incoming US administration could staunch
the flow of trade—an outcome that would be
particularly damaging to emerging markets. And
in Europe, a victory of the far right in the French
presidential election could unleash fears about
France exiting the European Union and endanger
the survival of the euro.

Still, we do not yet accord a high enough
probability to these risks to alter our base case,
which assumes these winds of change fill the sails
of the ongoing global recovery, rather than capsize
it (see Exhibit 29).

United States: Age Is Just a Number

The US economic expansion is getting old by
historical standards. At nearly eight years, it is
already the fourth-longest in post-WWII history
and poised to be among the top three by the
middle of this year (see Exhibit 30). Concern that
the economy’s vigor is finally succumbing to its
advanced age was only bolstered by anemic 1.6%
real GDP growth in 2016, close to the weakest of
any year during the recovery.

But as we have argued in the past and as
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently noted,
“it’s a myth that expansions die of old age.”!°
