experiencing liquidity problems or are at risk of
breaching financial covenants. As seen in Exhibit
85, Moody’s composite Liquidity Stress Index
(LSI) began to deteriorate in advance of previous
default cycles. Third, the commodity sectors of the
high yield universe—which collectively generated
a staggering 85% of last year’s defaults—are
recovering along with oil prices. Keep in mind
that the par-weighted default rate excluding
these sectors was just 0.5% last year, a fraction
of the 3.2% long-run average.” Finally, our
default model—which incorporates the leading
characteristics of the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan
Officer Opinion Survey and the percentage of
distressed bonds—is projecting 2-3% par-weighted
defaults in the year ahead.

Other factors corroborate our low-default view.
As seen in Exhibit 86, there is very little refinancing

risk, given that less than 10% of existing debt
matures in the next two years. Of equal importance,
interest coverage stands near all-time highs today,
in stark contrast to the period preceding the
financial crisis (see Exhibit 87). This point is further
illustrated by Exhibit 88, which shows that today’s
high yield universe is much healthier than the pre-
crisis cohort, regardless of measure. Keep in mind
that low-rated CCC bonds represented just 8% of
high yield issuance last year, a 14-year low.

We also note that high yield may be a better
interest rate hedge than many investors realize.
Consider that during unexpected interest rate
backups in the past, high yield has generated a
positive return 69% of the time and a return that
exceeded investment grade fixed income 85%
of the time (see Exhibit 89). This last point is
important, as our high yield overweight is funded
out of investment grade fixed income.
High yield’s hedging qualities were
apparent last year, as the asset class
appreciated nearly 7% in the second
half of the year despite an increase in
Treasury yields of more than 100 basis
points. Although we assume that any
further increase in 10-year Treasury
rates this year will not be offset by high
yield spreads, this historical relationship

suggests that may be overly conservative.
