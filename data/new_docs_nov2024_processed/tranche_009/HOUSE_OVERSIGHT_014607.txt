2017 Global Commodity Outlook

After losing more than half its value in the span
of two years, the S&P GSCI broke its downward
trend with an 11% gain in 2016, its first double-
digit return since 2009 (see Exhibit 92). The
rebound in oil prices was a key contributor, as oil
finished the year with a staggering 52% spot price
gain—an outcome made all the more remarkable
by the fact that oil was down 25% at its worst
point early last year. This strength was not limited
to the oil patch, as industrial metals rallied 17%
on average and precious metals advanced 8% (see
Exhibit 93).

Despite last year’s broad-based gains, we are
more circumspect about the outlook for 2017.
While we expect oil to advance, it begins the
year closer to the midpoint of our target range,

Exhibit 93: Commodity Returns in 2016

providing a more balanced risk/reward profile.
Meanwhile, we believe the key elements of
our macroeconomic forecast—Federal Reserve
tightening, rising interest rates, modest US dollar
gains and average inflation—represent continued
headwinds to gold prices. Comparable headwinds
exist for industrial metals and agricultural goods,
given the continued slowdown we expect in
Chinese growth.

We discuss the specifics of our outlook for oil
and gold in the sections that follow.

Oil: Regaining Its Balance

Oil is finding its footing again after having
stumbled dramatically over the last two years.
While the market is still awash in oil inventories,
the sizable reductions in capital expenditures by
the largest international oil and gas companies

Most commodity subcomponents saw positive returns in 2016, reversing several years of declines.

* Excess return corresponds to the actual return from being invested in the front-month contract and differs from spot price return, depending on the shape of the forward curve. An upward-sloping
curve (contango) is negative for returns, while a downward-sloping curve (backwardation) is positive.
