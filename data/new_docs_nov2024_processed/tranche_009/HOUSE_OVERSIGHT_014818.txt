The FBI case revealed sexual allegations by at least 20 girls, however, Epstein struck a deal with
prosecutors and served 13 months' jail for soliciting child prostitution.

Ms Roberts stayed working as Epstein's masseuse until she met an Australian martial arts
expert named Robert.

The pair married, causing an enraged Epstein to cut off the then 19-year-old.

Ms Roberts said she was coming to grips with her exploitation. Three years ago she was
contacted by the FBI who found photos and secret videos of her during their investigations.

The case forced Ms Roberts to deal with her abuse and also reveal it to her husband.

I couldn't bring myself to tell him much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out,”
she told The Mail.

While Epstein's plea deal meant her identity was hidden, Ms Roberts said after seeing a picture
of the pair shopping she had to go public. I am appalled. To me, it's saying 'We are above the
law'. But Jeffrey is a monster. Both Epstein and Prince Andrew refused to comment.
