SX7E implied-realised correlation near 5 year high, driven by stock-level divergence
SX7E 6m implied correlation has fallen since Mar-17 but the implied-realised correlation
spread remains in the 88 5 year percentile (Chart 19). Notably, the low SX7E 6m
realised correlation in 2017 was mostly driven by company-specific rather than region-
specific divergence (Chart 20).
