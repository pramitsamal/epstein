| first woke up at the age of six.

It began with an itch in my leg. My left leg. But somehow | knew |
wasn't supposed to scratch it. Although my eyes were closed, | was
standing up. In fact, | was standing on a huge stage. And | was playing the
violin. | was in the middle of playing the “Vivaldi Concerto in A Minor.” |
was wearing a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit-ruffled white silk shirt with puffy
sleeves, black velvet short pants with ivory buttons and matching
vest-white socks and black patent-leather shoes. My hair was platinum
blond and wavy. On this particular Saturday evening—January 14, 1939-I
was in the process of becoming the youngest concert artist in any field
ever to perform at Carnegie Hall. But all | knew was that | was being
taunted by an itch. An itch that had become my adversary.

| was tempted to stop playing the violin, just for a second, and
scratch my leg with the bow, yet | was vaguely aware that this would not
be appropriate. | had been well trained. | was a true professional. But that
itch kept getting fiercer and fiercer. Then, suddenly, an impulse surfaced
from my hidden laboratory of alternative possibilities, and | surrendered to
it. Balancing on my left foot, | scratched my left leg with my right foot,

without missing a note of the “Vivaldi Concerto.”
