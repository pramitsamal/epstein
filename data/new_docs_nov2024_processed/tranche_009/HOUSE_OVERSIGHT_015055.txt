wears glasses. Sometimes while the commercial is on, the actors have
reconciliation. It is a real fun show.

Mommy and Daddy live in New York State. To get a divorce there,
one of them has to commit adultery. Daddy has a tryst with a girl. Mommy
raids the joint. She brings along a photographer. Mommy has secretly
been having an affair with the photographer. What Daddy doesn’ t know
won’ t hurt him. He always wanted to be on Page 3 of the Daily News
anyhow. Mommy made sure that his undershorts were ironed.

Benjamin Brenner lives in Brooklyn. He is a Supreme Court Justice
there. He makes decisions. He decided that raiding the joint is illegal from
now on. Unless you have a search warrant. Then it’ s legal, but you have
to knock first and say, “Benny sent me.” This new rule doesn’ t count for
hotel rooms. Then it’ s okay to raid the joint. So Daddy better get his own
apartment. Judge Brenner is really under the thumb of real-estate agents.

There is another way. Mommy can go to Reno. She lives there for six
weeks. That is called “establishing residence.” Reno is Keno but Alabama
is Clamor. Same-day service. The Chamber of Commerce invites lawyers to
practice there. They are promised the run of the divorce mill. More people

are traveling to Alabama than ever before. They are called Freedom Riders.
