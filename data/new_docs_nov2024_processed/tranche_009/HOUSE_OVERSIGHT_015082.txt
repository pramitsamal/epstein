the late Marilyn Monroe using the telephone in her Hollywood bathroom
to make a long distance call to New York Post film-gossip columnist
Sidney Skolsky.

“Sid, you won't believe this,“ she had whispered, “but the
Attorney General of our country is waiting for me in my bed this very

minute--I just had to tell you.”

It is difficult to ascertain where on the continuum of Lyndon
Johnson's personality innocent boorishness ends and deliberate sadism
begins. To have summoned then-Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon
for a conference wherein he, the new president, sat defecating as he spoke,
might charitably be an example of the former; but to challenge under the
same circumstances Senator J. William Fulbright for his opposition to
Administration policy in Vietnam is considered by insiders to be a
frightening instance of the latter. The more Jacqueline Kennedy has tried
to erase the crudeness of her husband's successor from consciousness, the
more it has impinged upon her memories and reinforced her resentment.

“It's beyond style,” she would confide to friends. “Jack had style, but

this is beyond style.”
