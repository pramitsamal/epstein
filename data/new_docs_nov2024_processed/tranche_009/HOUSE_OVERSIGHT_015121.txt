“No, | mean my so-called marriage is all image. Pat and | have not,
you know, slept together for many years. My God, | was the President of
the Unites States, and | couldn’ t even get laid by my own wife.”

“Sir, you don’ t really want to talk about this--

“And I’ Il tell you where it started. During the Cuban Crisis in
October ' 62. Boy, Kennedy sure won a helluva lot of points on that one.
And it could’ ve been me confronting Khrushchev. | mean a real
international shootdown, not just waving my finger at him in Safire’ s
goddamn makeshift kitchen.”

“That would have been the logical extension of your Russian trip.”

“| tell you, the unspeakable frustration of not being in a position to
negotiate that missile thing. | just couldn’ t get it up for Pat, plus the
pressure of the California campaign was going on then too. And after we
lost that election, she started talking about a divorce. We compromised
with separate bedrooms.”

Suddenly | stood up, walked around my desk to where Haldeman
was sitting, and | ran my hand back and forth across the top of his
crewcut. | am not very physically demonstrative, but | had always wanted

to do that. Still, this was almost a spontaneous gesture.
