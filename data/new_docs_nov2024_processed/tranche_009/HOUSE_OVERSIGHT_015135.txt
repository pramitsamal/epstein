and | once had an extreme/y animated discussion on the decriminalization
of abortion. Can you imagine what the Democrats would’ ve done with
that?

And that was the precise instant | made the decision to leak
Professor Hill’ s statement to the press. Although | have constantly been
sexually Aass/ed, | have never really been harassed in the /ega/sense of the
word. However, | Aave had an abortion, and | was totally outraged by the
blatant hypocrisy I’ d overheard. | had never leaked a document before,
but my anger overshadowed my fear.

| chose Nina Totenberg because | had come to trust her reporting
about the Supreme Court on National Public Radio. | honestly had no idea
what leaking the affidavit would accomplish. | certainly did not envision
that it would literally embarrass the Senate into delaying the vote until
public hearings were held, though that probably was my secret desire.

But Judge Thomas testified under oath that he had never discussed
the subject of abortion. However, in response to a question by Senator
Hank Brown, Professor Hill testified that she had disagreed with Judge
Thomas in a discussion about Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, then-Senator
Joseph Biden quickly interrupted her.

“That is not the subject of these hearings,” he said.
