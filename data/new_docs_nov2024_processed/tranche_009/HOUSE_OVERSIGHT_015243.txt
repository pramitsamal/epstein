towards acceptance of brutal criminal activity.”

Konformist editor Sterling wrote to Phillips:

“| harbored no personal animosity to either you or Ms. O’ Brien,
but | had serious questions about the accuracy of what was in your book.
Even more disturbing, | had a very bad feeling that, wittingly or not, the
claims in 7rance Formation could easily be used to manipulate people into
a hysterical witch-hunt state, and could be used to smear those who are
innocent of charges made by you and Cathy, Brice and others. | felt if
people were not careful, they could be whipped into a fascist state of
mindlessly agreeing to any charge made by alleged CIA sex slaves to a
conspiracy underground version of McCarthyism.”

The “Brice” he refers to is Brice Taylor, author of the first
competitor of 7rance Formation, published in 1999—Thanks for the
Memories: The Memoirs of Bob Hope’ s and Henry Kissinger’ s Mind-
Controlled Slave—in which she asserts that Walt Disney raped her on Mr.
Toad’ s Wild Ride; that she had sex with all three Kennedy brothers plus
JFK, Jr. when he was 12; and that she has cavorted with public figures
ranging from Prince Charles to Alan Greenspan, from Elvis Presley to Neil

Diamond, from Johnny Carson to Ed McMahon. “Hi-yo!”
