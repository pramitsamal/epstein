During the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, | was among
15,000 protesters who had gathered in Grant Park for a rally when the
police, triggered by the actions of one of their own provocateurs, attacked
the demonstrators and sadistically beat as many as they could reach. It
seemed impossible that we could ever work within the system. But now,

same park, giddy with the excitement of Obama’ s victory. They had
worked within the system.

During the past four decades, there has been a linear progression
from Jimi Hendrix playing “The Star-Spangled Banner” at Woodstock to
Aretha Franklin singing “My Country,‘ tis of Thee” at the inauguration.
Is it possible that this event signified the early tremors of a nonviolent
revolution? As the late singer/songwriter Harry Chapin once said to me
backstage at a benefit: “If you don’ t act like there’ s hope, there /s no
hope.” And remember, placebos work. My hope is | don’ t get

disappointed. [But | did.]
