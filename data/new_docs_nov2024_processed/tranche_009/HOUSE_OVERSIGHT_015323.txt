Meanwhile, the memorabilia business flourishes as millions of voters
seek a variety of tangible items to remind them of the part they played in
history simply by voting. Mouse pads, baby bibs, aprons, dog jerseys,
bobble-heads, niche buttons ( “Ventriloquists for Obama” ), T-shirts (

“Now | Don’ t Have to Move to Canada” ) and, as reported by NPR,
Obama condoms. Somebody bid $400 on eBay for the November 5th issue
of the New York Times. USA Today printed 500,000 extra copies; the
Washington Post printed 350,000 extras. The only thing | saved was a full-
page ad by the 99 Cents Only stores, which included a “Joe the Plumber

Special” plunger. There was no limit on how many | could buy.
