By the sheer power of numbers without the necessity of stunts, the
Occupiers have broadened public awareness about the economic injustice
perpetuated by corporations without compassion conspiring with
government corruption that has resulted in immeasurable suffering. The
Yippies were a myth that became a reality. The Occupiers are a reality that
became a myth. The spirit of nonviolent revolution is what connects them.

NPR waited until eleven days of Occupy Wall Street had passed
before reporting its existence. The executive news editor explained that the
Occupiers “did not involve large numbers of people” (actually, there
were already several hundred), no “prominent people” showed up (thus
ignoring Michael Moore and Susan Sarandon), the lack of “a great
disruption” (the police pepper-spraying protesters trapped in a cage of
orange netting finally met that need), “or an especially clear objective”
(oh, right, like all those flip-floppy pandering politicians whose clear
objective is to get elected).

The Occupiers appear to be a leaderless community—most likely,
you can’ t name a single one; not yet, anyway—whereas Abbie Hoffman,
Jerry Rubin and | served as spokespeople for the Yippies. We had media

contacts and knew how to speak in sound bytes. If we gave good quote,
