Radioactive Carbon-14: Your pearly whites

When you smile, the gleam of your teeth obscures a
slight glow from radioactive waste. During the late
1950s and early 1960s, atmospheric testing of thermo-
nuclear weapons scattered so much radioactive car-
bon-14 into the atmosphere that 1t contaminated vir-
tually every ecosystem and human. Several thousand
unstable radiocarbon atoms explode within and among
your cells every second as their unstable nuclei under-
go spontaneous radioactive decay. Some are the natu-
ral products of cosmic rays that can turn atmospheric
nitrogen into carbon-14, while others result from the
decay of unstable mineral elements that are found in
soil. But many of them represent the echoes of ther-
monuclear airbursts from the Cold War, finding their

way into our water supply and meals. If they happen to
disintegrate within your DNA, they can damage your
genes. And many of them are bound up in your teeth.
Unlike most of the atoms in your body, those embed-
ded in your strong, stable tooth enamel have been with
you ever since you ingested them through your umbili-
cal cord and your infant feeding. If you were born dur-
ing the early 1960s, you have more nuclear waste in
your teeth than if you were born later, when soils and
oceans had had time to bury radioactive atoms. In fact,
forensic scientists use the proportion of bomb carbon
in tooth enamel to determine the age of unidentified
human remains.
