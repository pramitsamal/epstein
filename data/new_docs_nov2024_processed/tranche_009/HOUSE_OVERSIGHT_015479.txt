Oxygen: Your leafy breath

The oxygen in your lungs and bloodstream 1s a highly
reactive waste product generated by vegetation and
microbes. Trees, herbs, algae, and blue-green bacte-
ria split oxygen atoms out of water molecules during
photosynthesis. They use most of the resultant gas for
their own purposes, but thankfully some leaks out to
sustain you. In fact it makes up about a fifth of the
air you breathe. Your cells harness oxygen to release
energy from chemical bonds 1n the food you consume.

TEXT SETS

Oxygen absorbs electrons released by broken food
molecules, which attract hydrogen ions, resulting in
a molecular waste of your own making: metabolic
water, which comprises one tenth of your body fluids.
An average adult carries between 8 and 10 pounds of
homemade wastewater within them, and 1 in 10 of your
tears are the metabolic by-products of your breathing
and eating.
