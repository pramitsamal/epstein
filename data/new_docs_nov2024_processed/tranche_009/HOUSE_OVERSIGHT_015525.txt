Morality Games 313

development of sexual selection theory, one might have argued that perfect spheres
are some kind of Platonic solid, and inherently desirable, or that curvy hips yield
golden ratios. But with our current understanding of sexual selection, we recognize
that our sense of beauty has evolved and that there is no platonic sense of beauty
outside of that shaped by sexual selection. Any argument about perfect spheres is
unparsimonious and likely flawed. Without the help of evolution and game theory,
did philosophers conjure the moral equivalents of perfect spheres and golden ratios?
The state of nature, the orderly designer, Platonic ideals, autonomy, and humanity,
etc.—perhaps these arguments are also unfounded and unnecessary.
