x Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

Mathematical Bridge, Cambridge

Every autumn about thirty graduate students arrive at the
Engineering Department in Cambridge to join the Advanced Course in
Design, Manufacturing and Management. They expect to spend the year
walking among the city’s hallowed spires, attending lectures, bumping
into Stephen Hawking and punting on the River Cam.

Instead, they get quite a shock!

In 1989, I joined the course. There were twenty-six engineers, a
psychologist and a physicist — me. There was no prescribed syllabus;
instead the course used learning-by-experience and lectures from the
experts ina given field. To study advertising, you might visit a top London
agency, for shipbuilding a shipyard on the Clyde. If you were unlucky
enough to find these two lectures scheduled for the same week, you had
to travel the length of Britain. The course runs a half dozen minibuses
to solve this transport problem. Every four weeks we would undertake a
project in a different company. I remember designing pit props for coal
mines and imaging software for a weaving company. At the end of each
project we presented our findings to each other and, with eight projects
and thirty students, this made for a great many presentations. To keep
the process manageable, the course put great store in teaching us the art
of communication.

These days I design large complex systems, and clear communication
is extremely important. My ideas are often turned into working products
and, if those products have flaws, a post-mortem usually shows the cause
