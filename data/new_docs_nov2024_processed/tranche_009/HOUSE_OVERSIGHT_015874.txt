Hunter with Spears

Provided there are an infinite number of hunters there is always someone
to hand the spear to and the person at the front of the line now has space
for another spear.

You can probably see how to answer Dermot’s question. The hotel
manager calls the guest in the first room and asks him to move 3 rooms
up rather than one. He then calls the remaining guests and tells them
the same thing. Thus, he has managed to fit three more people into
the infinite hotel. Infinity plus 3 is infinity. You may worry that it takes
the manager an infinite time to call all the rooms, but it’s OK; he lives
infinitely long so it all works out.

What about fitting an infinite number of new guests into the already
full hotel? Surely then we will get stuck.

No, Hilbert’s Hotel can fit an infinite number of extra guests. Here’s
the trick: ask all the people currently in the hotel to move to the room
with double the number they are currently in — 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4,
3 goes to 6, and so on. Now all the odd numbers are empty and you can
fit an infinite number of people into the empty odd rooms. Infinity plus
infinity is infinity. Voila.
