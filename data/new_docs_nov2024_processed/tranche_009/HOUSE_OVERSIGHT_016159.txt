Private sector participation and investment will be crucial...

Whilst the government has earmarked cUS$2bn for the expansion of FTTH and wireless
infrastructure (with a view to ultimately increasing internet usage), we believe this will
likely be insufficient to meet the needs of the NTP’s ambitious targets (based on costs
of rolling out existing wireless and FTTH networks). As such, we believe the private
sector (Zain KSA, Mobily and STC) will be key contributors to the financing of the
expansion plan.

..intensifying the case for creation of a Saudi tower company

The Saudi telecom service providers have invested heavily in rolling out high speed
wireless networks and, in the case of Mobily and STC, FTTH networks (not to mention
license costs). This has seen the balance sheets of both Mobily and Zain KSA reaching
relatively high gearing levels; thereby limiting their ability to step up capital expenditure
for a sustained period. Consequently, we believe the focus on raising capital (to fund the
expansion programmes) from the spin out of their Tower portfolios will only increase.
We see Zain KSA as the key beneficiary of this given they have the most highly geared
balance sheet amongst Saudi Telco peers.

Mobile market share gains for Zain KSA and Mobily increasingly important

Whilst the Saudi government has taken steps to introduce competition in the
telecommunications industry, its moves to open the market have thus fallen short of
this objective. Specifically, government-owned STC retains more than 60% revenue
market share in Saudi Arabia, giving it a dominant position in the market, whilst Mobily
and Zain KSA have only managed to achieve c25% and 15% revenue market share
respectively.

This, in our view, has likely been driven by a number of factors including: (1) the
relatively high cost of market entry (ie licenses) for both Mobily and Zain KSA, which has
lumbered both with high operating costs; (2) high royalty costs, which amount to c16%
of revenues generated in Saudi Arabia (with some exceptions, including data), arguably
inhibiting requisite marketing and infrastructure spend. We note both Mobily and Zain
KSA remain loss making; and, (3) the relatively high mobile termination rates, which
arguably afford an advantage to STC and prevent Zain or Mobily from competing more
aggressively on price.

For the realisation of the NTP, we believe it is important that all private sector players
are realising sufficient rates of return and FCF generation to be able to finance the

requisite growth in infrastructure. We note both Mobily and Zain KSA were loss making
in 2015 and are expected to return sub 5% ROE’s in both 2016 and 2017 (according to
