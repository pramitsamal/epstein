Rationalization of subsidies for water and electricity

The sweeping energy, water and electricity administered price changes introduced in
December 2015 are a first step in the five-year fiscal consolidation and economic
transformation strategy. We expect further reviews of energy, water, and electricity
prices over the medium-term. Furthermore, the likely government review of current
levels of fees and fines, introduction of new fees, application of a VAT and introduction
of excise taxes on tobacco and soft drinks will also impact the Saudi consumer.

Subsidy cuts on energy and utilities to add up to 1.5ppt to CPI inflation only

We estimate the December natural gas price hike on petrochemical firms, domestic
crude oil price hike as well as the combined gasoline and diesel price hike introduced
could add USS2.2bn, US$2.0bn and USS$3.8bn to central government revenues if fully
passed to the budget (a combined 1.2% of GDP). We estimate the direct impact of these
higher gasoline, water and electricity prices to add 1.3-1.5ppt to CPI inflation due to
their low basket weights (c.1.5%, cO.4% and 1.6% respectively). We think a 5% VAT tax
could add c2% of 2015 GDP in fiscal revenues over the medium-term.

Subsidies account for 15% of Almarai’s net income; 40% are related to poultry
Almarai continues to receive subsidies from the Saudi government, amounting to
SAR295mn in 2015. This represents 15% of the Almarai’s 2015 net income. The
government pays subsidies based on price of subsidized feed importer, which means it
may increase or decrease naturally. Regarding the breakdown by business (poultry,
dairy), it is unfixed, depending on the price of feed and ingredients. As of 2015,
subsidies for poultry accounted for 40% and dairy for 60%.
