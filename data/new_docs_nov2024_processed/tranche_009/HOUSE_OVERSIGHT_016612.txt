MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

C. Case # 08-2471, 240 Park Avenue, Park Avenue Palm Beach LLC
Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86, of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, properties are required to be maintained in good condition and
unsightly, unsafe or unsanitary conditions are not permitted and Chapter 42,
Section 42-87, all exterior walls to be maintained in good repair and interior walls
and ceilings shall be structurally sound.

Lead Code Officer Walton advised this property had been found in non-
compliance at the last hearing, assessed administrative costs in the amount of
$150.00 and given one (1) day to comply. Compliance has not been achieved so
the Town recommends a $250.00 a day fine. He said he has met with the Chief
Financial Officer of the corporation that owns the property and that individual was
present today to address the Board.

Dan Gorman was sworn in by Recording Secretary Houston and said he had
become aware of this violation after the fact. He said they had been going back and
forth with the Town about what to do with the property at 240 Park Ave. He said
it was a disheveled rooming house when they took it over and they began to
rebuild it to its old glory. As recently as three weeks ago, an associate of his met
with the Town to discuss whether to continue to do the eighteen room
hotel/boarding house or convert

it into a single family residence. As a result of that, the original permits lapsed.
They then went to the Bahamas to work on another project and did not get the
notices. They have a new group of contractors, Principal Design and
Development Building, who are going to re-file the permits. He requested an
extension of time as they have done everything they can without permits. Mr.
Walton said the Town was requesting a fine of $250.00 a day to begin on March
22, 2008. In response to questions from Board members, Mr. Gorman said they
had decided to continue with the rooming house zoning and they had consultants
and financing in place. He anticipated the project, at least the exterior, would be
completed within 30 days and the interior portion, three to four months after that.

Mr. Hoffman advised he was not in favor of granting any extensions in this case
and Mr. Ochstein agreed.

MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO IMPOSE A FINE OF $250.00 A DAY,
COMMENCING ON MARCH 22, 2008 AND CONTINUING UNTIL

COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED.
