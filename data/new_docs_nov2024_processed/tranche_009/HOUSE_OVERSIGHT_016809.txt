Introduction: On the Promise and Peril of AI
by John Brockman

Seth Lloyd: Wrong, but More Relevant Than Ever
It is exactly in the extension of the cybernetic idea to human beings that Wiener’s
conceptions missed their target.

Judea Pearl: The Limitations of Opaque Learning Machines

Deep learning has its own dynamics, it does its own repair and its own optimization, and
it gives you the right results most of the time. But when it doesn’t, you don’t have a clue
about what went wrong and what should be fixed.

Stuart Russell: The Purpose Put Into the Machine

We may face the prospect of superintelligent machines—their actions by definition
unpredictable by us and their imperfectly specified objectives conflicting with our own—
whose motivation to preserve their existence in order to achieve those objectives may be
insuperable.

George Dyson: The Third Law

Any system simple enough to be understandable will not be complicated enough to
behave intelligently, while any system complicated enough to behave intelligently will be
too complicated to understand.

Daniel C. Dennett: What Can We Do?
We don’t need artificial conscious agents. We need intelligent tools.

Rodney Brooks: The Inhuman Mess Our Machines Have Gotten Us Into
We are ina much more complex situation today than Wiener foresaw, and I am worried
that it is much more pernicious than even his worst imagined fears.

Frank Wilczek: The Unity of Intelligence

The advantages of artificial over natural intelligence appear permanent, while the
advantages of natural over artificial intelligence, though substantial at present, appear
transient.

Max Tegmark: Let’s Aspire to More Than Making Ourselves Obsolete
We should analyze what could go wrong with AI to ensure that it goes right.

Jaan Tallinn: Dissident Messages

Continued progress in AI can precipitate a change of cosmic proportions—a runaway
process that will likely kill everyone.
