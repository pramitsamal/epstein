I tried to live my life based on principles and consistency. There were not always
understood by those who disagreed with where my principles sometimes took me and who
they led me to represent. That is why I have made it a policy to correct the record. I
admit that I have always tried to get the last word. Hence this posthumous letter to the
editor which I promise is my last word.

I hope this posthumous letter to the editor isn’t published for a while, but I suspect it will be
relevant whenever my obituary appears. That’s ok—as long as I get the last word!
