Years later, after Anatoly, now Natan, became a leading political figure in Israel, we were both
invited to speak at the celebration of Israel’s 60 birthday. Many world leaders were also invited.
One of the events was held in the Inbal Hotel in Jerusalem.

I got into the elevator and by coincidence both Mikael Gorbachov and Sharansky got into the
same elevator. Gorbachov recognized us (I had met him in Moscow during one of my human
rights trips while he was the Chairman of the Communist Party and the head of state). He pointed
at me and said to Sharanksy: “He’s a good lawyer, but I’m an even better lawyer.” Sharansky
replied, “But he got me out of the Soviet prison.” Gorbachov smiled and said “I got you out. He
helped, but without me you would have sat longer.” We all got a good laugh and shook hands.
