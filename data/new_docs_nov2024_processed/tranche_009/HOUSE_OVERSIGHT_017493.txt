Q. When you were hiring and bringing in all
these new attorneys, did everyone come in as a
partner?

A. No.

Q. How did you decide who came in as a partner
and who came in as an associate?

A. Depended upon their level of expertise,
practice, book of business. It was a decision Stuart
and } made together on a case-by-case basis.

Q. So you and Stu where the -- were in charge
of hiring?

A. Stuart and | tried to consult on every
hiring decision, yes.

Q. Did you guys also decide salaries?

A. 1] generally decided the salary and then let
Stu know what |] was going to do. And he would say if
he thought it was okay or if he thought it was too
much or too little, but ] generally had free reign in
that regard.

Q. Did someone's book of business directly
correlate to the salary that you would offer?

A. That is a very broad question because it
depends upon what other needs we had for that
individual.

Q. What do you mean by what other needs?

A. Well, I'll give you a good example. My
lawyer, Mr. Nurik, his salary was directly related to
the fact that he was a great lawyer and had a solid
book of business.

Q. Yes.

A. David Boden, on the other hand, was, as J
previously testified, ] don't know if you've had a
chance to read the testimony, but David Boden was not
only the general counsel to the law firm but he was
also -- acted as my consigliere in a significant
number of illegal operations and he was compensated
significantly for that, if that helps you understand
the difference.

Q. It does.

So, for example, when you were hiring former
judges, let's use that as an example, Pedro and Julio,
clearly they don't have a book of business coming in
because they haven't had clients, but they may carry
some sort of prestige or give some legitimacy, if you
will, to the firm. How would you decide the salary
for someone like that?

A. Stuand! would discuss it. It was more a
market issue than anything else, how much are judges
coming off the bench getting, how much business do we
think they can generate.

Q. Would you need to look at someone's book of
business if they were coming in just solely to be a
rainmaker for the firm prior to hiring them?

A. | discussed it with them. There were not
many people that ] recall that ] actually looked at
their numbers. Once David Boden was working for me ]
had him check people's numbers, but I rarely looked. J
took most people's words for what they were
generating.

Q. My recollection is, you were always looking
to bring in more people, to hire more people, some of
us were somehow able to resist you while others were
not. _How would you decide who you were looking at to
bring into your firm?

A. We were trying to develop, on the legitimate

side of the Jaw firm, we were trying to develop real

talent, rea] practice s. I mean, Brad isa

perfect example, great Jawyer, got a great reputation,
You know, it was our hope that, you know, he was going
to be one of the people to actually in some ways

rescue the firm because he had a practice group that

could generate substantial income. You know, on the
legitimate side that's what we were trying to do, we

were trying to find the best and the brightest,

Q. Okay. With respect to bringing people that

prt know that?
A. Everyone in the tort world that J] had spoke
to spoke extremely highly of Brad, not only people |
already had working for me but other people that knew
+him. He was very -- came very highly recommended to

us.
“Q. Like who, for example?

A. We wanted him in there. We were trying to
develop a significant tort group and we thought that
he'd be a great part of it.

Q. Who besides Russ told you that about Brad?

A. It would have been other people in the tort
group. ] don't want to guess, Tonja, as to which
other people told me, but it was -- well more than
Russ.

Q. Was it people within --

A. Might have been people in politics that ]
talked to that knew him because we had significant
input at the gubernatorial level with regard to tort
reform and the like, and there were people there who
knew who Brad was. It was more than one person that
told us that.
