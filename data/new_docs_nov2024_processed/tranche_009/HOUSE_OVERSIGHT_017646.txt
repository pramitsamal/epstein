history even once in a twenty-page subcommittee report, in four pages of minutes of its discussions, or in twenty-six pages of
proposed amendments and accompanying Advisory Committee Notes. °° Perhaps the Advisory Committee took a different
approach than the CVRA's drafters because it did not consider their stated intentions.

If, on the other hand, the Advisory Committee was aware of the drafters’ intentions and declined to follow them, it is staking
out a rather unusual path. It is standard practice for the Advisory Committee, no less than courts, to look to legislative history in
crafting the Rules. 8? With respect to the CVRA in particular, many courts have found the CVRA's legislative history highly
instructive. They have good reason for relying on the history. Unlike some contentious pieces of legislation where legislators
possessed divergent views, the CVRA enjoyed a broad, bi-partisan consensus. *° It passed by a vote of 393 to 14 in the
House °! and by a voice vote in the Senate. ?? Moreover, the CVRA's cosponsors were bipartisan, and the views they gave on
the legislation were not contradicted by anyone else. Thus, as the Ninth Circuit has explained in construing the CVRA to track
Senator Kyl's and Feinstein's views:

Floor statements by the sponsors of the legislation are given considerably more weight than floor statements by other members,
and they are given even more weight where, as here, other legislators did not offer any contrary views. Silence, the maxim
goes, connotes assent, and so we can draw from the fact that no one registered disagreement with Senators Kyl and Feinstein on
this point the reasonable inference that the views they expressed reflected a consensus, at least in the Senate. 7?

In light of all this, it is beyond doubt that crime victims have a substantive right to be treated with fairness (as well as with
respect for their dignity and [*877] privacy) in the federal criminal justice process. Once that right is in mind, the Advisory
Committee has clear duties under the Rules Enabling Act. That Act provides that the Rules shall not abridge, enlarge or
modify any substantive right. °4 Therefore, if any existing rule of criminal procedure abridges or even modifies a victim's
rights to fairness, it is invalid and must be changed. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee must review all the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure to ensure that they protect victims’ right to fairness.

B. The Advisory Committee Treats the Right to Fairness Inconsistently

The Advisory Committee claimed that to implement the right to fairness would use the right as a springboard for a variety of
victim rights not otherwise provided for in the CVRA. * If so, the Advisory Committee was unable to consistently follow its
own view. The Advisory Committee agreed with my proposed change to Rule 18; that change required that when a court
determines where within a judicial district to hold a trial, it should consider not only the convenience of the defendant and the
