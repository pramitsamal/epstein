community. 37? The provision is designed to secure a trial within the same political community (the state) in which the
373

victim would likely reside.
The Supreme Court's decisions on right of public access to trials bolsters the understanding of the Article II's provision to
protect the community interest. In cases such as Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, the Court has held that implicit in the
First Amendment is a guarantee of the public's right to attend trials. 3”4 Compelling victims’ interests underlie this guarantee.
As the Court has explained, public proceedings vindicate the concerns of the victims and the community in knowing that
offenders are being brought to account for their criminal conduct. 37> And as Justice Blackmun has emphasized, The victim
of the crime, the family of the victim, [and] others who have suffered similarly, ... . have an interest in observing the course of
a prosecution. 37° Victims are vitally interested in observing criminal trials because society has withdrawn both from the
victim and the vigilante the enforcement of criminal laws, but [it] cannot erase from people's consciousness the fundamental,
natural yearning to see justice done - or even the urge for retribution. 377

For purposes of this Article, it is not necessary to definitively trace how victims' constitutional interests play out against a
defendant's right to avoid a prejudicial trial. The very limited point here is merely that victims should be heard on any transfer,
so that a judge can make a fully informed decision. Even if the judge determines to transfer a case, the victim may have
valuable information for the judge on where to transfer the case (for example, to an adjacent district or state [*926] rather than

a distant one) or how to impanel an unbiased jury (for example, importing a jury rather than exporting the trial). 376

An illustration of the general approach of the proposed rule comes from the leading case of State v. Timmendequas, 37?

decided by the New Jersey Supreme Court. In Timmendequas, the trial judge imported a jury from a distant community to hear
a capital case rather than forcing the family of a murdered young girl to travel to another district. 78° Construing New Jersey
state law provisions similar to the CVRA's, the New Jersey Supreme Court explained that the trial judge properly considered
the views of the victim's family:

Over the past decade, both nationwide and in New Jersey, a significant amount of legislation has been passed implementing
increased levels of protection for victims of crime. Specifically, in New Jersey, the Legislature enacted the Crime Victim's Bill
of Rights. That amendment marked the culmination of the Legislature's efforts to increase the participation of crime victims in
the criminal justice system.

The purpose of the Victim's Rights Amendment was to enhance and protect the necessary role of crime victims and witnesses
in the criminal justice process. In furtherance of [that goal], the improved treatment of these persons should be assured through
the establishment of specific rights. One of the enumerated rights guaranteed for victims is to have inconveniences associated
with participation in the criminal justice process mmimized to the fullest extent possible.
