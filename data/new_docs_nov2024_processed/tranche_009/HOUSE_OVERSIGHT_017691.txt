both approved broadening that rule to give all victims the right to speak. “87 (The Judicial Conference withdrew this proposed
rule to allow reconsideration in light of the CVRA.) The CVRA gave victims the right to be reasonably heard at sentencing.
Of course, the CVRA's obvious goal was to significantly expand the rights of crime victims. With respect to the right to speak
in particular, one of the CVRA's primary sponsors stated: this section would fail in its intent if courts determined that written,
rather than oral communication, could generally satisfy this right. 43° Yet, in the wake of all this, the Advisory Committee
now proposes a rule that does not guarantee that victims have the right to speak, leaving this to the courts to construe on a case-
by-case basis. This retreat on victims’ rights truly stands the CVRA on its head.

The Advisory Committee should directly state that victims have the right to speak at sentencing, as the only courts to have
reached the issue have held. 43° For [*940] instance, in United States v. Kenna, Judge Kozinski ‘4° explained that the
CVRA's legislative history discloses a clear congressional intent to give crime victims the right to speak at proceedings
covered by the CVRA. “4! The court first highlighted the following statement by Senator Kyl:

It is not the intent of the term reasonably in the phrase to be reasonably heard to provide any excuse for denying a victim
the right to appear in person and directly address the court. Indeed, the very purpose of this section is to allow the victim to
appear personally and directly address the court. 47

Senator Dianne Feinstein, another primary sponsor of the bill, remarked that Senator Kyl's understanding of the bill was [her]
understanding as well. +43

In addition to these floor statements, the Kenna court cited a committee report for the proposed constitutional amendment to
protect victims' rights. The Senate Report on the amendment - an amendment that contained language nearly identical to the
language in the eventually enacted CVRA - reads that:

The victim's right is to be heard. The right to make an oral statement is conditioned on the victim's presence in the courtroom
.... Victims should always be given the power to determine the form of the statement. Simply because a decision making body,
such as the court ... has a prior statement of some sort on file does not mean that the victim should not again be offered the
opportunity to make a further statement ... . The Committee does not intend that the right to be heard be limited to written
statements, because the victim may wish to communicate in other appropriate ways. +44
