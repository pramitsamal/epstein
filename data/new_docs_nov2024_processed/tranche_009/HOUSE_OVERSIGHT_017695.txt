2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *945

In light of the statutory statement in /8 U.S.C. § 377/(d)(6) that nothing in the CVRA shall be construed to impair the
prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General, as well as the separation of powers issues raised by judicial review of the

government's decision to terminate a prosecution, the Subcommittee was not persuaded that the rule should be amended to
require the court to consider the victim's views on dismissal. When there is no public court proceeding, the victim's views will
be taken into account through the right to confer with the government under /8 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). 47!

The Advisory Committee's opening premise is clear enough - victims do indeed have great interest in whether charges are
dismissed. But after this promising start, the Committee's logic is hard to track. The Advisory Committee seems to be of the
view that, in situations where a court considers a motion to dismiss at a public proceeding, the victim would be heard. *7* Yet
the proposed Rule the Committee cites for this proposition - proposed Rule 60 +73 - is actually drafted so narrowly that the
victim would have no right to be heard on such a motion. 474

In situations where the court considered a motion to dismiss without a public proceeding, the Advisory Committee takes the
view that the CVRA does not explicitly address the subject. This view assumes, of course, that the victim's right to fairness
does not come into play when the prosecution moves to drop previously filed charges. This assumption is incorrect. Rule 48
already requires leave of court for a dismissal. In determining whether to grant leave, current case law requires the court to
consider whether dismissal is clearly contrary to manifest public interest. +7> The existing caselaw requires that the impact
on a victim be considered in addressing a motion to dismiss. A dismissal is clearly contrary to the public interest if the
prosecutor appears to be motivated by animus toward the victim. 47° Under the command of the CVRA, the victim thus must
be treated with fairness when the dismissal motion is addressed, as my proposal provides.

[*946] When the government files a motion to dismiss criminal charges involving a specific victim, the only way to protect
that victim's right to be treated fairly is to consider the victim's views on the dismissal. +77 To treat a person with fairness is
conventionally understood as treating them justly and equitably.. 478 A victim is not treated justly and equitably if her
views are never before the court.

The Advisory Committee also alludes vaguely to separation of powers issues raised by judicial review of the government's
decision to terminate a prosecution. Here the Advisory Committee may be stepping out of line and questioning the Supreme
Court. In 1944, the Court itself added the requirement to Rule 48 that prosecutors obtain leave of court before dismissing any
indictment. *7? Thus, if there are separation of powers issues about judicial review of dismissals, they have existed for more
than half a century by virtue of specific Supreme Court action.

without any substantive change, Rule 43.1 was renumbered as Rule 60.
