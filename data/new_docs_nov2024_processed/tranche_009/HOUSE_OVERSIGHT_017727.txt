2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *856

recite a specific proposed change followed by the rationale for that change as both a matter of law and of policy. For
convenience, this Article discusses the proposed changes sequentially, beginning with Rule 1.

Rule 1 - Definition of Victim
The Proposal:
Rule 1 should be amended to include the following definition of a victim:

Victim means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in the
District of Columbia. In the case of a crime victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the
legal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victim's estate, family members, or any other persons
appointed as [*857] suitable by the court, may assume the crime victim's rights under these rules, but in no event shall the
defendant be named as such guardian or representative.

The Rationale:

The CVRA directly defines victim using this language, !2° which ought to be folded into the rules for convenience. The
rules currently define such terms as attorney for the government, federal judge, and petty offense. !*! Victim should
likewise be defined.

A definition is required for a second reason: Rule 32 currently contains a differing definition of victim as an individual
against whom the defendant committed an offense for which the court will impose sentence. !2? Because that definition varies
from that mandated by the CVRA, it must be changed. Furthermore, the CVRA's definition comes with an interpretative
history. '?? The CVRA's definition of victim is taken almost verbatim from the 1996 Mandatory Victims Restitution Act
(MVRA). !?4 In tum, the MVRA drew on the 1982 Victim Witness Protection Act (VWPA). !?> As a result, the CVRA uses a
definition of victim that is more than twenty-two years old and that has not produced major administrative or definitional

problems. Courts will be able to draw from that history to determine who qualifies as a victim. 17°

conviction so that district court could not order restitution on basis of charges that were dropped as part of plea agreement); United States v.
Follet, 269 F.3d 996 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that a free clinic was not a victim of the defendant's rape of his niece); Moore v. United
States, 178 F.3d 994 (Sth Cir. 1999) (holding that a bank customer was victim of attempted bank robbery under MVRA where defendant
pointed a sawed-off shotgun at the customer and the teller, who were standing only two feet apart, while demanding money), cert. denied,
528 U.S. 943 (1999); United States v. Sanga, 967 F.2d 1332 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that foreign national who conspired to be brought into
United States illegally was still a victim of the conspiracy where her smuggler threatened her life and forced her to work as live-in maid
once she had arrived); United States v. Bedonie, 317 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (D. Utah 2004) (holding that victim in manslaughter case under
MVRA was murdered person himself and not the estate), rev'd on other grounds, United States v. Serawop, 410 F.3d 656 (10th Cir. 2005).

Act, 108 A.L.R. Fed. 828 (2005).

A few new issues will need to be litigated. For example, the Hughey case noted above conflicts with the views of Senator Jon Kyl, co-
sponsor of the CVRA, who explained that the definition of victim in the CVRA is an intentionally broad definition because all victims of
