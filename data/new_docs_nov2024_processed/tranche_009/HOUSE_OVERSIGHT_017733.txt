provide the judge with as much information as possible. The court is under no obligation to accept a plea proposed by the
155

parties. '°4 After hearing from the victim about the plea, the court can determine what weight to give to the victim's views.
To mplement the victim's right to be heard regarding a plea, the proposed rule change requires the court to directly address any
victim present in court. This is consistent with the CVRA's legislative history that explains that this provision is intended to
allow crime victims to directly address the court in person. !°° The language of the proposed rule is lifted from an earlier
paragraph in Rule 11, which requires the court to address the defendant personally in open court “before accepting a plea of
guilty. '°7 Victims should be treated even-handedly. It may be important for the judge to address victims directly because
many victims will lack the assistance of counsel. As novices in legal proceedings, victims may be uncertain about exactly when
in the process they should present their views. By addressing victims, the court will eliminate that uncertainty and ensure that
the victim's right to be heard is vindicated.

Rule 11(c)(1) - Prosecution To Consider Victims' Views on Pleas

The Proposal:

The prosecution should be required to consider the victims' views in developing any proposed plea arrangement as follows:

(1) In General. An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may
discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. The attorney for the government shall
make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider the victims’ views about, any proposed plea negotiations. If
the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, the plea agreement may
specify that an attorney for the government will ... .

The Rationale:

The proposed change requires prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify victims about possible plea bargains and to
consider the victim's views regarding those pleas. This requirement is taken essentially verbatim from the Attorney General
Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance, which direct prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims

153 See, e.g., Conn. Const. art. 1, 8 (giving victim right to be heard and to object to plea agreement); Mo. Const. art. 1, 32 (giving victim right
to be heard at plea hearing); Utah Const. art. I, 28(1)(b) (giving victim the right to be heard at important criminal justice hearings related to
the victim); Ala. Code 15-23-71 (2000) (giving victim right to be present at plea hearing and requiring prosecutor to confer with victim

about plea); Ariz. Rev. Stat. 13-4423 (2001) (giving victim right to be present and heard at plea hearing and requiring prosecutor to confer
with victim about plea); Afinn. Stat. Ann. 6114.03 (West 2003) (giving victim right to be heard at plea hearing); Miss. Code Ann. 99-43-33
(2000) (giving victim right to make statement at plea hearing); N.H. Rev. Stat. 2]-M:8-k (2000) (giving victim right to be heard at plea
hearing); R.I. Stat. 12-28-4.1 (2000) (giving victim right to make statement at plea hearing). See generally Beloof, Cassell & Twist, supra
note 15, at 476-94 (discussing victims and pleas); Sarah N. Welling, Victim Participation in Plea Bargains, 65 Wash. U. L.Q. 301 (1987).
