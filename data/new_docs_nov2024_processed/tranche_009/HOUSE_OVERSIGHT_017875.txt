Court declines to adopt this standard.
There was no question that, at a minimum,
the defendants in these products liability
actions had substantial contacts with the
forum, in these cases being New York, and
were involved in the sale or production of
the products at issue. In re DES Cases,
789 F.Supp. at 559; Simon, 86 F.Supp.2d
at 99-100. Here, however, there are ques-
tions as to the Defendants’ contacts with
the forum, whether it be the United States
generally or New York specifically, and
the Defendants’ alleged involvement with
al Qaeda is much more attenuated.

B. Due Process Requirements

[46-49] Any exercise of personal juris-
diction must comport with the require-
ments of due process. “The due process
test for personal jurisdiction has two relat-
ed components: the ‘minimum contacts’
inquiry and the ‘reasonableness’ inquiry.”
Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson—Ceco
Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 567 (2d Cir.1996). De-
pending on the basis for personal jurisdic-
tion, due process under either the Fifth or
Fourteenth Amendment applies. “[TJhe
due process analysis is basically the same
under both the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments. The principal difference is
that under the Fifth Amendment the court
can consider the defendant’s contacts
throughout the United States, while under
the Fourteenth Amendment only the con-
tacts with the forum state may be consid-
ered.” Chew v. Dietrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28
n. 4 (2d Cir.1998). Here, personal jurisdic-
tion under the New York long-arm statute
requires minimum contacts with New York
pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.
The exercise of personal jurisdiction under
Rule 4(k) requires contacts with the Unit-
ed States as a whole pursuant to the Fifth
Amendment.

1. Minimum Contacts

[50,51] Minimum contacts are re-
quired so “that the maintenance of the suit

does not offend traditional notions of fair
play and substantial justice.” Intl Shoe
Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66
S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945); see also
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Wood-
son, 444 U.S. 286, 292, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62
L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). The minimum con-
tacts requirement is also known as “fair
warning,” such that the defendant’s con-
tacts with the forum should be sufficient
to make it reasonable to be haled into
court there. Burger King, 471 U.S. at
474, 105 S.Ct. 2174. The “ ‘fair warning’
requirement is satisfied if the defendant
has ‘purposefully directed’ his activities at
the residents of the forum ... and the
litigation results from alleged injuries that
‘arise out of or relate to’ those activities.”
Id. (internal citations omitted); see also
World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 297-
98, 100 S.Ct. 559 (finding purposefully di-
rected activities where defendant delivered
products into stream of commerce with ex-
pectation they would be purchased by resi-
dents of forum); Calder, 465 U.S. at 789-
90, 104 S.Ct. 1482 (finding publishing ac-
tivities outside of forum were calculated to
cause injury to plaintiff in forum where
she lived and which also had the highest
subscription rate). “Although it has been
argued that foreseeability of causing wu-
ry in another State should be sufficient to
establish such contacts there when policy
considerations so require, the Court has
consistently held that this kind of foresee-
ability is not a ‘sufficient benchmark’ for
exercising personal jurisdiction.” Burger
King, 471 US. at 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174
(quoting World-Wide Volkswagen, 444
U.S. at 295, 100 S.Ct. 559). In every case,
there must be “some act by which the
defendant purposefully avails itself of the
privilege of conducting activities within the
forum State, thus invoking the benefits
and protections of its laws.” Jd. (quoting
