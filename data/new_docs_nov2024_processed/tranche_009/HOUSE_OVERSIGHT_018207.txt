rather than later so that the parties can move toward a mutually acceptable
conclusion.

Washington must also keep in mind that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
has the last word on all matters in Iran, and that negotiations will go only
as far as he allows them to go. In years past, he issued a fatwa condemning
nuclear weapons -- Washington could take advantage of this fact by
drafting a UN Security Council resolution endorsing the fatwa. This could
be a small step toward boosting Khamenet's international profile while
simultaneously pressuring Iran to follow its own religious decree.

To be sure, regime change remains an attractive alternative on paper, and
some in Washington view it as an insurance policy. Historically, however,
regime change has not been a successful option for the United States, and
internal attempts at toppling Iran's leadership have thus far been crushed
by Stalinesque suppression, including the 2009 uprising. Despite such
failures and Washington's limited influence in Iranian domestic affairs,
U.S. policy should be to demonstratively support popular democratic
movements.
