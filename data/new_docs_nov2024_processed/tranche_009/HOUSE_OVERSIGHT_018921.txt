Polygraph shows he didn’t know girls’ ages, lawyer says

b> EPSTEIN from 1B

using the name “Pimpin’
Made EZ.” Robson, who was
not charged in the case, is a
potential prosecution wit-
ness.

According to Recarey,
prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek
offered Epstein attorneys
Dershowitz. and Guy Fronstin
a plea deal in April. Fronstin,
after speaking with Epstein,
accepted the deal, in which
Epstein would plead guilty to
one count of aggravated as-
sault with intent to commit a
felony, be placed on five
years’ probation and have no
criminal record. The deal al-
so called for Epstein to sub-
mit to a psychiatric and sex-
ual evaluation and have no
unsupervised visits with mi-
nors, according to Recarey’s
report. The plea bargain was
made in connection with only
one of the five alleged vic-
tims, the report states.

Fronstin — who declined
to comment on the case —
‘ was subsequently fired and
veteran defense attorney
Jack Goldberger was hired.
He denies there was any

agreement by any of Ep-
stein’s attorneys to a plea
deal.

“We absolutely did not
agree to a plea in this case,”
he said. Neither Belohlavek
nor a_ state attorney’s
spokesman could be reached
for comment.

The parent or parents of
alleged victims who com-

plained of being harassed by
private investigators provid-
ed license tag numbers of two
of the men. Police found the
vehicles were registered to a
private eye in West Palm
Beach and another in Jupiter,
according to Recarey’s re-
port.

“I have no knowledge of
it,” defense attorney Gold-
berger said.

The report also says a
woman connected to the Ep-
stein case was contacted by
somebody who was still in
touch with Epstein. That
person told her she would be
compensated if she didn’t
cooperate with police, Re
carey’s report says. Those
who did talk “will be dealt
with,” the woman said she
was told. Phone records
show the woman talked with
the person who allegedly in-
timidated her around the
time she said, Recarey re-
ported.

Phone records also show
that the person said to have
made the threat then placed a
call to Epstein’s personal as-
sistant, who in turn called a
New York corporation affili-
ated with Epstein, the report
states.

The issue in the Epstein
case is not whether females
came to his waterfront home,
but whether he knew their
ages.

“He’s never denied girls
came to the house,” Gold-
berger said. But when Ep-
stein was given a polygraph

test, “he passed on knowl
edge of age,” the attorney
said.

After the indictment
against Epstein was unsealed
this week, Police Chief Reiter
referred the matter to the
FBI. “We've received the re-
ferral, and we're reviewing
it,” said FBI spokeswoman
Judy Orihuela in Miami.

The chief himself has
come under attack from Ep-
stein’s lawyers and friends in
New York, where he has a
home. The New York Post
quoted Epstein’s prominent
New York lawyer, Gerald
Lefcourt, as saying his client
was indicted only “because of
the craziness of the police
chief,”

Reiter has declined to
comment on the case. ,

Prosecutors have not
presented a sex-related case
like Epstein’s to a grand jury
before, said Mike Edmond-
son, spokesman for the state
attorney’s office. “That’s what
you do with a case that falls
into a gray area,” he said.

The state attorney’s office
did not recommend a partic-
ular criminal charge on

_ which to indict Epstein, Ed-

mondson said. The grand ju-
ry was presented with a list of
charges from highest to low-
est, then deliberated with the
prosecutor out of the room,
he said.

“People are surprised at
the grand jury proceeding,”
West Palm Beach defense
attorney Richard Tendler

said. “It’s a way for the pros-
ecutor’s office to not take the
full responsibility for not fil-
ing the (charge), and not do-
ing what the Palm Beach Po-
lice Department wanted. I
think something fell- apart
with those underage wit-
nesses.”

Defense attorney Robert
Gershman was a prosecutor
for six years. “Those girls
must have been incredible or
untrustworthy, I don’t know,”
he said.

Other attorneys said Ep-
stein’s case raises the issue of
whether wealthy, connected
defendants like Epstein —
whose friends include former
President Clinton and
Donald Trump — are treated
differently from others. Once
he knew he was the subject of
a criminal probe, Epstein
hired a phalanx of powerful
attorneys such as Dershowitz
and Lefcourt, who is a past
president of the National As-
sociation of Criminal Defense
Lawyers.

Miami lawyer Roy Black
— who became nationally
known when he successfully
defended William Kennedy
Smith on a rape charge in
Palm Beach — also was in-
volved at-one point.

Said defense attorney
Michelle Suskauer: “I think
it’s unfortunate the public
may get the perception that
with power, you may be
treated differently than the
average Joe.”
