A Grand Jury Session was requested during the month of February 2006,
in which all the girls that had been interviewed would have been
called to testify before the Grand Jury to seek an indictment against
Jeffrey Epstein. Due to subsequent meetings with the State Attorney's
Office and Defense Attorney Alan Dershowitz the Grand Jury was
postponed until a later time. Dershowitz had provided a package of
material on the main victims in this case in which they appear on
myspace.com and speak about alcohol use and some marijuana use. The
State Attorney's Office wanted time to review the material.

I requested additional subpoenas from the State Attorney's Office in
which I requested information from Dollar Rent a Car and Jet Aviation.
The information requested from Dollar Rent a Car was for the rented
vehicle by Alfredo Rodriguez while under the employ of Epstein for one
of the victims. The other subpoena requested was for Jet Aviation for
dates and times when Epstein's planes were in Palm Beach County.

I continued to research other names that were acquired either from
interviews or intelligence gathered during the investigation. I
