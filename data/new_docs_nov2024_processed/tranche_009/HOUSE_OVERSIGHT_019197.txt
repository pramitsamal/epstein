appears to have gone through the house, gotten rid of incrimi-
nating materials, but left many clues behind.

It was as if the things the police were seeing didn’t even reg-
ister as wrong.

There’s another feeling the cops can’t shake: the nagging sense
that they themselves are being investigated and tailed.

First Reiter hears through the grapevine that Epstein’s law-
yers have hired private investigators to perform background
checks.

A public-records demand has been filed in an effort to obtain
Reiter’s own records.

Detective Recarey tells Reiter that he, too, is being surveilled
and that his trash has been picked through.

In his entire career as a police officer, this is the first time
that Reiter’s seen or heard of such a thing: a suspect investigat-
ing his investigators. But for the moment, he puts it aside. Recar-
ey’s doing great work on the investigation. He’s deeply invested,
and for good reason: the detective’s got four kids of his own.
Right now, more victims are coming out of the woodwork. And
now that the warrant’s been executed, there’s no downside to
interviewing Epstein’s servants.
