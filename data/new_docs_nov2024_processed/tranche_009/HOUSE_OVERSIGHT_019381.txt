By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Attormneys.and publicists for
Palm Beach financier Jeffrey
Epstein went on the offensive
Monday, contending that
teenage girls who have ac

cused Epstein of sexual she-

nanigans at his waterfront
home are liars and saying that
the Palm Beach Police De-
partment is “childish.”

“There never was any sex

between Jeffrey Epstein and

Jack Gold-
berger, said
from Idaho
where he was
vacationing
with his fami-
ly.

Epstein did have young
women come to his house to
give him massages, Goldberg-
er said. “Mr. Epstein absolute-

JACK GOLDBERGER,

ly insisted anybody who came
to his house be over the age of
18. How he verified that, Idon’t
know. The question is, did
anything egal occur. The law
was not violated here,”

He had no explanation as to
why Epstein would pay girls or
women with no massage train-
ing -— as the alleged victims
said was the case — $200 to
$300 for their visits. “The
credibility of these witnesses
has been seriously ques-

Epstein’s lead atiomey

—

tioned,” Goldberger said.

Epstein, 53, was indicted
by a county grand jury last
month on a charge of felony
solicitation of prostitution. Af
ter an 11-month investigation
that included sifting through
Epstein’s trash and surveilling
his home, Palm Beach police
concluded there was enough
evidence to charge him with
sexual activity with minors.
When the grand jury indicted
Epstein on the less serious

charge, Police Chief Michael
Reiter referred the case to the
FBI to determine whether

there were federal law viola- -

tions.

After a spate of stories ©
about the case last week, New -

York publicist Dan Kiores —
whose client list has included
Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lopez
— said on Saturday that Ep-

stein’s camp was ready “to get .

their story out.”
