CHAPTER 11
Enter Assange

Thanks to Russia (and thanks to WikiLeaks), Snowden remains
free.

—JULIAN ASSANGE, Newsweek, 2015

ULIAN ASSANGE had made a brilliant career of trafficking in

state, military, and corporate secrets. Born on July 3, 1971, in
Queensland, Australia, Assange began his hacking career while still
a teenager. Using the alias Mendax (“the untruthful one”), he had
hacked into the computers of the Pentagon, the U.S. Navy, NASA,
Citibank, Lockheed Martin, and Australia’s Overseas Telecommuni-
cations Commission before he was twenty. At the age of twenty-five,
he pleaded guilty to twenty-five charges of hacking in Australia but
was released on a good behavior bond. In 2006, with the spread of
Tor software, he co-founded WikiLeaks, a website in which secret
documents could be anonymously sent and posted. The site received
little public attention until Bradley Manning sent it several hun-
dred thousand lowly classified U.S. military and State Department
documents in April 2010. With these stolen documents, WikiLeaks
became a media sensation, and Assange, the runner-up for Time’s
Man of the Year for 2010, became a leading figure, along with Appel-
baum, in the global hacktivist underground.
