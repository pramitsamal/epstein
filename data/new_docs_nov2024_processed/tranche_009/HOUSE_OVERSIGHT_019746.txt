CHAPTER 25
Through the Looking Glass

There’s definitely a deep state. Trust me, I’ve been there.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2014

Wa WAITING to hear back from Kucherena’s office, I
arranged to meet with Victor Cherkashin, who had been one
of the most successful KGB spy handlers in the Cold War. Cher-
kashin, born in 1932, had served in the KGB’s espionage branch
from 1952 until 1991 and now operated a private security firm in
Moscow. I was particularly interested in his recruitment of three
top American intelligence officers: Aldrich Ames of the CIA, Robert
Hanssen of the FBI, and Ronald Pelton of the NSA. I hoped that see-
ing these intelligence coups through the eyes, and mind-set, of their
KGB handler might provide some historical context for the Snowden
defection. So I invited Cherkashin to lunch at Gusto, a quiet Italian
restaurant, located near the Chekhov Theater in Moscow.

Cherkashin, a tall thin man with silver hair, showed up promptly
at 1:00 p.m., wearing an elegant gray suit and dark tie. He walked
with a spry step. Because he had served in counterintelligence in the
Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., for nearly a decade, he spoke
flawless English.
