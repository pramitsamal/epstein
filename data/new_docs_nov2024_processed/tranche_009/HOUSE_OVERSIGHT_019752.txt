264 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS

ton, D.C., to Austria so that its specialists could debrief him on the
secrets he held in his head, it would have an even greater interest in
exfiltrating Snowden from Hong Kong to get, aside from his docu-
ments, whatever secrets he held in his head. If Russian intelligence
were willing to opportunistically accept the delivery of U.S. secrets
from an unknown espionage source that it neither recruited nor
controlled, such as Hanssen, it would obviously have little hesitancy
in acquiring the secrets that Snowden had stolen of his own volition,
even if Snowden had acted for idealistic reasons.

If Russian intelligence focused its search pattern on disgruntled
American intelligence workers, such as Ames, it is plausible that it
spotted Snowden through his Internet rants against U.S. surveil-
lance. Even if it had missed Snowden in Hawaii, a disgruntled former
civilian employee at the NSA would have received its full attention
after he contacted Russian officials in Hong Kong. While the tactics
of the SVR might have changed since Cherkashin retired, its objec-
tives remained the same. And the NSA remained its principal target.
Nor is there any reason to doubt that it still measures success in its

© ability to obtain, by whatever means, the secret sources and methods ®
of its adversaries. Snowden was in a position, with both the docu-
ments he had taken and the knowledge he had in his head, to deliver
the KGB such a coup.
