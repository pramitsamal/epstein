Chinese Race.”* Hong Kong has long been a base for flag-waving Chinese activists
agitating on the issue of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. “The Chinese race does not
fight wars. The Chinese race only safeguards peace!” runs one pronouncement which
was designed as an outreach to potential supporters on Okinawa. “The Chinese race
is relying on you. The Chinese race today relies on you, and the Chinese race can
rely on you.”° Even more extreme is the way that the group frames its assertion that
the Ryukus (Senkaku/Diaoyu) should become part of China. “The Japanese people
are a part of the Chinese race and Japan is originally of Chinese blood,” the group’s
president, Zhao Dong, says in one posting.

For the CCP in Beijing, with an eye on the long game, building links between
malcontents in Okinawa and patriots in Hong Kong could easily pay off in the future.

Countering Chinese Influence

The Japanese government has been at the forefront of attempts to counter Chinese
efforts for influence throughout Asia. It maintains a robust, if under-the-radar,
relationship with Taiwan. It has strong ties to Vietnam and it has attempted to
modify China’s influence over Cambodia and Laos, although to little effect. Japan
has a close relationship with New Delhi that involves not simply trade but also
security. Japan and India recently unveiled the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor as a
way to compete with Chinese influence in Africa. Japan’s ties to Australia are deep
as well.’ Japan’s government was the source of the expression “Free and open Indo-
Pacific” as a counterpoint to China’s attempts to turn the Western Pacific (or at least
the South China Sea) into a Chinese lake. Moreover, Japanese firms currently are
outpacing Chinese firms in terms of infrastructure investment in Southeast Asia.
