Consequences of Inaction — Investor Perspective

e Short Term, No Problem Yet

Global bond investors, in part, have looked past USA Inc.’s
deteriorating financials because growth, inflation, and Fed
purchases matter more, and because income statements and
balance sheets of many other developed countries (Such as
Greece / Spain / Portugal / Ireland) are worse.

e Long Term, Consequences of Inaction Could Be Severe

If USA Inc.’s “managers” and “board” continue to ignore rising
unfunded entitlement spending, investors could eventually demand
a higher return to lend money to USA Inc. — leading to rising bond
yields / higher borrowing costs for USA Inc. At some point, USA
Inc.’s currency could also weaken significantly.

Note: “Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the relationship between government debt and real GDP growth
is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. . We
note that while Reinhart and Rogoff's observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer to the European countries’ definition of government

gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10. Pps is percentage points. Source: {MF, Business Intelligence Monitor .
