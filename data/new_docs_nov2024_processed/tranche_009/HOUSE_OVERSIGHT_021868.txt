the clock or anything, but let's get this moving along
so we can get your questions answered.

Q. I just need to make my record on that.

SO we are going to put aside Virginia

Roberts.

A. Okay.

Q. And I'm not talking about attorneys here
talking about -- what I'm talking about is people who
could be witnesses, people who saw things, people did
things, heard things, people who have evidence that
would be admissible in court. Do you have that in mind?

A. Okay.

Q. As of December 30th, 2014, putting aside
Miss Roberts, as to whom you've refused to answer, had
anyone who fits that category of a person with personal
knowledge of admissible evidence told you that Alan
Dershowitz had abused any other minors?

MR. SCAROLA: I'm going to instruct you not
to answer that question on the basis of the
attorney/client and work product privileges.

MR. SIMPSON: The Knowledge -- let me ask
this way.

MR. SCAROLA: Let me explain. It might be
helpful to you if I were to explain the basis of

my objection.
