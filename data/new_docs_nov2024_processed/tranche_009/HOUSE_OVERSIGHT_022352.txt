To enhance the potential benefits consider funding a series of cascading GRATs - the
remainders can be added to the IDGT

If the cascading GRATs are successful, at the end of the cascading GRAT terms
additional assets can be sold to the IDGT

* AFRs are defined as: 1) short-term - not over three years; 2) mid-term - over three, but not over nine years; 3) long-term - over nine years.
** |f Grantor dies before note is satisfied, the fair market value of the note is includible in grantor’s estate.
