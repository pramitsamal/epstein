around-the-world honeymoon that Epstein had arranged
for her. Some are, or have been, his romantic interests.
His present girlfriend, whom he met four years ago at a
dinner party in New York, is in dental school. One
former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish
model and Miss Universe finalist whom Epstein has
known for more than thirty years, became a doctor—
Epstein sent her to medical school—and married hedge
funder Glen Dubin. Together they finance the Dubin
Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital. Most of the
women at one time will travel with Epstein to his other
floating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, a vast
apartment in Paris, the island in the Caribbean, the
house in Palm Beach.

Epstein will sometimes move a meeting in his
dining room outside to the park—his idea of going out
to lunch is a Sabrett’s hot dog—with the various girls in
the house the accompanying entourage, as though
something out of an 18th-century French court.

But the Hefnerian prurience can also be quite
businesslike: poised young women in a mansion on the
Upper East Side with various office responsibilities are
really not that different from any of the art galleries in
the surrounding neighborhood. They mingle freely with
his powerful guests, not so much as hostesses—or, in
tabloid language, harem-like “sex slaves”—but as
attentive students (which, of course, might be regarded
as having its own fetish-like attraction). Epstein
explicitly denies that there is an sexual quid pro quo.
