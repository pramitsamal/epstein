Palm Beach police were unhappy with the handling of the Epstein case by then-State
Attorney Barry Krischer.

June: The grand jury, after hearing from only one girl, returns an indictment of one
count of solicitation of prostitution. The charge does not reflect that the victim in
question and others were minors.

July: Epstein’s powerhouse legal team tries to negotiate a deal with the State
Attorney’s Office. Lawyers discuss a deferred prosecution in which Epstein would
enter a pretrial intervention program and serve no jail time.

July: After pressure from the Palm Beach police chief, the FBI opens a federal
investigation, dubbed “Operation Leap Year.” Documents list the possible crime as
“child prostitution.”

November: The FBI begins interviewing potential witnesses and victims from
Florida, New York and New Mexico.

2007

May: As the U.S. Attorney’s Office prepares to present the case to a federal grand
jury, Epstein’s attorneys request a meeting to discuss the investigation.

June: A 53-page indictment is prepared by the U.S. Attorney’s Office as,
simultaneously, plea negotiations are initiated with Epstein’s legal team.

July: Grand jury subpoenas are issued for Epstein’s computers, which were
apparently removed from his Palm Beach home prior to the police search.

August: The U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, enters into direct
discussions about the plea agreement; a motion to compel production of Epstein’s
computers is delayed.

September: Federal prosecutors draw up several federal plea agreements that are
rejected by Epstein and his attorneys. Epstein signs a non-prosecution agreement
on Sept. 24, but his attorneys continue to delay his court appearance.
