8g Teaching Minds

How can we offer new curricula and new ways of learning if no mat-
ter what we do children must pass algebra tests? Each administration
says over and over again that science is important, but since science
in high school is defined for the most part by boring tests of vocabu-
lary terms and definitions, who would be excited to learn science? If
a really good scientific reasoning curriculum were created, the schools
could not offer it unless it helped kids pass the very same tests that
that curriculum was intended to replace.

We must make radical change. The only way to do that is to stop
focusing on teaching subjects and stop using the fact-based tests are
the natural end result of that focus on subjects.

An education system based on cognitive processes would look
very different indeed.
