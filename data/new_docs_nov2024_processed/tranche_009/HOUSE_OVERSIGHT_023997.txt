Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok

Though it's just steps from Bangkok's best shopping malls (and the Starting Sunday
city's notorious traffic-thronged streets), the Siam Kempinski Hotel 31/7 at 8pm BST

Bangkok manages to provide a tranquil getaway that feels miles from

the city's chaos. Capitalizing on the hotel brand's European roots, the
design is an artful blend of Art Deco accents and Thai flourishes. In 303
rooms, huge beds, baths and work/lounge areas provide ample space to

recharge, while the amenities - a pool area, a spa and one of the city's
best restaurants - offer plenty of excuses to stay close to home.
