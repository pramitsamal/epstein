DEAL FLOW AND INVESTMENT PROCESS

The Fund Managers have a proactive approach to deal sourcing, which targets both private and
public opportunities. The established and proven sourcing activities rely on diverse networks
of deal sources that have been built and cultivated over two decades and focus on identifying
compelling healthcare technology investment opportunities, at attractive time points for
investment. These efforts balance the inherent attractiveness of an innovative technology with
the selection of the appropriate investment stage, offering an optimal risk-adjusted return
potential and multiple paths to realization and liquidity.

The Fund Managers have refined and successfully executed this investment process over many
years, and it is an integral part of the firm’s culture. New Leaf’s investment philosophy and
process emphasize a team approach to maximizing investment returns, focusing the most
appropriate resources within the firm to deal sourcing, rigorous investment analysis, deep
involvement with portfolio companies and active management of financings and exits.
