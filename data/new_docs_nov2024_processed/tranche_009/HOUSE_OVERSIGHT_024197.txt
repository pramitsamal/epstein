The most important energy developments of 2012: how countries are planning for Independence Day

Il; Is Germany making an impetuous mad dash into renewable energy?

In the wake of Fukushima, Chancellor Merkel announced a plan to accelerate the closure of coal and nuclear power plants, with
the goal of relying more on renewable energy to fill the gap. Germany is by far the largest user of electricity in Europe and its
manufacturing to GDP ratio is high, so the consequences may be substantial. To get a sense of the potential impact, start with
the first chart on Germany’s current generating capacity and output by source. While wind and solar installations have increased
in recent years, their electricity output is less impactful due to wind and solar intermittency.

The two largest increases in Germany’s renewable plan are offshore wind and photovoltaic (solar). Offshore wind connections
are very expensive; according to Netherlands-based transmission system operator TenneT, they work out to ~1.1 million Euros
per MW, and that’s just for the connection (not the wind turbine itself, that’s extra). That offshore wind connection cost is
even higher than the 0.8-1.0 million per MW upfront capital cost of building new natural gas plants, using data from RWE AG
(Essen) and SWB AG (Bremen). Wind is free and natural gas isn’t, so we should look at all-in levelized costs” by electricity
source. As shown in the second chart, all things considered, offshore wind is a very expensive way for Germany to generate
electricity, and solar is higher by another order of magnitude. The relative ordering is similar in other countries.

Germany is a very energy-efficient country, and has among the lowest electricity-to-GDP ratios in Europe. However, the cost of
electricity to industrial consumers is already among the highest in Europe when including taxes, and for residential
consumers, Germany is the highest. As a result, the proposed shift to renewable energy may further increase electricity prices
for both residential and commercial users. There’s not enough data yet to measure the impact so far.

Germany’s goal: raise the contribution of renewable energy from 20% to 35% by 2020, and to 80% of total consumption
by 2050. The total cost of financing this transition is estimated at 800 billion Euros by DIW Berlin. The first stage, from now
until 2020, is supposed to cost 200 billion Euros. At a time when commitments to save Spain and the rest of the Periphery are

> Levelized costs are all-in costs which include construction, financing costs, ongoing maintenance and operations and fuel inputs costs. In
Europe (unlike in the US), levelized cost numbers also include a carbon footprint estimate @ $30 per tonne of COz.
