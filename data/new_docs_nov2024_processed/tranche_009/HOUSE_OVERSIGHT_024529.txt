Long Term Incentive Plan

Our Adjusted EBITDA projections do not include the effect of any payments that may be made pursuant to
our Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan. Under this new plan, which provides performance-based
incentive compensation awards beginning in 2006 based on our performance against specific Adjusted
EBITDA targets, we will accrue expenses ranging from $2.6 million in 2006 to $15.2 million in 2011 if our
Adjusted EBITDA meets the projections set forth in this Memorandum. Each award is payable at the end
of three years based on performance and subject to continued employment (with certain exceptions).
The accrued expenses associated with an award in each period are non-cash, subject to cash settlement
when and if the award for that period is earned at the end of the third year. The actual expenses could be
higher or lower depending on whether actual Adjusted EBITDA performance exceeds or is less than the
amounts projected herein.

Working Capital

KLC OpCo does not expect revenue or expenses to have a meaningful impact on working capital ratios in
the future.
