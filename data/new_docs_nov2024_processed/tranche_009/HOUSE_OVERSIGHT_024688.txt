Vaporizers and Accessories

Smoking or vaporizing cannabis flower or concentrates is the most popular method of cannabis con-
sumption, in part because the effects of inhaled cannabis smoke or vapor begin almost immediately.
Accessories used to smoke cannabis include glass, wood or metal pipes; glass or plastic water pipes
known as “bongs”; and cigarette papers used to roll “joints.” A vaporizer is a device that heats cannabis
flower or concentrate to a temperature at which its active compounds boil and can be inhaled as vapor.
Vaporizers are increasing in popularity faster than any other cannabis-consumption device, in some
measure because vaporizing is perceived by many as a healthier method of cannabis consumption than
smoking. Distinguishing features of a vaporizer include whether it vaporizes flower or concentrate, the
form of the heating mechanism, or “atomizer,” power output, battery efficiency, durability, reusability
(there are both refillable and disposable vaporizers) and design aesthetics. Hundreds of vaporizers are
marketed, ranging from simple to complex, including handheld vaporizers that retail for $10 to $500
and. tabletop vaporizers that retail for $100 to more than $1,000.
