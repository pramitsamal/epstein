Nutraceuticals

Given robust consumer interest in CBD products, we estimate that over the next two
years, the nutraceuticals category (which includes tinctures, capsules, gummy vitamins,
etc.) can generate revenues of $2.4 bn. Uncertainty around the timing of this revenue
ramp reflects a lack of clarity on how quickly retailers, in particular mass market
retailers, will begin to stock the products following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill.

Our $2.4 bn estimate is benchmarked against the herbal supplement market in the U.S.
According to the American Botanical Council, herbal supplement retail sales were $6.4
bn in 2014, posting the 11 year of consecutive growth. Between 2004-2014, the
herbal supplement category grew its revenues at a ~4.2% CAGR. Extrapolating that
growth out to 2019 would imply a total herbal supplement market of ~$8 bn over the
next two years. Our $2.4 bn estimate for the CBD market would imply almost a 30%
share of this market by 2020. The importance of retail adoption is reflected in the
category makeup of the herbal supplement market, where we can see that over 17% of
sales come from mass market retailers.
