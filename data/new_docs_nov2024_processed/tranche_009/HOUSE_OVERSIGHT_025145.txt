returned (though of course not whatever HIV-resistant genes may have been selected

among the Africans).

Divergent human populations often show very similar patterns of strong selection for
genes though different in time--thus Europe and Yoruba-land showed similar peaks in

parasite resistant selection, though 10,000 years ago in the former and 8500 in the latter

Incidentally very striking that cases of strong outbreeding, e.g between sapiens and
neanderthalensis resulted in us acquiring ~3% of our genome from them, half were local-
environment genes—fair skin, less hair on back, blue eyes and red hair on head—and half

PARASITE-RESISTANT GENES (MHC genes).

Likewise interbreeding between ‘us' and Denisovens in Tibet helped us acquire alleles

uniquely suited for high altitude and, once again, resistance to local parasites.

Logic is obvious--if you are moving into Europe for the first time you are adapted to the
parasites from which you came (malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, this that and the third

African disease) but not those in the area you are invading (smallpox, the plague)

3--Human genetic diversity declines as people move from Africa outwards--why? Serial
founder effect. It is always a sub-group of the larger group that decides to go over the
next mountain and colonize the valley. They can rapidly reconstitute numbers but not lost
genetic diversity—trepeated over and over you see a steady decline in genetic diversity
from Africa to mid-East Europe Asia (Russia) and finally into arctic America and right

down to southern America within ~1000 generations

Hence Amerindians highly vulnerable to invasion of Europeans + Africans, bringing in
small-pox, the plague, malaria, dengue fever to which they were highly vulnerable. Ever
see pictures of adult Indians with their entire outer skin peeling off as they died hideous

deaths from smallpox? Did you know that part of the genocide was to pass out “smallpox
