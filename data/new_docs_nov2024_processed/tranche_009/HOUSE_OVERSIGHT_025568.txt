Deconstructing Our Implied Carry Valuation:
What Is the Market Paying?

We deconstruct the various pieces of a SOTP for the alts
in order to determine our best guess on how much the
market is valuing future performance fees. We then
divide that implied value by future performance fee earn-
ings, to determine the implied multiple that the market is
paying for this earings stream. This is the groundwork for
our upside and downside scenarios if the alts were to
convert to C-corps.

We simplify our the SOTP and standardize it across the group to
look at &4 main components. 1) after-tax core fee-related earnings,
2) balance sheet value of investments plus net cash/debt, 3) net
accrued carry balance, and &) future value of performance fees. The
values of the balance sheet and net accrued carry receivable are
static items with balances as of 3Q17. We then adjust the multiple on
our core FRE to determine a value for what we believe the street is
using. To be conservative, we use 15x as a starting point for what we
believe is currently priced in. We then take the current share price
and subtract out the value of the FRE, net accrued carry performance
fees and the balance sheet and we are left with an implied value of
what the marketis pricing in for future carry. Once we have the future
carry value, we divide by the net performance fee earnings per share
for each company and get an implied multiple on the future perform-
ance fees. Using this approach and a 15x multiple on FRE, we see the

market is valuing future performance fees at 7.5x on average anda

We make several key adjustments in the SOTP valuations: First,
we use our own Morgan Stanley definition of core fee-related earn-
ings in our calculation. We use our core approach as we attempt to
normalize the various definitions of FRE across the companies. The
main difference vs. company-reported FRE is that we fully burden all
expenses, including equity-based compensation. KKR differs the
most on company-reported vs. MS Core FRE. For more information

on our core FRE methodology, please see our note Alternative Asset

Managers: Who@Got Swimsuits? (19 May 2016).

We also make adjustments for ARES an OAK. For Ares: a signifi-
cant portion of the fee related earnings come from Part 1 BDC fees.
These are investment income sharing fees from their management
agreement with ARCC. In the MS approach, we value these sepa-
rately from more traditional management fees. However, we do not
believe that the market looks at the fees this way, and so we include
them in the total FRE by using the same multiple as we are using for
FRE (15x). For presentation purposes in the table below, we break out
the BDC Part 1 fees separately for ARES to show the value. OAK: We
adjust the balance of OAK@investments on balance sheet to account
for OAK© 20% ownership stake in DoubleLine which it currently
holds at cost of $21m as adjusted under the equity method of
accounting. With the benefit of lower corporate taxes we currently
value OAK@ownership stake at $1B. We do not believe the market

gives full value for this 20% ownership and haircut our MSe value by

median 6.5x. 50% to $500m. We then add this value to the balance of investments
and net cash for OAK@total balance sheet value.
