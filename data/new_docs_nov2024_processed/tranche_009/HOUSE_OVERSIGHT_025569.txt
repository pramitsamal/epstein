Upside Scenario

Starting with the framework laid out above, we make several key
adjustments in our upside scenario to illustrate where we think mul-
tiples go and where the stocks can trade over the near term if the alts
convert. Our upside scenario implies an average share price increase

of 13% across the group.

e First we fully tax effect the performance fee earnings.
Under a C-corp structure these would not get the pass-
through benefit and would be subject to full taxes. We use a
full 24% tax drag on the net accrued carry receivable balance
and the future net carry per share.

e@ Second we adjust the FRE multiples upward. As we dis-
cussed previously with our three approaches for FREmulti-
ples, we believe there is significant upside to the value of
these earnings if alts were to convert. This drives nearly all of
the upside from current prices in our upside scenario. We use
a 22.5x multiple on FRE in our upside case, which represents

50% increase from the 15x multiple that we believe is priced

in today.

e Last we assume 2x of multiple expansion for performance

fees. As a starting point, we look at the implied multiples
using current share prices and a 15x multiple for FRE as
described above. We then add 2x turns of multiple expansion
to each of the companies@urrent implied multiples. We look
to the Goldman Sachs example earlier in the note as a comp
for cyclical financials earnings. Our group median for implied
future carry multiples of 8.5x is just under one standard devi-
ation away from GS@historical P/E average of 9.5x. Although
we use the higher multiple, this is on a lower value of fully
taxed future performance fee earnings. The impact to valua-
tion of future performance fees are mixed from company and
can be seen in greater detail in the following appendix with
company specific SOTP and scenario analysis. While we
expect some multiple expansion for performance fees ina
C-corp, the structure will not change the inherent vola-
tility of the performance fee portion of earnings that is

marked to market.
