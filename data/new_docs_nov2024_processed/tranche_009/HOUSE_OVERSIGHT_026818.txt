- China now has a rapidly growing radical Islam problem: Ethnic Uyghur’s — who

are Turkic speaking — feel badly repressed and left out of the Chinese economic

growth.

- They have become increasingly radicalized. Uyghur’s are fighting with ISIS and al-

Qaeda. More importantly, they are conducting more and more terrorist strikes within

China. China now is seeking to engage in Afghanistan. And they have become a key

partner to Pakistan in recent years.
