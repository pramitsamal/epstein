Al-Qaeda in Iraq has already taken advantage of this situation through its
front group, the Islamic State of Iraq, which deployed combat teams in
Fallujah last month that targeted Iraqi army positions and killed several
soldiers. The jihadists’ black flags have appeared at Sunni protests and
memorial ceremonies for the fallen. The group is back in the havens it
held in 2006. If Maliki does not allow proper Sunni representation in
government, al-Qaeda will gain greater popular tolerance and foreign
support.

Over the past year, the situation in Iraq has become explosive while
sectarian sentiment and armed violence in neighboring nations have
escalated dramatically. Americans have become accustomed to watching
Iraq approach the precipice and draw back. But circumstances have
changed with the withdrawal of all U.S. forces and Maliki’s year-long
efforts to intimidate his opponents through political, judicial and military
maneuvers. If Maliki does not accept many of the protesters’ reasonable
demands and allow meaningful Sunni participation in government,
prospects for stopping Iraq’s descent into sectarian conflict are grim.
