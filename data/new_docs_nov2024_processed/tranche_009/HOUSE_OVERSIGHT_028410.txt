expected to meet with state attorneys general to discuss alleged stifling of conservative speech online,
as well as possible antitrust concerns over Google as well as Facebook and others. On Wednesday, the
Senate Commerce Committee holds a hearing focused on internet privacy concerns, amid growing
bipartisan calls for legislation to govern online data collection and use.,type:text},{identifier:_anf-

Trump.,type:text},{identifier:_anf-body-23,layout:bodyLayout,role:body”,text:But the
current antitech atmosphere goes beyond political maneuvering. As concerns grow among lawmakers

Senate.,type:text},{identifier:_anf-body-24,layout:bodyLayout,role:body,text:That reality
came home in a letter that a bipartisan group of senators wrote last week to the Trump administration,
urging legislation to impose a new “enforceable nationwide standard” for collection and use of online
data. The letter was written by the top Republicans and Democrats on two Senate Commerce
subcommittees, Sens. Jerry Moran (R., Kan.), Roger Wicker (R., Miss.), Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.)
and Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii). The administration also could release its own set of principles for online
privacy this week. They could further fuel talk of broad online privacy legislation—something the tech
companies have successfully avoided for
