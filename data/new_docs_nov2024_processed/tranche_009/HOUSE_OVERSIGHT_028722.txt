the Middle East's Islamists, and specifically
the Muslim brotherhood, whom the Qataris
view as the region's rising power. The
Qatari strategy is that the situation has
changed, and we need to fend for ourselves
and ensure that the regional anarchy is not
going to impact us, says Bokhari. The
Qatari investment in Rawabi -- which feeds
an $85 million investment in the Israeli
economy, and which could not have
happened without some degree of official
Israeli approval -- is an example of this
larger geopolitical strategy, which is driven
more by perceived self-interest than by an
ideological affinity for political Islam.

Investments in the region are about the
return on political influence, adds Gregory
Gause, a professor at the University of
Vermont and a non-resident senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution-Doha. He
noted the presence of a large American
airbase in Qatar, and the country's close
relations with the United States.

In the Palestinian territories, as in the
broader region, the Qataris are supporting
secular and religious forces in a way that
will maximize their influence and keep the
regional balance as favorable for them as
possible. In a sense, the same strategic
calculus that convinces Qatar to support
Hamas allows them to cooperate with Israel
and the West Bank private sector as well.
