One is crony capitalism, or what we call state-controlled capitalism, and that’s the big
thing the tea party is fighting in the United States, and really the tea party’s biggest fight is
not with the left, because we’re not there yet. The biggest fight the tea party has today is
just like UKIP. UKIP’s biggest fight is with the Conservative Party.

The tea party in the United States’ biggest fight is with the the Republican establishment,
which is really a collection of crony capitalists that feel that they have a different set of
rules of how they’re going to comport themselves and how they’re going to run things.
And, quite frankly, it’s the reason that the United States’ financial situation is so dire,
particularly our balance sheet. We have virtually a hundred trillion dollars of unfunded
liabilities. That is all because you've had this kind of crony capitalism in Washington, DC.
The rise of Breitbart is directly tied to being the voice of that center-right opposition. And,
quite frankly, we’re winning many, many victories.

On the social conservative side, we’re the voice of the anti-abortion movement, the voice of
the traditional marriage movement, and I can tell you we’re winning victory after victory
after victory. Things are turning around as people have a voice and have a platform of

which they can use.
