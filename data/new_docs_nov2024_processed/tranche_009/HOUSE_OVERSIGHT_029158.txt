2— His suggestion that chimpanzee dominance hierarchies consist of a version of
psychopathy is utterly novel to me and most interesting. I had always thought of
dominance hierarchies as being associated with tyranny and despotism—but are
these not often associated with psychopathy?!

“NEAR FIXATION”—SEZ WHO? OH YOU AND YOUR STUDENTS—NOW THAT'S A
SURPRISE.

Consider the “Butcher of Bagdad” Saddam Hussein or the sadistic Basir Assad. The
only thing they didn’t do is specialize in rape, although Saddam’s son Uday did and
we can be sure each had greater than average reproductive success but note how
sensitive each is to degree of relatedness writ large. Saddam was most biased
toward people that came from his place of birth, along the Tigrit River, then people
in the surrounding province and then Sunnis over Shia.

Since he was willing to kill others on a large scale—200,000 Shia slaughtered when
the idiotic first Bush allowed Saddam to retain his Airforce after we had marched to
Bagdad after flinging Saddam’s troops out of Kuwait. Or for that matter, Saddam’s
attack on Shia Iran which claimed more than a million lives on both sides.
