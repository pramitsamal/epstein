decades of struggle so that “equality of rights” wouldn’t be empty
words, and so that rape, for example, would be recognized as a crime.
But giving voice to the lowly is one thing. Considering this voice as
Gospel is quite another—which can be the source of new and
dreadful injustices. Yet this is exactly what has happened with his
accuser’s charges.

And I am still asking myself how so many editorialists, so many great
consciences and, by the way, so many feminists could take it as a
given that the word of this woman—of whom we knew only what
filtered through the incomplete language of justice—was necessarily
infallible.

The truth is that we have passed from one extreme to the other. The
era when the word of the System’s victims was, on principle,
discredited has given way to one in which it is—also on principle—
attributed all prestige.

Yet I repeat: To be a victim of society is one thing, and no one doubts
that the alleged victim of the supposed rape is at least the victim of a
social order that pays its hotel maids peanuts and treats them like
livestock.

But to be the victim of aggression is another thing entirely and of an
entirely different nature. It must be established methodically,
scrupulously, and with discretion, by comparing evidence, viewpoints
and witness accounts and by avoiding the interference of emotion,
even when justified, that may motivate one and another. This is a
question of principle.

this case and that is the very principle, in the United States, of the
presumption of innocence. Soon there will be another, I mean
another victim, should it be verified that the accuser also lied about
what actually happened in this now-legendary suite at the Sofitel, and
that will be Dominique Strauss-Kahn himself. But from now on, there
