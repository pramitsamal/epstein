world Jewry. Such a resolution is supported by four facts: All
attempts to establish two states have ended in failure; the Jewish and
Palestinian populations are too intertwined to separate except forcibly
which would constitute apartheid; the physical geography and natural
resources such as water and natural gas in coastal waters make
division a source of perpetual tension; it is imperative to eliminate the
current legitimacy given to Israel's racist colonial system and to
establish a just political culture for all.

The resolution's implementation would be the responsibility of the
UN and Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. To
succeed, representatives of world powers may have to serve as even-
handed observers.

The international focus on the Goldstone Report elaborating Israel's
alleged crimes in Gaza, and on its assault on the humanitarian aid
flotilla uncover only the tip of the iceberg of Israel's violations of
international law. The UN is within its rights to sanction Israel for its
defiance of international laws and norms. However, although Israel is
the primary offender, Lebanon (denying Palestinians minimum
civilian rights), Jordan (withdrawing citizenship without due process
of the law), and the PA (an autocratic police- state), should all be
held accountable for gross human rights violations against the
Palestinians.

While a new course should be set based on reconciliation and
forgiveness, Israeli and Arab individuals charged with such war
crimes and human rights violations must be prosecuted. The General
Assembly should, therefore, establish an International Criminal
Tribunal as a subsidiary organ under Article 22 of the UN Charter
for this very purpose.

The proposed shift in the paradigms regarding the Palestinian/Israeli
conflict, once implemented will contribute to three UN goals: peace
and security of the West Asian/North African region as the new state
