ASEAN claimants. But a second such incident occurred on June 9 —
only two weeks later. Earlier, on March 4, the Philippines protested
an incident on the Reed Bank in which two Chinese patrol boats

China responded to frenetic protests from Vietnam and the

U.S. attention. These disputes and even such incidents are certainly
not new but why are they occurring now, and why is China sending
very mixed signals?

This was supposed to be a period of negotiations to transform the
DOC into an official enforceable code. Needless to say, this effort
may now be moribund.

Despite China's rhetoric, ASEAN nations are genuinely alarmed and

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's speech at the ARF Foreign
Minister's meeting in Hanoi in July 2010 — is only too happy to help —

the Impeccable, the Victorious, the Bowditch in what it claims 1s its
waters — not conflicting claims to islands or ocean space. These can
only be linked in one worst scenario: that China has decided that it
disagrees with portions of the U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty that it
