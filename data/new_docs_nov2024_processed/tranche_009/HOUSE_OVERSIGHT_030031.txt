March 28, 2011 -- While one war rages in Libya, another rages in
Washington as to the necessity of U.S. action there. Indeed, Defense

an Arab state in the throes of unrest, one that is key to its regional
and national interests, planners might want to pay more attention to
Syria, which is currently undergoing upheaval not seen since the
early 1980s. Syria lies at the center of a dense network of Middle

resulted in the deaths of well over 100 civilians, and possibly close to
double that number -- is likely to have a major impact on the regional
structure of power. The need to contain pressure from the United

leadership, has suddenly been displaced by an explosion of popular
protest highlighting urgent and long-neglected domestic issues.

If the regime fails to tame this domestic unrest, Syria's external
influence will inevitably be enfeebled, with dramatic repercussions
across the Middle East. As the crisis deepens, Syria's allies tremble.
Meanwhile, its enemies rejoice, as a weakened Syria would remove
an obstacle to their ambitions. But nature abhors a vacuum, and what
