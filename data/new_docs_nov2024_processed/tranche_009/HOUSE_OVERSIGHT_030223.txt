may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness, unless the
information concerned ought demonstrably to be published in the public
interest and there is an over-riding need to make or promise payment

for this to be done; and all reasonable steps have been taken to

ensure no financial dealings influence the evidence those witnesses
give. In no circumstances should such payment be conditional on the
outcome of a trial.

*111) Any payment or offer of payment made to a person later cited to
give evidence in proceedings must be disclosed to the prosecution and
defence. The witness must be advised of this requirement.

*Payment to criminals

i) Payment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information,
which seek to exploit a particular crime or to glorify or glamorise
crime in general, must not be made directly or via agents to convicted
or confessed criminals or to their associates — who may include
family, friends and colleagues.

ii) Editors invoking the public interest to justify payment or offers
would need to demonstrate that there was good reason to believe the
public interest would be served. If, despite payment, no public
interest emerged, then the material should not be published.

this story..the headline is deliberately wrong..school adults would have been accurate..
