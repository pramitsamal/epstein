Dear Ghislaine

Thank you for your good-humoured patience with us and the legal team today, during what is,
understandably, a testing time.

To confirm:

1) I spoke to Dilenschneider in NYC at length tonight and shared strategy and role definition.
2) we sent agreed statement to Dan Mangan ay NYPost - he's on deadline for a piece on Charlie
Sheen/Rob Lowe and seems to have moved on - for the moment.

3) we will release statement via Press Association and PR Newswire @11.00GMT tmrw and
follow up with calls to those journalists who have written pieces.

We will create call log/matrix and advise feedback and sentiment as appropriate tmrw. Please don't
hesitate to call if you have any additional concerns.

Best regards
Ross
