Dear Ghislaine
Thank you for your good-humoured patience with us and the legal team today, during what is, understandably, a testing time.

To confirm:

1) I spoke to Dilenschneider in NYC at length tonight and shared strategy and role definition.

2) we sent agreed statement to Dan Mangan ay NYPost - he's on deadline for a piece on Charlie Sheen/Rob Lowe and seems to
have moved on - for the moment.

3) we will release statement via Press Association and PR Newswire @11.00GMT tmrw and follow up with calls to those
journalists who have written pieces.

We will create call log/matrix and advise feedback and sentiment as appropriate tmrw. Please don't hesitate to call if you have
any additional concerns.

Best regards
Ross
