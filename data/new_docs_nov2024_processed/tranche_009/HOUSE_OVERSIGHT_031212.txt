that the public will still have free access to the island’s
shoreline, which includes Christmas Cove, a popular boating
site and home to floating restaurant Pizza Pi.

A wealthy financier long associated with the rich and
powerful, including former President Bill Clinton and
President Donald Trump, Epstein, 66, was convicted in 2008
of procuring a child under the age of 18 for prostitution.

An investigation by the Miami Herald found that despite
evidence Epstein sexually abused dozens of underage girls,
some who say they were forced to have sex with Epstein’s
rich friends at his various homes, including on Little St.
James, federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta — who now
serves as U.S. secretary of labor — worked with Epstein’s
defense attorneys to craft an extraordinarily lenient plea
deal.

A federal judge ruled in February that Miami prosecutors
violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act when they
intentionally kept that agreement secret from victims in the

case.

While Epstein owns lavish properties in New York City, Palm
Beach, and New Mexico that he travels between on his private
Boeing 727, he lists Little St. James as his primary residence
on his sex offender registration.

Epstein last verified his registration with the V.I. Justice
Department on March 15, which lists the 11 vehicles he owns
— all of which are black — including a Mercedes-Benz S550,
Bentley Arnage, Hurnmer II, Dodge Caravan, Range Rover,
three Chevy Suburbans and three Cadillac Escalades.
