Which Road Will Egypt Take?

Kathryn Alexeeff

May 19, 2014 -- With Abdul Fattah al-Sisi’s official resignation from the
military and bid for the presidency, the future of Egypt looks murky at
best. While his victory is highly likely, the question remains—down which
path will he take Egypt? Al-Sisi’s support for the anti-Morsi protesters
may indicate support for the democratization of Egypt and the will of the
people. On the other hand, his bid looks like a giant leap backwards for
Egypt, a return to a military dictatorship. Egypt has several potential paths
forward under an al-Sisi government, none of which are ideal.
Unfortunately, Egypt appears to be justifying analysts’ worst fears and
will likely return to a Mubarak-style military autocracy under al-Sisi.

The first option is a military government that enacts economic and
political reforms that improve the lives of the citizenry, not just the
military or the elites. This will lead to a slower evolution toward
democracy. On the plus side, slower evolution under a stable government
would allow structural changes to take root, fostering effective institutions
and greater stability. The negative side is that evolution of this sort would
be neither smooth nor straightforward. It would come in fits and spurts,
punctuated by returns to oppression and violence. It would also be
extremely slow, and easy for a demagogue to reverse. Unfortunately,
given Egypt’s current situation, option one is highly unlikely. Given the
high levels of repression and violence, the only reforms the government
will likely enact would involve greater centralized power in its hands.
Furthermore, there are a myriad of ways for a government to pay lip
service to democratization without actually decreasing its power. Another
option is that Egypt becomes stuck in a proverbial time loop—trepeating
the revolution every year or two when the government fails to deliver on
