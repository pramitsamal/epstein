The Illusion of Peace with Syria

Elhott Abrams

May 23, 2011 -- The news from Syria grows grimmer by the day—
more peaceful protesters killed, ten thousand arrested in the past
week, army units shelling residential neighborhoods.

But the Obama administration’s response has not grown grimmer or
louder. As recently as May 6, Secretary of State Clinton was still
talking about a “reform agenda” in Syria, as if Bashar al-Assad were
a slightly misguided bureaucrat rather than the murderer of roughly
1,000 unarmed demonstrators. As for the president, though the White
House has issued a couple of statements in his name, he has yet to say
one word on camera about the bloodletting in Syria. This is not a
small matter, for a tough statement attacking the regime’s repression
and giving the demonstrators moral support would immediately
circulate over the Internet. American sanctions against Syria,
meanwhile, have not named Assad, and there has been no call for him
to step down.

Why is the administration appearing to stick with Assad and refusing
to call for his ouster? A key reason may be the hope that an Israeli-
Syrian peace deal can be arranged.

From the day it came to office, the Obama administration clearly
wanted to win an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. There has been
no progress during its two years in office, mostly because the White
House insisted on a 100 percent construction freeze in the West Bank
settlements and Jerusalem as a precondition for negotiations. This
was politically impossible in Israel, and also meant that Palestinian
president Mahmoud Abbas could not come to the table lest he appear
to be asking less from Israel than the Americans.
