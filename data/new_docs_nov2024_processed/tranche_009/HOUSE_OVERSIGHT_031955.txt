Barack Obama's Foreign Policy

November 16, 2011

Foreign-policy credentials: As president, Obama has taken on a
number of major foreign-policy initiatives, including a renewed troop
surge in Afghanistan, the negotiation of the New START nuclear
arms reduction treaty with Russia, the NATO intervention in Libya,
the withdrawal from Iraq, ongoing trade negotiations with China, and
of course, the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

Overview: Obama is a much different candidate today from the
senator who distinguished himself by his opposition to the dumb
war on his way to the presidency in 2008. Obama has turned out, in
many ways, to have pursued a fairly conventional, at times, hawkish
foreign policy. He has had some notable successes, such as the bin
Laden raid and this year's withdrawal from Iraq -- albeit on a
timetable negotiated by his predecessor -- and the successful
overthrow of Muammar al-Qaddafi. All the same, apology tours
and leading from behind -- referring to an unfortunate description
of Obama's diplomatic strategy by a White House staffer -- have
already become buzzwords for Republican candidates. He has also
faced heavy criticism on the left for a sometimes inconsistent
approach to international law in counterterrorism operations.

But with a significant economic recovery appearing unlikely and
fewer domestic achievements to point to than he might have
expected, coupled with the international inexperience of his
opponents, Obama may make his foreign-policy wins the centerpiece
of his reelection strategy.
