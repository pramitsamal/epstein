On a nine-mile stretch of Playa Blanca, just 20 minutes from downtown
Zihuatanejo, Hotel Las Palmas is unique escape between lush rain
forest and the open Pacific Ocean. All 10 suites were individually
designed by Enrique Zozaya in a sleek, modern-tropical style and
capture the unspoiled views on private terraces and balconies. With the
soaring Sierra Madre del Sur mountains in the distance and sleepy
fishing village of Barra de Potosi close by, the Hotel Las Palmas is a
true barefoot hideaway in a quintessentially Mexican setting.
