Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or
anything of the kind.

All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home).

The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great
artists when they need it.

Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go
directly to the source.

This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet,
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect
in person.

The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source.

Once again, not sure was drifted away from this in communication
