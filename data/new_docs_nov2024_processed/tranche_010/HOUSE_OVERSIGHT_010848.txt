anyone who told you that they, that person, had
discussed the subject matter of Virginia Roberts's
allegations against Professor Dershowitz with
Mr. Josefsberg? Just did you discuss it with anyone?

MR, SCAROLA: Same objection. Same

instruction.

MR. SIMPSON: Okay.

MR. SCAROLA: If you want to rephrase the

question to ask him whether he had such a
conversation with anyone outside the
attorney/client or work-product privilege, that's
a question that we are obliged to answer.

The question, as you phrased it, is a

question that we are precluded from answering.

MR. SIMPSON: That's a very strange notion of

privilege.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. But let me ask it this way: Did you discuss
with anyone who is not an attorney -- let me rephrase it
a different way.

You testified yesterday about your
understanding of the scope of the alleged
common-interest privilege, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Putting aside the people within the scope of

that privilege --

A. Yes.

Q. -- that you identified --

A. Uh-huh.

Q. -- your definition of it --

A. Right. That's right.

Q. -~ did you discuss the topic -- did anyone

tell you they had discussed the topic of Virginia
Roberts's allegations against Professor Dershowitz with
Mr. Josefsberg?

MR. SCAROLA: You may not answer that
question to the extent the question still
encompasses attorney/client privileged
communications. If you want to rephrase the
question to exclude both common-interest
privileged communications and attorney/client
privileged communications, that's a question we
are prepared to answer.

Otherwise, we are prohibited from answering
the question as phrased as a consequence of it
encompassing privileged communications.

MR. SIMPSON: As he defined the
common-interest privileged group, it included
attormey/client, but I think at this point the
explanations you're providing aren't really

helpful. So please just instruct him to answer
or not answer, and we will let the judge decide.

MR. SCAROLA: Well, the instruction -- I only
gave the explanation in the hope that it might
facilitate the examination and allow you to move
to areas where you can get substantive
information.

I apologize if you consider it a waste of
time. So I will simply instruct Professor
Cassell not to answer the question as phrased.
If you ever want an explanation as to the basis
of my instruction, I'm prepared to give that to
you.

MR. SIMPSON: Thank you. That -- that's a
helpful way to proceed.

MR. SCAROLA: Okay.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Have you -- well, let's start this way: Have
you discussed with any of the attorneys within what you
described as the common-interest attorney/client group,
whether that person had discussed with Mr. Josefsberg
Virginia Roberts's allegations against Professor
Dershowitz?

MR. SCAROLA: Same objection. Same
instruction,

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Have you discussed with anyone who is not an
attorney for Miss Roberts whether -- strike that.

Has anyone who is not an attorney for

Miss Roberts told you that they had discussed with
Mr. Josefsberg the allegations against -- by Virginia
Roberts against Professor Dershowitz?

MR. SCAROLA: Same objection. Same

instruction.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Have you personally spoken with anyone else
at Mr. Josefsberg's firm, other than him, about Virginia
Roberts's allegations against Professor Dershowitz?

A. Not to my knowledge.

MS. McCAWLEY: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can
you read that back?

MR. SCAROLA: Was a communication with anyone
else in Bob Josefsberg -- Bob Josefsberg's firm,
personal communication between Professor Cassell
and any firm member of Bob Josefsberg.

MS. McCAWLEY: Okay.

BY MR, SIMPSON:

Q. And the answer was, not that you recall?

A. Not to my knowledge. I don't know all the
members of his firm, but I certainly have no
