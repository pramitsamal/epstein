understanding would be that if her -- and this is --
could I ask a question about the circling -- or your
representation?

Is the circling the same type of circling
that is done for Mr. Dershowitz, for example? Is it the
same, you know, handwriting, same ink, same -- same
appearance? You know, if it's consistent with the
circling -- are you representing it's consistent with
the circling?

Q. Mr. Cassell, we have a document produced in

discovery that has various names circled. Looking at
the document, I don't see any difference among the
circles. Are you aware of any document --
MR. SCAROLA: Could we have a look -- could
we see the document?
MR. SIMPSON: Take a -- go off the record for
one moment.
THE WITNESS: We are going off the video
record, 10:03.
(Thereupon, a recess was taken.)
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video
record, 10:08 a.m.
MR. SIMPSON: Okay. Back on the record. I'm
going to ask the reporter to mark as Cassell
Exhibit 5, a multi-page document. It's a copy of

the address book we have been speaking about, and
ask that Doc -- Mr. Cassell to take a look at
this, and I'm going to ask him about certain of
the entries.

(Cassell's I.D. Exhibit No. 5 - copy of
address book was marked for identification.)
MR. SIMPSON: And I will note, I put a few
flags on here --

THE WITNESS: Sure.

MR. SIMPSON: -- to direct your attention --
THE WITNESS: Correct, yeah.
MR. SIMPSON: -- which we can -~ I'll note

the pages for the record just so we have them.
38, 76, and 85.
THE WITNESS: Okay. I just -- I just want to
take two minutes or So --
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Yeah. Take -- take a moment to look at it.

A. Okay. I want to make a few notes, if that's
all right, just to get them in --

Q. You're going to mark on the --

A. No, not on the exhibit. I'm just going to
make notes to refresh my recollection so we don't have
to take time. I'm just -- I'm just making notes of the
context here. This will just take another minute is

all.

Q. Take as long as you want to look at the
document.

A. Super. Thank you.

Okay. Yeah. I think I'm -- I'm oriented
now. But I haven't looked at the Love entry.

Q. My -- my first --

A. Iwant to look at the Love --

Q.  -- question is: Is this a copy of the
address book that you referred to in your testimony?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And if you would take a look at the --
I've marked the entries for Courtney Love. Take a look
at that one.

A. Allright. I see it.

Q. Okay. And then if you look at the last
entry, there's an entry for Professor Dershowitz that's
also circled. It should be on the flag. It's
two-sided.

A. Oh, yeah.

Q. Do you see that one?

A. Isee it.

Q. And then also the other one I marked is
Donald Trump.

A, Yes. Gotit. I see those entries circled.

Q. So am I right -- I'm right, am I not, that
among the others circled are: Courtney Love, Donald
Trump, and Alan Dershowitz, correct?

A. Correct, among the others, yes.

Q. And they are all circled in the same way; are
they not?

A, Yeah. It's kind of a -- a box is what I
would say. Some, yes.

Q. Is there anything on the face of that
document that leads you to conclude that the circling --
the significance of the circling is any different for
one person than another?

A. No.

Q. So based on the document, do you infer that
Courtney Love was involved in some kind of sexual abuse
of minors?

A. Iwould infer that if I were running a
criminal investigation through the FBI and I'm trying to
find people who would have relevant information, she
would be one of the people I'd want to talk to. I mean,
the names that are circled here, Glenn Maxwell, one of
the identified traffickers, Epstein is circled, the
pilot -~ one of the pilots is circled. So it's these
people that all seemed to be connected are -- are all
being marked here, and -- and the number of people that
