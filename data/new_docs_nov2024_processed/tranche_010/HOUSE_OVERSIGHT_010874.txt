o2s049 24 the bait that -- you know, I'm -- I'm speaking

o2s040 22 colloquially here. These are -- these are young girls

025034 23 who are being sexually abused. Once the criminal

estot 1 information that they could use to blackmail those orsa39 1 A. That -- within days of -- the chronology is
ozs02 2 people and -- and then get favors in exchange. o2zs343 2 important here: The allegations were filed in this

o2rsi0 | 3 And that's Epstein at the head of the o2s345 3 pleading on December 30th. Several days after that,
estos 4 organization would be the one who would benefit most | oz24e 4 Mr. Dershowitz then took to the airwaves to denounce,
os111 5 directly from the black -- the blackmail information. o2s353 § not only Brad and me, but -- but particularly of concern
ozstir2 6 Q. And by “blackmail information,” do you mean costs 6& to me was Virginia Roberts, this victim of sex

osii7 7 that Mr, Epstein then had information that he could ass 7 trafficking.

028119 8 threaten to disclose if the other person didn't do what ozsaso 8 And, at that point, as one of -- as one of

ost32 12 had access to publicity, she had exactly the same

ezst36 13 ability to blackmail people; isn't that true?

o2s217 24 Mr. Epstein; isn't that true? 28447 24 Professor Dershowitz would get substantial publicity?
