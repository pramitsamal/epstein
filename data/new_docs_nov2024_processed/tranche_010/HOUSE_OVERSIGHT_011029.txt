This observation helps clarify my hypothesis that job learning costs no time that
might otherwise have been spent earning pay. My deeper meaning is that invested
learning and maintenance learning are the same process costing the same time but
with different economic effect, much as with invested and maintenance

consumption.

Evidence that hourly if not yearly pay rises until retirement, or very near, would
refute Ben-Porath’s claim if human capital ended at retirement. But it continues

through retirement because imputed pay does.

Mill and a few economists before him acknowledged “productive” and
“unproductive” consumption. The productive kind was what I call maintenance and
invested consumption. Unproductive consumption meant any written invested for

higher pay later nor supporting survival pay now. That would give

pure consumption = maintenance consumption + unproductive consumption (5.8)

and

consumption = invested consumption + pure consumption
= invested consumption + maintenance consumption

+ unproductive consumption. (5.9)

Investment and maintenance contrast in human capital as in a firm. Investment is
valued only in the expectation of future maintenance. No maintenance later, no
value now. To count maintenance as new investment would count part of the old
investment twice. Where the accounting treatments differ is in disposition.
Maintenance in the firm is recovered in pay and products. | thought before that the
same was true of human capital. Thanks to the parable of the boss and her secretary,

I now I think it is exhausted in satisfying our taste for lineage survival.
