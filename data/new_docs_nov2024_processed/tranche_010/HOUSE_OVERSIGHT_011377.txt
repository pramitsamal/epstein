some of the illegal drug usage and so forth, that's not
something we're trying to deploy affirmatively. The good

And the fact that Ms. Giuffre told Dr. Kliman ina

confidential psychiatric examination certain things about drug
use can't possibly go to her reputation because no one was

A similar point can be made about tax fraud. We're

suppose that goes to her reputation with some IRS agent who is

looking at a return, but it can't possibly go to a general

reputation that is at issue in this case.

And once again, the cases that we cite in our briefs I
