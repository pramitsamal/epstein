2 THE COURT: Okay. Yes.
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, these reports, that are
4 loosely described as police reports, encompass a one-year
5) purported investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department
6 into the affairs of Mr. Epstein roughly beginning I think in
7 2005 and going through 2006. The detective initially assigned
8 to the case was a woman named Michelle Pagan, and then
9 Detective Recarey took over the investigation from Ms. Pagan.
1) There were a number of things, according to the reports --
ai although we don't really have any actual witness testimony,
12 with current knowledge. The police did a number of things.
13 They surveiled Epstein's house, they did trash pulls, and
14 ultimately they executed a search warrant at Mr. Epstein's
15 house. And that's sort of the totality of the investigation.
16 I give you that as the backdrop, your Honor, because
Ly then next what seems to happen is very curious, in my
18 experience, and was testified to by Detective Recarey. The
19 police get crossways with the state attorney's office in
20 Florida, and there is a complete distrust between the two
21. agencies. As a result of that -- and there's a bunch of
22 in-fighting that goes on between these two agencies. The
23 police make the decision to, in some fashion, turn over
24 everything that they have to the FBI. And as best I can figure
25 it out, the FBI issued a grand jury subpoena, or the U.S.
