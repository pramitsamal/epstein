Jeffrey Epstein doesn’t want to be branded as a “sex
offender” for life, and no, he’s not a modeling agency secret
sugar daddy (or so its owners say)

Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire money manager who’s agreed to plead guilty to soliciting
underaged hookers and go away for 18 months, doesn’t want to be branded a sex offender for
life. Page Six says his lawyers are thinking about asking prosecutors to drop that requirement
from his plea agreement:

In a letter drafted, but not sent, to U.S.

Attorney Alexander Costa and obtained by Page Six, Epstein’s lawyer, Gerald
Lefcourt, writes, Doing so will have a profound impact [on Epstein] both
immediately and forever after. Not only will he be restricted to a wholly
inappropriate penal facility, but he will be required for the rest of his life

to account for his whereabouts.”

Meanwhile, over the weekend Page Six said that owners of MC2 modeling, run by Jean-Luc
Brunel — who’s also been accused of favoring underaged models in the past — claim that
Epstein is not the secret deep pockets behind the firm, no matter what others say or speculate.
