Epstein, .....reportedly gave

millions to start MC2, which opened in October 2005 with offices in

New York, Miami and Tel Aviv. One of the girls Epstein, 54, was accused of
soliciting massages from was described in court documents as being just 14.

E equals MC squared .. . get it,

like the equation? E equals Epstein. He just thinks everyone is too dumb to
figure it out, said a model industry insider. He’s a desperate old

man that fantasizes and takes advantage of young girls.

Jeffrey Epstein has no ownership or involvement in our company and never has. Jean-Luc
Brunel and | are the only two partners and owners of MC2 Model Management, [Jeffrey] Fuller
said. [MC2 President]
