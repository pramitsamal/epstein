RE: 0-1 Non-immigrant Viea Petition on behalf of Jean Luc Brunei

It is ax extreme picasure to write 6 letter of recommendation for Mr. Jean
Luc Brunel. f provide thie recommendation based on my knowledgr and

nce in the field of modeling, due to my ecatablished reputation and
work in the field as the Viadimir Yudashkin, director of 1 Mother Agency.
Kiev, Ukraine

I have known Jean Luc Brunel professionally for several: yeare through
our work together and, in my opinion, he ie an extremely talented
individual] with superb professional reputation. He is an lextraordinarily
able coordinator who atrives for and attains a level of merit in his work
that only a few of his contemporaries meet. He haz the ability to
recognize the creative vision of his client within the time and budget
through his careful and thoughtful choice of model casting combined
with his meticulous ability in the eld. Jean Luc Brune! ip a true find in
our industry. |

There are plenty of art directors out there, but none with the depth and
quality that Mr. Brunel posseseca. He is unlike anyone in this industry,
and I expect to see him continue to find great models in hia successful
career. Someone overflowing with talent as Jean Luc Brunel should be
given every opportunity to work in the United States, where he will have
the proper venurs to showcase his extraordinary talents.

Please do not hesitate te contact me should you have ‘any questions
regarding this matter. Lice you for your time and -ednsideration.

Sincerely,
