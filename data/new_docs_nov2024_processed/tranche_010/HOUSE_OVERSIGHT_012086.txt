Furthermore, CHART 3 shows that, directionally, the Li Keqiang
Index maps pretty well to the ebb and flow of Chinese property
prices, confirming the thesis that property prices have much
impact on the Chinese economy.

A close examination of CHART 2 raises an interesting observation:
Lately, the Li Keqiang Index has accelerated much more than the
reported GDP growth. One could surmise that China’s actual
GDP growth (measured on a year-over-year basis rather than on
an annualized sequential change) may have been greater than
the reported 6.9% in the first quarter of 2017. This could be
rationalized by the conjecture that the actual growth in early
2016 may have been lower than the reported 6.7%.

One indicator of China’s strong growth is the year-over-year
changes in its imports as shown in CHART 4. Imports surged
24% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms, and 31% in renminbi
terms during the first quarter of 2017. To be fair, part of the
surge was due to the rebound in commodity prices. However,
China’s $58 billion import from Germany and Japan, two non-
commodity countries, was still up an impressive 17% year-on-
year. In the first quarter of 2016, China’s imports from those two
countries had declined 10%.

We believe China’ strong reflation, thanks to the infrastructure
buildout and the unprecedented property price increases in
major cities, may have been the most impactful yet under-
appreciated catalyst that fueled the synchronized global
economic recovery since the summer of 2016. The good news
is that China’s growth is likely to remain healthy for the
remainder of 2017, as stability is paramount ahead of the
quinquennial power transition this autumn. However, the
uncertainty starts to rise as we look beyond 2017.

Shadow Boxing

Over the past few years, China watchers have been urging
Chinese policymakers to introduce bold reforms and market
forces to tackle the country’s rapidly growing leverage, over
capacity, and housing bubble. However, with stability being of
utmost importance, policymakers could not afford to take a
chance with the market's invisible hand. Tough reforms in the
context of slowing economic growth also ran the risk of
jeopardizing social stability. Now, however, with the economy
ona much stronger footing, Chinese policymakers have started
to push through some needed reforms.
