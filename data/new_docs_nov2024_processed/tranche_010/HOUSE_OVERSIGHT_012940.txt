24 2 What Is Human-Like General Intelligence?

it, we will go through some more background regarding human-like intelligence (in the rest
of this chapter), philosophy of mind (in Chapter 3) and contemporary AGI architectures (in
Chapter4).

2.3 Further Characterizations of Humanlike Intelligence

We now present a few complementary approaches to characterizing the key aspects of human-
like intelligence, drawn from different perspectives in the psychology and AI literature. These
different approaches all overlap substantially, which is good, yet each gives a slightly different
slant.

2.3.1 Competencies Characterizing Human-like Intelligence

First we give a list of key competencies characterizing human level intelligence resulting from
the the AGI Roadmap Workshop held at the University of Knoxville in October 2008 ', which
was organized by Ben Goertzel and Itamar Arel. In this list, each broad competency area is
listed together with a number of specific competencies sub-areas within its scope:

Perception: vision, hearing, touch, proprioception, crossmodal

Actuation: physical skills, navigation, tool use

Memory: episodic, declarative, behavioral

Learning: imitation, reinforcement, interactive verbal instruction, written media, experi-
mentation

Reasoning: deductive, abductive, inductive, causal, physical, associational, categorization
Planning: strategic, tactical, physical, social

Attention: visual, social, behavioral

Motivation: subgoal creation, affect-based motivation, control of emotions

Emotion: expressing emotion, understanding emotion

Self: self-awareness, self-control, other-awareness

Social: empathy, appropriate social behavior, social communication, social inference, group
play, theory of mind

12. Communication: gestural, pictorial, verbal, language acquisition, cross-modal

13. Quantitative: counting, grounded arithmetic, comparison, measurement

14. Building/Creation: concept formation, verbal invention, physical construction, social
group formation

Clearly this list is getting at the same things as the textbook headings given in Section 2.2,
but with a different emphasis due to its origin among AGI researchers rather than cognitive
