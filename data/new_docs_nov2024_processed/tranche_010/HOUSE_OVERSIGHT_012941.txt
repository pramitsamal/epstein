psychologists. As part of the AGI Roadmap project, specific tasks were created corresponding
to each of the sub-areas in the above list; we will describe some of these tasks in Chapter 17.

2.3.2 Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences

The diverse list of human-level “competencies” given above is reminiscent of Gardner’s [Gar99|
multiple intelligences (MI) framework — a psychological approach to intelligence assessment
based on the idea that different people have mental strengths in different high-level domains,
so that intelligence tests should contain aspects that focus on each of these domains separately.
MI does not contradict the “complex goals in complex environments” view of intelligence, but
rather may be interpreted as making specific commitments regarding which complex tasks and
which complex environments are most important for roughly human-like intelligence.

MI does not seek an extreme generality, in the sense that it explicitly focuses on domains
in which humans have strong innate capability as well as general-intelligence capability; there
could easily be non-human intelligences that would exceed humans according to both the com-
monsense human notion of “general intelligence” and the generic “complex goals in complex
environments” or Hutter /Legg-style definitions, yet would not equal humans on the MI crite-
ria. This strong anthropocentrism of MI is not a problem from an AGI perspective so long as
one uses MI in an appropriate way, i.e. only for assessing the extent to which an AGI system
displays specifically human-like general intelligence. This restrictiveness is the price one pays
for having an easily articulable and relatively easily implementable evaluation framework.

Table ?? summarizes the types of intelligence included in Gardner’s MI theory.

Intelligence Type Aspects
Linguistic Words and language, written and spoken; retention, inter-

pretation and explanation of ideas and information via lan-
guage; understands relationship between communication
and meaning

Logical-Mathematical Logical thinking, detecting patterns, scientific reasoning
and deduction; analyse problems, perform mathematical
calculations, understands relationship between cause and
effect towards a tangible outcome

Musical Musical ability, awareness, appreciation and use of sound;
recognition of tonal and rhythmic patterns, understands
relationship between sound and feeling

Bodily-Kinesthetic Body movement control, manual dexterity, physical agility
and balance; eye and body coordination

Spatial-Visual Visual and spatial perception; interpretation and creation
of images; pictorial imagination and expression; under-
stands relationship between images and meanings, and be-
tween space and effect

Interpersonal Perception of other people’s feelings; relates to others; inter-
pretation of behaviour and communications; understands
relationships between people and their situations
