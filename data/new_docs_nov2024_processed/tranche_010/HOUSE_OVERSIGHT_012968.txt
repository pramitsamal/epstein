52 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind

unity of consciousness. In essence the contents of the global workspace form a moving bubble
of attention or awareness.

In CogPrime, this moving bubble is achieved largely via economic attention network (ECAN)
equations [GPI~ 10] that propagate virtual currency between nodes and links representing el-
ements of memories, so that the attentional focus consists of the wealthiest nodes and links.
Figures 3.3 and 3.4 illustrate the existence and flow of attentional focus in OpenCog. On the
other hand, in Hameroff’s recent model of the brain [Ham10], the brain’s moving bubble of
attention is achieved through dendro-dendritic connections and the emergent dendritic web.

Fig. 3.3: Graphical depiction of the momentary bubble of attention in the memory of an
OpenCog AI system. Circles and lines represent nodes and links in OpenCogPrimes mem-
ory, and stars denote those nodes with a high level of attention (represented in OpenCog by
the ShortTermImportance node variable) at the particular point in time.

In this perspective, self, free will and reflective consciousness are specific phenomena occur-
ring within the moving bubble of awareness. They are specific ways of experiencing awareness,
corresponding to certain abstract types of physical structures and dynamics, which we shall
endeavor to identify in detail in Appendix ??.
