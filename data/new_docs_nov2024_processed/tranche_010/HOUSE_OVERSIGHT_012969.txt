Fig. 3.4: Graphical depiction of the momentary bubble of attention in the memory of an
OpenCog AI system, a few moments after the bubble shown in Figure 3.3, indicating the mov-
ing of the bubble of attention. Depictive conventions are the same as in Figure 1. This shows
an idealized situation where the declarative knowledge remains invariant from one moment to
the next but only the focus of attention shifts. In reality both will evolve together.

3.6 Postscript: Formalizing Pattern

Finally, before winding up our very brief tour through patternist philosophy of mind, we will
briefly visit patternism’s more formal side. Many of the key aspects of patternism have been
rigorously formalized. Here we give only a few very basic elements of the relevant mathematics,
which will be used later on in the exposition of CogPrime. (Specifically, the formal definition of
pattern emerges in the CogPrime design in the definition of a fitness function for “pattern min-
ing” algorithms and Occam-based concept creation algorithms, and the definition of intensional
inheritance within PLN.)
We give some definitions, drawn from Appendix 1 of [Goe06a];:

Definition 1 Given a metric space (M,d), and two functions c: M — [0,co| (the “simplicity
measure”) and F: M —> M (the “production relationship”), we say that P © M is a pattern
in X € M to the degree
