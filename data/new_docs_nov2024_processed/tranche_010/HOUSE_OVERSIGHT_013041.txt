Fig. 6.9: Example of Implicit Knowledge in the Atomspace. A simple example of implicit
knowledge in the Atomspace. The chicken and food concepts are represented by maps
of ConceptNodes interconnected by HebbianLinks, where the latter tend to form between Con-
ceptNodes that are often simultaneously important. The bundle of links between nodes in the
chicken map and nodes in the food map, represents an “implicit, emergent link between the
two concept maps. This diagram also illustrates glocal knowledge representation, in that the
chicken and food concepts are each represented by individual nodes, but also by distributed
maps. The chicken ConceptNode, when important, will tend to make the rest of the map
important — and vice versa. Part of the overall chicken concept possessed by the system is ex-
pressed by the explicit links coming out of the chicken ConceptNode, and part is represented
only by the distributed chicken map as a whole.
