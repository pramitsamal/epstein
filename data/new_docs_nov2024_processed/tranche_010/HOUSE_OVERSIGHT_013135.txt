12.5 Clarifying the Ethics of Justice: Extending the Golden Rule in to a Multifactorial Ethical Model 219

Stage Characteristics
Enlightened Ethics

e Reflexive cognitive basis

e Permeation of the categorical imperative and the quest
for coherence through inner as well as outer life

e Experientially grounded and logically supported rejection
of the illusion of moral certainty in favor of a case-specific
analytical and empathetic approach that embraces the
uncertainty of real social life

e Deep understanding of the illusory and biased nature of
the individual self, leading to humility regarding one’s
own ethical intuitions and prescriptions

e@ Openness to modifying one’s deepest, ethical (and other)
beliefs based on experience, reason and/or empathic com-
munion with others

e Adaptive, insightful approach to civil disobedience, con-
sidering laws and social customs in a broader ethical and
pragmatic context

e Broad compassion for and empathy with all sentient be
ings

e A recognition of inability to operate at this level at all
times in all things, and a vigilance about self-monitoring
for regressive behavior.

will enable us to tailor its environment and instructions more suitably than can be done in the
human case.

If an absolute guarantee of the ethical soundness of an AGI is what one is after, the line of
thinking proposed here is not at all useful. Experiential education is by its nature an uncertain
thing. One can strive to minimize the uncertainty, but it will still exist. Inspection of the
internals of an AGI’s mind is not a total solution to uncertainty minimization, because any
AGI capable of powerful general intelligence is going to have a complex internal state that
no external observer will be able to fully grasp, no matter how transparent the knowledge
representation.

However, if what one is after is a plausible, pragmatic path to architecting and educating
ethical AGI systems, we believe the ideas presented here constitute a sensible starting-point.
Certainly there is a great deal more to be learned and understood — the science and practice
of AGI ethics, like AGI itself, are at a formative stage at present. What is key, in our view, is
that as AGI technology develops, AGI ethics develops alongside and within it, in a thoroughly
coupled way.
