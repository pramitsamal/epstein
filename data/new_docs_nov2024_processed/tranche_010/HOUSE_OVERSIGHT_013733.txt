most relevantly by their computational procedures and what are computed are
empirical scaling exponents describing real observables as limited by the precision
of the observations, their resolution and series lengths (Smith, 1988; Eckmann and
Ruelle, 1992). The “correlation integral,” the probability that two vectors chosen at
random from the phase space reconstruction lie within “r” distance of each other,
not unrelated to the phase randomization controlled, Dz measure, yields statements
about amount of “nonlinearity” (not accountable by the linear regressively
capturable component of the power spectrum), which are also difficult to translate
into experimentally or theoretically useful concepts (Casdagli et al, 1997). These
efforts contrast with a more direct attempt to establish a spiking neuron system’s
dynamical “dimension” using trial and error prediction in which “dimension” was
defined as the number of potentially physiologically relevant variables required to

make the predictive equations fit (Segundo et al, 1998).

Computations of scaling exponent descriptors of orbital point distributions on
reconstructed attractors of the brain sciences have proven to be most useful as
atheoretical, empirical techniques discriminating experimental, clinical and/or
treatment conditions with various approaches to statistical significance. In this
regard, one can say that D2 is often found to be superior to central tendency
oriented statistics in making these discriminations. Dimension and _ correlation
integral descriptors appear least useful when dealing with global issues such as
chaos, randomness, linearity and the “underlying dimensions” of (unknown)
differential equations. We discuss below the possibility that the failure to find chaos
in the more recent EEG studies (Theiler and Rapp, 1996; Prichard et al, 1996) may

be because the EEG attractor is better characterized as a “strange nonchaotic
atttractor” with orbital patterns manifesting fractional scaling exponents but no 2(+)
(Grebogi et al, 1984; Mandell and Selz, 1993).

The relatively subtle influence of high altitude (Mt. Everest) oxygen
concentrations was not seen in the central moments of the cardiac interbeat

intervals, but the D2 of the attactor was reduced significantly (Yamamoto et al,

1993). The latencies and amplitudes of the visual evoked potential failed to
