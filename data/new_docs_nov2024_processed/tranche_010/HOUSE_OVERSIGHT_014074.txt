2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 95

Circuit’s 2008 ruling in In Re Dean, which held that the CVRA extends
rights to victims before defendants are charged.”°' We have not seen any
reports that providing the rights has been difficult.

Perhaps the reason for the lack of any reported difficulty is that the
Department’s current policy on crime victims’ rights already requires
notices to victims during investigations. The Justice Department has
promulgated the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness
Assistance, the latest edition of which is from May 2012. The Guidelines
discuss crime victims’ rights under both the CVRA and the earlier VRRA.
Because of the OLC memorandum discussed above, the Guidelines limit
CVRA rights until after the time “when criminal proceedings are initiated
by complaint, information, or indictment.”?°? The Department, however,
provides hortatory guidance that Justice Department employees shall make
“best efforts” to notify crime victims about their CVRA rights “as early in
the criminal justice process as is feasible and appropriate.””°?

Of greater interest, however, is the Department’s mandatory policy
regarding notification regarding crime victim services under the VRRA.
The Guidelines explain how “Department responsibilities to crime victims
begin as soon as possible after the detection of a crime at which they may
be undertaken without interfering in the investigation.”°* The Guidelines
then direct the appropriate “responsible official” to provide crime victims
with “information about services available to them.”?° This information
must be provided at “the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at
which it may be done without interfering with an investigation.”?°°

The Department appears to have little difficulty implementing this
requirement. Evidence of this fact comes from the Justice Department
itself, which responded to the letter from Senator Kyl discussed earlier
questioning why the Department was not applying the CVRA before
charges were filed.*°’ In its response, the Department noted that OLC had
issued an opinion that the CVRA did not extend rights before the formal
filing of charges.*°* “Even so,” the Department explained, “the new AG
Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make
