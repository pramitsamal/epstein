Asserting Privilege for Non-Existent Documents

It is inappropriate to assert a claim of privilege or immunity for non-existent materials.
Greenleaf v. Amerada Hess Corp., 626 So0.2d 263, 264 n.1 (Fla. 4° DCA 1993). We
must assume that the privilege is asserted for a reason, i.e., that responsive and
ostensibly privileged information in fact exists, else the privilege would not have been
asserted. It follows that a privilege log must accompany all such responses.

Claiming Undue Burden for Non-Existent Materials

Likewise, objecting on basis of burdensomeness and later conceding an opponent's right
to materials or later claiming materials do not exist constitute abusive discovery
practices. First Healthcare Corp. v. Hamilton, 740 So.2d 1189, 1194 (Fla. 4 DCA
1999).

Custody, Possession & Control

Fla. R. Civ. P. reaches all documents (broadly defined and specifically including
electronic data) in your client's custody, possession, or control. Custody and
possession are self-explanatory. Control is broader; it means the legal right to obtain,
even from nonparties. The concept of ‘control’ generally has been held to mean the legal
right to obtain the requested documents. Parties thus can be requested to produce
documents in the hands of their attorney, insurer, subsidiary, or another person outside
the jurisdiction of the court. Lawrence M. Watson, Jr. & Michael S. Orfinger, Fla.
Civil Practice Before Trial § 16.60 (1993 ed.) (citing 8 Wright & Miller, Fed. Practice
& Procedure £16-10 (1998 ed.). A recent federal court case construing Fed. R. Civ. P.
41 (on which Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.350 is patterned), explained:

The term control comprehends not only possession but also the right,
authority, or ability to obtain the documents. Accordingly, Rule 34(a)
allows a party seeking discovery to require production of documents
beyond the actual possession of the opposing party if such party has
retained any right or ability to influence the person in whose possession
the documents lie. [A] party is deemed to have control over documents
held on its behalf by its attorneys. A party is also deemed to have control
over financial records of the party that are in the possession of the party's
accountant.
