Conference tone bullish into 2017

We recently hosted over 90 public and private companies and 700 attendees at our
Future of Financials conference, where investor attendance was up an impressive 66%

generalists attending than we've seen in previous years. When asked how they would
describe their portfolio positioning in financial stocks, 60% of the investors polled noted
that they are either slightly overweight or very overweight the sector (see Chart 1).

funded with savings found elsewhere. 68% of those polled across multiple company
presentations believed that institutions should invest in innovation projects but be
mindful of self-funding (see Chart 2).
