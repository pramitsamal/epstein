Banks Takeaways

With our conference coming a week following a historic US presidential election that
helped boost bank stocks by 12%, bank management teams were generally optimistic
with regards to the economic outlook heading into 2017. Greater fiscal stimulus that is
expected to spur economic growth coupled with potential regulatory relief has helped
improve the overall sentiment in the sector. When asked what the biggest impact of the
GOP sweep would likely be to bank earnings, 35% noted tax cuts and infrastructure
spurring growth as the biggest impact.

An area that has attracted particular attention among bank investors is around the
current landscape of multifamily lending. We polled the audience around their outlook
for multifamily lending in 2017 and found that 49% of those polled said there was some
concern, but only in certain regions and at certain rental price points. Meanwhile, 29%
noted softening fundamentals that should lead to slower financing activity and
worsening credit metrics (see Chart 4).
