were underweight at the start of the year too and missed the lows. We recognized we
were wrong and closed our underweight and while it took us a while but we eventually
managed to go overweight in September. The lesson of that is that themes are great,
but when the facts change strategists and investors have to change their minds.

In fact your best guide to this year was to buy something when it has oversold,
underowned and unloved, like Miners and Emerging Markets in February, Banks in July,
the Nikkei the day of the US election and sell when the opposite e.g. bonds and
defensive equities shortly after Brexit. Our CTI models did actually pick up a number of
those events as the table below shows. It also got picked up by our standard deviation
analysis. We acted on some but not all of these readings. The lesson, with the benefit of
hindsight, is to pay more attention to them. Indeed, our recent decision to downgrade
both Banks and Basic Resources reflected very high readings on our models.

We think 2017 is another year where investors will need to be nimble. Markets have
responded enthusiastically to a prospective Trump Presidency but as the above charts
suggest we may well have discounted much of it. That is also supported by our fixed
income and FX forecasts, which suggest much has already been priced in. In addition we
have political risk starting with next weekend’s Italian referendum stretching to the
German elections in Autumn 2017. In the middle we have the crucial French elections. A
