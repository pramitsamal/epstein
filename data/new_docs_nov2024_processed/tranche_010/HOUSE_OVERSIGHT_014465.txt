Marine Le Pen victory could bring into question both the future of the EU and also the
euro, should the polls be close it could make the uncertainty and market moves around
Brexit look like a walk in the park.

2017 —- Reflation, Reversal, Rotation, Relief or Revolt?

2017 is likely to have a number of cross currents as themes. Recovery and Rotation go
hand in hand. The stronger the recovery the more yields can rise the more we can see
the rotation extend. Should investors become concerned that the recovery is stalling or
that yields are peaking the rotation would likely stall potentially even reverse. Reversal
refers to the ECB. Our economists are not yet convinced that the ECB will start to
unravel some of its easing measures in 2017 but they do expect the debate to be a
vigorous one within the ECB. For the first time Gilles Moec thinks there is a chance that
the ECB will indeed choose to taper. Relief or Revolt relates to the French election. Will
Europe follow the UK and US lead of 2016 and go down the route of populism (revolt
from the voters) or will we find relief for the markets if by the end of 2017 froma
Fillon/Merkel duo being in charge of the two largest economies in the Euro Area.

Recovery - the world looks a better place going into 2017
Reflation has been the big theme of the second half of the year. As we had noted in
previous publications there had been something of an improvement in the global growth
picture emerging even before the US election. It started with Emerging Market growth,
which our GEMScycle has been showing to be accelerating for some months, but seems
to have spread to other parts of the developing world. US GDP for Q3 has just printed a
revised 3.2%, with a number of indicators, such as ISM’s, PMI’s and consumer
confidence pointing to a solid Q4 to follow. That quarter is currently tracking at 3.6%
according to the Atlanta Fed.

The Euro Area too is showing signs of improvement with the latest manufacturing PMIs
back to their best since early 2014 with other national surveys, such as Ifo pointing in
the same direction. The composite PMI is back close to the year highs too. The UK
numbers continue to surprise on the upside too for the moment. Our economists are
also upbeat on Japan with growth expected to accelerate next year as the fiscal stimulus
kicks in.

Accordingly our economists expect growth to rise from 3% this year to 3.5% in 2017
and 3.8% in 2018. That acceleration in growth is despite a slightly slower US economy
in the first half of the year as a higher USD and interest rates dampen growth before
the fiscal stimulus kicks in. With growth firming and oil prices expected to be higher
inflation is also expected to pick up through 2017 and 2018 to 2.8% and 3%
respectively. At this stage it is worth noting that this is a modest acceleration in both
growth and inflation.
