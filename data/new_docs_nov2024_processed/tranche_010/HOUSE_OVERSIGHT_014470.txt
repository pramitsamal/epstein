ae — a return to positive EPS growth
in 201

7% EPS growth in 2017 as global growth improves and Resources EPS recovers
We think the earnings backdrop will be supportive in 2017 with a return to positive EPS
growth in Europe for the first time since 2014 and with downside to consensus
forecasts for the year ahead that are well below average. Our base case assumes +7%
EPS growth in 2017 and 2018. With EPS broadly stagnant over the last 6 years,
investors might justifiably ask what is different this time. We see several reasons to
think mid to high single digit EPS growth is achievable next year.

Return to positive EPS growth feasible with global GDP at 3.5%... First, global
growth is accelerating and on our economists’ base case forecasts global GDP growth
will be 3.5%, the first materially above trend growth year since 2010. That is significant
for European earnings given a reasonably tight relationship to global GDP growth. 3%
represents the tipping point around which earnings growth tends to turn positive
according to our regression model. At the BofAML forecast of 3.5% global GDP growth,
7% EPS growth is implied as likely by the same model.

..as leading Indicators point to a synchronized global recovery. What gives us
confidence in this putative earnings recovery is the more synchronized nature of the
current recovery. All major regions of the world are showing momentum in growth
indicators for the first time in several years. One measure of the broad nature of the
improvement is manufacturing PMI surveys. Of 29 Markit PMIs 83% are currently above
50, highest since August 2014. More importantly, 79% have improved over the last 3
months — higher than at any point in the last three years.

Bull case of global GDP towards 4% would signal double digit EPS growth. To see a
more bullish outcome for EPS we would need to see global GDP accelerating further. Based
on our regression model, double digit EPS growth historically was consistent with global GDP
growth above 3.8%. Under our bull case scenario for 2017, with say 4.0% global GDP growth,
consensus EPS growth forecasts for +14% in Europe would become realistic.

PMs beyond 55 would suggest upside to base case. Significant further gains in
leading indicators would be a signal that earnings growth could exceed our base case.
Over the longer term EPS growth has followed manufacturing PMI surveys with a 9-
month lag approximately (using an average of US and Eurozone). Historically readings
above 55 were consistent with mid-teens EPS growth. The relationship has weakened in
recent years as low interest rates and weaker commodity prices weighed on earnings in
Financials and Resources. Nevertheless, in the last year of decent EPS growth in Europe
in 2014 the PMIs peaked at 54 so we would look for upside to our base case EPS
forecast should PMIs improve to the mid-50s level or beyond.
