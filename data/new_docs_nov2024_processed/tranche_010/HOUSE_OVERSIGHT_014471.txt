Removal of the 3pp p.a. drag from Resources supports EPS outlook. Second, the

Resources sectors in 2017 will likely provide a (strongly) positive contribution to market
EPS, in turn reversing what has been the biggest headwind for several years. Over the
last 3-5 years the Resources sectors provided a 2.5 percentage point drag on annualized
market EPS growth. In 2016 Banks have been the other big drag on market earnings.
While structural headwinds to profitability mean the contribution of Banks remains open
to debate, consensus forecasts nevertheless imply a strong recovery in 2017 (driven in
part by one-offs reversing). The important point is that the market ex-Banks and

Resources has delivered modest but positive EPS growth — estimated at +5.5% for
2016. Hence, removing the drag from Oil and Mining makes high single digit growth

achievable in our view.

Margin upside, capex discipline and FX tailwind provide additional support. Third,
profit margins in Europe are not elevated: in the bottom third of the historical range
(since 2004) at the EBITDA level and about average at the net level. With some
acceleration in the top-line as global growth and inflation pick up, there is scope for
margins to improve. In addition, several years of relative capex discipline provide
potential support for margin improvement over the next 1-2 years in corporate Europe.
Over the longer term, we find that operating margins have tended to improve with a lag
of one to two years, following a period of declining capex ratios. That is encouraging for
