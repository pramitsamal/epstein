rate hikes should the economy weaken, and will

pick up the pace later in 2017 or 2018 if the

fiscal package under the Trump administration is

bigger than we expect (see Section II, 2017 Global

Economic Outlook, for a more detailed discussion).
Irrespective of the realized pace, this tightening

cycle will not result in a US recession in 2017,

in our view.

Low Expectations of a US Recession

Recessions in the US have been triggered by
Federal Reserve tightening of monetary policy; by
economic imbalances such as the bursting of the
dot-com and housing bubbles in 2000 and 2008,
respectively; or by external shocks such as the Arab
oil embargo in 1973. The first two triggers are
unlikely to occur in 2017, and the third, a shock,
is not something that we can typically anticipate.
However, we do think that China will be a

source of downside risk sometime over the next
three years.

First, as we mentioned in last year’s Outlook,
there have been five tightening cycles in the post-
WWII period that have not triggered a recession.
Four of those cycles occurred during the three
longest recoveries, as shown in Exhibit 24. Those
cycles have been characterized by an early start
to the tightening cycle, a slow pace relative to
historical averages (220 basis points per year for
nonrecessionary tightening and 330 basis points per
year in recessionary cycles), low core inflation and
slack in the labor market. This cycle shares those
characteristics: the tightening cycle started in 2015,
the pace has been 25 basis points per year, the core
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index—
the Federal Reserve’s preferred benchmark for
inflation—is at 1.6% year over year as of November
2016, and our colleagues in GIR estimate that the
labor market still has about 0.3% slack.

Second, the US economy does not
suffer from any imbalances in which one
sector of the economy has become the
sole driver of growth or equity market
returns. Before the global financial crisis,
residential investment as a percentage
of GDP had peaked at 6.7% in 2005,
compared to a long-term average of
4.7%, and the credit-to-GDP gap as a
measure of nonfinancial sector leverage
had peaked at 12.4% in 2007 compared
to a long-term average of -1%, leading
to meaningful imbalances. Similarly, in
2000, technology and telecommunication
sector valuations were more than three
standard deviations higher than the
average of other sectors. Such imbalances
do not exist in the US at this time.

Third, while we cannot anticipate an
external shock—otherwise it would not
be a shock—we do not see imbalances in
other large economies except in China.
