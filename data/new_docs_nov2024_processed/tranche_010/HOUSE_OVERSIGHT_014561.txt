Quarters After Recession Trough

Data as of December 2016.

In our 2016 Outlook and our 2016 Insight report,
Walled In: China’s Great Dilemma, we stated that
China was unlikely to have a hard landing over the
next two years (i.e., 2016 and 2017). We believe
the view still holds. We do not expect a hard
landing in China that would destabilize the US
economy in 2017, but the risks grow significantly
in 2018 and 2019. As we discuss below, China may
nevertheless represent a geopolitical risk in 2017.
Historically, since WWII, the odds of a
recession occurring over a 12-month period
have been 18%. Our composite recession model,
incorporating end-of-year financial and economic
data, estimates the probability of a recession in
2017 at 23%. Once we incorporate the likely
passage of a fiscal stimulus package of tax cuts
and infrastructure investments in the latter half
of 2017, the probability of a recession this year
declines to about 15%.

Rising Influence of Populist Parties in

the Eurozone

Since the election of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras
and the Syriza Party in Greece in January 2015,
populism has been gaining momentum across
Europe. The support for populist parties has
increased to varying degrees in Spain, Greece, Italy,
France, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.
The common themes among populists have been
anti-immigration and anti-European Union.
Outside the Eurozone, the 2016 Brexit vote in
Great Britain has been interpreted as a populist

vote against immigration from Eastern Europe, the
Middle East and North Africa, as well as against
the bureaucracy of the European Union.

The increasing enthusiasm for populist parties
in Europe raises two questions. First, will any of
the more extremist parties win enough support to
break away from the European Union? In France,
for example, upcoming elections in May 2017 are
likely to pit Francois Fillon of Les Républicains
against Marine Le Pen of the far right Front
National. Le Pen has promised a referendum on
whether France should stay in the European Union,
and, should she win, questions about the viability
of the Eurozone will surface immediately.°* While
polls show Fillon well ahead of Le Pen, polls
have been wrong on the UK and Italian referenda
and the US election. The Eurasia Group, for one,
assigns a 30% probability to a Le Pen victory.*”

Second, to what extent will the rise of populism
influence policies in the Eurozone? Here, Germany
will probably provide a litmus test. Chancellor
Angela Merkel and her coalition government are
likely to respond to recent terrorist attacks there by
proposing a stronger police and military presence,
according to the Eurasia Group. Security checks
will probably be increased as well, since at least
800,000 asylum-seekers entered Germany with
minimal security checks and terrorist suspects have
already been arrested among them.°* With German
elections scheduled for September 2017, it remains
to be seen whether Chancellor Merkel will adjust
her immigration policy.
