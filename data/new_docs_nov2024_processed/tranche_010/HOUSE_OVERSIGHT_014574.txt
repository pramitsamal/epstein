by inventory restocking, which looks ready to help
GDP growth again after five quarters of negative
contributions (see Exhibit 36). Similarly, residential
investment is set to contribute, reflected in the

National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)
housing market index reaching a post-crisis high in
December of last year (see Exhibit 37). Overall, we
expect this momentum to continue as the erstwhile
easing in financial conditions provides a growth
tailwind throughout 2017 (see Exhibit 38).

A Resilient US Consumer

The stars are aligned for US consumers in 2017,
as they enter the year with rising wages, higher
net worth from asset price gains, historically
low debt-servicing costs, ample savings and
confidence at a 12-year high. They also stand to
benefit directly from potentially lower tax rates
and indirectly from higher fiscal spending, a
topic we discuss in the next section. The above-
mentioned factors should mitigate the headwind
from higher inflation. Overall, we expect private
consumption—a key driver of our GDP forecast—
to expand at a pace of approximately 2.5%.

Supportive Policy

While government policy is always a source of
uncertainty, it is even more so in 2017 given
potential changes to tax, trade and immigration
policies in the wake of last year’s presidential
election. Nonetheless, our base case is that policy
ultimately supports growth this year, with some
fiscal expansion and a measured pace of Federal
Reserve rate hikes. Although the final contours of
