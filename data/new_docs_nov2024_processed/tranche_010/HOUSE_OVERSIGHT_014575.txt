the new administration’s policies remain uncertain,
a moderate-sized stimulus package of around
$200 billion per year seems likely.!°? While the
direct impact of such a package is estimated to
boost GDP growth by only 0.3 percentage point
in 2017, the positive indirect impact of tax cuts
and stronger anticipated GDP on household and
business confidence is arguably more important.
Indeed, both consumer and CFO confidence have
recently hit their highest readings in over a decade
(see Exhibit 39).

Our View on US Growth

As the expansion enters its eighth year, it is natural
to question its durability. But far from showing

its age, the US economy begins 2017 at an above-
trend growth pace, with little evidence of cyclical
imbalances or other excesses that typically portend
the end of the business cycle. If anything, the slow
pace of this recovery has elongated its life span, a
dynamic that is likely to persist this year. Perhaps
in macroeconomics, as in life, age is just a number.

Eurozone: Weathering the Storm
The Eurozone has faced its share of challenges in

recent years. Not only did it relapse into recession
in 2011, but it also endured a domestic sovereign

bond and banking crisis at the same time. More
recently, it has been buffeted by a spate of tragic
terrorist attacks, an immigration crisis, the Brexit
vote, a failed Italian constitutional referendum
and renewed concerns about the solvency of its
banking system.

Yet despite this onslaught of headwinds, the
real economy has been remarkably stable in the
last two years. That fact is evident in Exhibit 40,
which shows real GDP growth has sustained an
above-trend pace over this period, an outcome
that clearly exceeded consensus forecasts. Business
sentiment has remained equally steadfast over this
period, suggesting that the rapidity of shocks may
have effectively inured confidence to bad news (see
Exhibit 41). Meanwhile, real household disposable
income grew by 2.3% over the past year—the
fastest pace since 2007.

We expect this stability to persist in 2017,
with our forecast calling for 1.2-1.9% real GDP
growth. Keep in mind that there is ample scope
for above-trend growth to continue, as the level
of Eurozone GDP still stands below its potential.
On this point, the OECD, IMF and European
Commission each currently estimate an output gap
of around 2%, indicating slack in the economy.
The Eurozone’s still elevated 9.8% unemployment
rate corroborates this point.
