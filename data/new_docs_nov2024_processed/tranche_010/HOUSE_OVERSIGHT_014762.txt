SiEESS testing CNY

We stress test China’s FX reserves to capital outflows and warn of a potential
USD520bn fall in FX reserves in 2017, translating into higher CNY volatility.

« We also look at broader EM FX sensitivity to CNY depreciation and find ZAR and
RUB most vulnerable.

« We examine if bond index and MSCI inclusion could significantly offset outflows,
but are doubtful for now.

CNY - anything left in reserve?

We forecast USD/CNY to rise to 7.25 by year-end 2017 based on sustained capital
outflows from China and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) allowing the exchange rate
to depreciate accordingly. A key change in the PBoC’s new FX regime, announced in
August 2015, is to raise the influence of market forces over the exchange rate.

We showed that not all outflows are created equal. Some outflows are good and reflect
structural changes in China’s economy and liberalization of China’s financial account;
some outflows are ugly in the sense they represent illicit outflows. Yet both types of
outflows are influenced by policy uncertainty in China, which we showed can explain a
significant amount of capital outflows through Chinese purchases of overseas assets.

The impact of capital outflows alone on China’s FX reserves is negative. A decline in FX
reserves is also associated with an increase in volatility of the RMB (Chart 57). But the
negative impact on FX reserves may be offset by China’s trade balance. If China’s trade
balance and capital outflows are similar to that recorded in 2015 and 2016, then China’s
FX reserves would be between USD 2,600bn and USD 2,900bn in 2017. This represents
a fall of USD520-220bn given current FX reserves of USD3,120bn and would amount to
China having diminished control over its currency and higher CNY volatility - assuming
no dramatic changes to capital controls.
