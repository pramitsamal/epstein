Table 5, above, shows a scenario analysis of China’s FX reserves in 2017 under different
trade balance and capital outflows. The analysis makes two assumptions. The first
assumption is all the changes in the Balance of Payment’s (BoP) reserve assets are
reflected in the headline FX reserves figure. The second assumption is that the income
balance is USD -36bn, which was derived from the annual rate since 2015.

We believe a decline of FX reserves to USD 2,600bn to USD 2,900bn would only be a
problem for China if it attempted to implement a “fixed exchange rate” without capital
controls. Such an FX regime requires heavy FX intervention and would put downward
pressure on its FX reserves, making this FX regime choice no longer tenable for China.

The IMF’s framework for calculating adequate FX reserves is based on whether there
are capital controls and whether the currency operates on a fixed or floating exchange
rate regime (Table 6). The latest readings show a fixed exchange rate regime without
capital controls in China would require USD 2,91 1bn of FX reserves, which probably
won't be achieved, as shown in Table 1. Meanwhile, a floating exchange rate regime
with no capital controls would require USD 1,618bn of FX reserves. Fewer FX reserves
would be needed to manage a floating currency that would adjust freely to capital flows.
This reinforces the view that the CNY is moving toward a more flexible FX regime as its
FX reserves are depleted (barring a draconian step capital control measures).

Skeptics may counter that China could always ratchet up capital controls to reassert
control over its currency. However, the efficacy of this is questionable. The experience
of 2016 shows that in spite of more capital controls introduced in late 2015 (e.g.,
onshore window guidance restricting the sale of FX by onshore banks) capital outflows
have continued along with FX reserve depletion, albeit at a slower pace. Ultimately, this
means China’s ability to exert control over the CNY is being eroded, while the risk of
more CNY volatility is rising. This is our scenario for 2017, with the tail risk that “ugly
flows” or illicit capital flight due to domestic financial stability concerns could drive
sharper CNY depreciation and FX reserve depletion. It is under this tail risk scenario that
the temptation for draconian capital controls becomes a danger. For this reason, we
believe it will be important to monitor the nature of the capital outflow and not just the
size of the outflow. Good outflow such as Overseas Direct Investment by state-owned
