Technical trends for Trump
¢ Bullish USD: Breadth and technicals favor USD. Overall they point to a stronger US
dollar in 2017. We are bullish USD/JPY.

¢ Higher yields: US 10y and 30y yield made large wedge bottom patterns, pointing to
a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of 2.98% and 3.80%, respectively.

e Werecommend buying a NZD/USD 5m .69/.66 put spread 1x1.5 for 43 USD pips
(off of .7100 spot).

USD rally is turning Into an outright bull

The Bloomberg US dollar index is approaching all-time highs. The number of USD
crosses above their 200-day moving average has broken out higher. The number of USD
crosses reaching overbought on RSI (bullish momentum) continues to rise. The USD
cumulative advance-decline line recently signaled for tactical USD strength and would
turn outright bullish with a trend line break and new index highs.
