The Fed turns more hawkish, though vol remains subdued

Last week, unsurprisingly the Fed opted to hike benchmark rates another 25bps.
However, the market was more focused on the FOMC’s unexpectedly hawkish message,
which indicated that it is willing to normalize policy despite weaker-than-desired
inflation. Qur economists now think the Fed will announce balance sheet normalization
in September and will hike rates again in December. A more hawkish Fed could result in
higher real rates and a stronger USD, which ultimately should benefit our Growth to

500 was more-or-less flat week-over-week as it gained only 6bps. The tech selloff
continued, however, and the Nasdaq-100 dropped 105bps. Similarly, the Russell 2000
also dropped 105bps. Despite concerns on the Fed, the VIX fell 0.32 vol points to 10.38,

and SPX 1m ATM implied vol declined 0.3 vol points to 7.6%.

On June 9, the Nasdaq dropped nearly 2% as investors unwound
crowded positions, resulting in a sudden selloff from a period of
relative calm. However, despite the volatility among tech names
during the first week of June, the Nasdaq (CCMP} has not seen a
5% drawdown from a prior peak (using closing data} in 150
days. This is the longest such streak in the Nasdaq’s history.

Prior to today, the longest periods of similar calm occurred
during July ’83 and July ’86, when the index did not record a 5%
drawdown from a peak in 136 and 135 days respectively.

Last week the S&P 500 recorded its 11 session without a
move larger than 0.5% in either direction. As a result, 10d
realized vol stood at 3.31% as of 16-Jun.

This is already the fourth time this year that SPX has gone more
than 10 consecutive days without a move greater than +/- 0.5%.
This has historically happened only in ’64, ’65 and ’52. The
longest such stretch this year lasted 15 consecutive trading
sessions and ended on 16-May. For comparison, in ’64 SPX had
8 stretches without such a move with the longest stretch
spanning 43 days.
