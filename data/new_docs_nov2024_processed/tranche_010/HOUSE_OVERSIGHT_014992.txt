Rationale

Investors should re-assess attractiveness of popular and {typically} technically motivated longer-
dated RV vol trades, given environment of structurally higher political & economic risks and
increasingly limited policy options

Cheap equity upside in a bond / equity melt-up

Risks of a hard Brexit rising and (weak) currency tailwind likely to prove short-lived; position
cheaply for FTSE 100 (UKX) underperformance

Remain long equities and cheapen hedges by conditioning on rates

China risk premium rising but A-shares vol still at all-time lows
Equity-FX correlation is not priced for a spillover of populism into the EU, which could cause EUR
0 fall against an already weakened GBP as equities fall

UKX is heavily exposed to EU (50% revenues) and should underperform SPX if GBP tailwind
ades. Volatility & correlation suit well for outperformance

Cheapen long XLF upside to near 8y lows via selling upside on structurally challenged European
banks & relatively more bearish outlook for US rates vs EU

USDJPY and NKY the biggest beneficiaries of a Trump win

Banks and Insurance are the most leveraged sector

Banks and Insurance are the most leveraged sector

China risk premium rising but A-shares vol still at all-time lows

Own contrarian EM upside at low cost & limited risk

QE uncertainty and USDJPY vol support NKY vs SPX realized vol

What if QE hits its limit? Long NKY vol outright which is cheap to carry

With fiscal stimulus and potential tax cuts, small caps revert to old normal generating higher vol
on upside and downside relative to large caps

Vol and price technicals are attractive. BofAML commodity strategists oil target is $70/bbl but this
is already priced in SXEP levels according to BofAML Oil & Gas equity analysts

Position for a near-term wobble followed by yet another equity melt up

Cheaply access positive carry QE failure hedge

Position for a pick-up in single stock realised vol on the 10 names (within FTSE’s top 30} where
post EU referendum realised vol was the highest relative to current 1y ATMf vol. The 10 names
are: Barclays, Aviva, Prudential, BT, Glencore, Tesco, CRH, BA, Standard Chartered & HSBC.

Hedge portfolios against a buy-the-dip failure should a faster rate cycle ultimately jeopardize it

he MSCI inclusion theme; Hedge with 2823 HK Jun17 95% put

Market may trade on the MSCI inclusion theme; Hedge with 2823 HK Jun17 95% put
Historically attractive to own TOPIX Top 10 corridor gamma weighted volatility dispersion
Hedge a rollover in China GDP and screen for cyclicals that could face pressure

Hedge a rollover in China GDP and screen for cyclicals that could face pressure

Benefit from low vol, flat correl, likely hawkish ECB & (FX un-hedged) inflows into EU equities
Leverage inexpensive equity vs. FX vols to own cheap tail protection

Buy inexpensive EM equity puts on near-record performance gap to commodities

Monetise low vol & high implied correl to position for greater sector dispersion in EU: long basket
call, short worst-of call

Own inexpensive NKY hedges into FOMC; Term structure is too steep is under-pricing risks
Buy out-of-favour and inexpensive biotech upside by levering depressed vol & skew

Market may trade on

Buy EEM puts financed by a basket of EM puts to lever near record low correl

Hedge a potential China tech bubble; Tencent potentially volatile after a 45% rally YTD

Hedge the upside into MSCI announcement on 20-Jun

Fundamental case to be long EU equities remains intact but stretched bullish positioning could
lead to near-term consolidation
BofAML Equity & Credit strategists highlight they favour equities over HY credit as div yields have
surpassed HY credit yield & equities o

er more gearing to rising PMI's, earnings and FCF
