A Child’ s Primer on Fighting Communism

Now we are going to have some fun fighting Communism. Let us

play a game of Make Believe. Close your eyes and concentrate. We are
going to pretend that Red China doesn’ t exist. They are the Bad Guys.
Because they make people slaves.

Nationalist China is different. They are the Good Guys. There,
hundreds of thousands of little unwanted children are sold. They work in
coal mines. Then they are wanted. The older girls work in brothels. How
nice to be so wanted. Open your eyes now. Anyone around our base is /¢.

Fidel Castro says Cuba is a socialist state. That proves they are
Communists. But we knew it before. You could tell by the way Castro and
Khrushchev hugged each other. So we stopped buying sugar from Cuba.
Now other countries buy sugar from Cuba.

Iran has bought 10,000 tons of sugar from Cuba. Iran gets a lot of
economic and military aid from us. So we are helping Cuba anyway. Maybe
we should trade tractors for prisoners then. But we will fool them. We will

put treads on all the old Edsels that didn’ t sell.
