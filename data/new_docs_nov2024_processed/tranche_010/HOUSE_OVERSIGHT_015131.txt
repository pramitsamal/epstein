about the murder of President Kennedy. Haldeman said that Nixon always
referred to the assassination as “the Bay of Pigs.” And, on May 5, 1977,
the Houston Post published a UPI dispatch that stated:

“Watergate burglar Frank Sturgis said Wednesday that the CIA
planned the break-in because high officials felt Richard Nixon was
becoming too powerful and was overly interested in the assassination of
John Kennedy... ‘Several times the President asked CIA director Richard
Helms for the files on the Kennedy assassination, but Helms refused to
give them to him, refused a direct order from the President,’ Sturgis said.

‘| believe Nixon would have uncovered the true facts in the assassination
of President Kennedy and that would have taken off the heat in Watergate.
Because Nixon wanted files, the CIA felt they had to get rid of him.’
Asked if Nixon ever was in danger, Sturgis replied, ‘Yes, absolutely. Nixon
was lucky he wasn’ t killed—assassinated like President Kennedy.’ ”

One other thing. “A Sneak Preview of Richard Nixon’ s Memoir
was originally published in 1976, in which Nixon insisted that Watergate
was a set-up to get rid of him as president. About a decade later, Tricky
Dick made that exact same claim on a network television interview.

Satirical prophecy in action.
