In his new book, Bob Woodward writes about Colin Powell’ s status
as an adviser to you. Referring to his previous book, Plan of Attack, the
New York Times then reported that “Secretary of State Colin Powell
disputed Woodward’ s account....He said that he had an excellent
relationship with Vice President Dick Cheney, and that he did not recall
referring to officials at the Pentagon loyal to Cheney as the ‘Gestapo
office.’  Who among us would be unable to recall uttering such an
epithet? Powell later apologized for it. He has also changed his mind about
gays in the military. In my capacity as a stand-up satirist, | used to conduct
an imaginary dialogue with Powell.

“General Powell, you’ re the first African-American to be head of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and you come from the tradition of a military
family. So you know that blacks were once segregated in the Army
because the other soldiers might feel uncomfortable if blacks slept in the
same barracks. And now that’ s what they say about gays, that other
soldiers might feel uncomfortable about gays sleeping in the same
barracks.”

“Well, you have to understand, we never fto/d anybody we were

black.”
