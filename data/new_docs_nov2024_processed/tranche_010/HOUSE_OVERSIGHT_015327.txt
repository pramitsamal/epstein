And, Mr. President, that was the forerunner of the same “Don’ t
ask, don’ t tell” policy that you promised to rescind, only you haven’ t
been acting like a Commander-in-Chief. All you have to do is sign such a
directive. Those who serve in the military are trained to follow orders. If
they can follow orders to kill fellow humans, they can certainly follow
orders to treat openly gay service people with total equality.

Not only is the current guideline counterproductive, but also this
display of trickle-down immorality must, on some level of consciousness,
serve as a contributing factor to enabling the anti-gay bullying and
torturing of innocent victims. | know, you don’ t want to take a chance
that retracting the policy would interfere with your re-election. You’ ve
made the point that you don’ t want Mitt Romney to win in 2012 and turn
around all the good things you’ ve accomplished.

Incidentally, Romney had wanted to overturn Roe vs. Wade, yet, in
1994, when he was running for the Senate, he came out in favor of choice
for women. However, freelance journalist Suzan Mazur revealed that he
admitted to Mormon feminist Judith Dushku that “the Brethren” in Salt
Lake City to/d him he could take a pro-choice position, and that in fact he
probably had to in order to win in a liberal state like Massachusetts.

Pandering trumps religious belief.
