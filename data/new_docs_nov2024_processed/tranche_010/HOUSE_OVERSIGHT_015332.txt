that “The nightmare in Tucson is the inevitable result of a society where a
mentally confused young man can purchase a red G-string anywhere at

Speaking of lowering the temperature, in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, editorial cartoonist Rob Rogers depicted the U.S. Civil Discourse
Gun Shop where a customer is asking the clerk: “Do you have anything
versatile enough to go from a campaign breakfast to a protest march to a
Town Hall meeting?” And in the Orlando Sentinal Dana Summers
depicted another gun store featuring semi-automatic 31-clip weapons,
where the clerk is explaining to a customer: “Say you have thirty-one
burglars break into your house.”

On the Monday following the tragic weekend, Jon Stewart was
unable to find anything funny about it. Nor was Stephen Colbert, although
he did present a montage of news clips with various explanations of
Loughner’ s behavior, and the final one, from Fox News— “He is also
being described as a left-wing political pothead” —managed to evoke
laughter from the audience. And Rush Limbaugh called him a “marijuana

junkie.”
