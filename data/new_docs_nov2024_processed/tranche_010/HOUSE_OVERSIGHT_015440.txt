The Six Dumbest Decisions of My Life

I' m talking here about seriously dumb decisions, not those minor
regrets like that time in 1970 when £squire magazine assigned me to fly to
New Mexico where director Monte Hellman was filming 7wo-Lane
Blacktop, about street-racing. Among the actors was a pair of musicians,
James Taylor as a driver, and Dennis Wilson as a mechanic. They both
agreed to be interviewed, besides screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer and others.

During a conversation with Taylor about not laughing at jokes, he
said, “My brother once told me a joke that made me laugh.”

“Wait, don’ t tell me now,” | said. “Let’ s save it for the
interview.”

However, | was supposed to reveal behind the scenes of making the
movie, but | learned that there were a couple of violations of law: A few
members of the cast had been tripping on magic mushrooms; and a 17-
year-old actress, Laurie Bird, who played “The Girl,” had sex with two
members of the crew. Nine years later she would commit suicide.

Anyway, | decided not to write the article--| was a reporter, not a
snitch--and never did get a chance to do any interviews. Nor did | ever

hear the joke that James Taylor’ s brother told him and made him laugh. |
