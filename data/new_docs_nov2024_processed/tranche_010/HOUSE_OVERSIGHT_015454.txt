In 1987, | was a keynote speaker at the annual International Society
for Humor Studies conference, held in Tempe, Arizona. | had dinner with a
group of five staffers from the Russian humor magazine Krokodii/ at the
Holiday Inn. They all ordered the specialty of the house—pork ribs—which
came with huge bibs. The editor was given a bib with the words “Miss
America” on it. The art director got a bib with a big iconic “S for

Superman.

They were really getting a dose of our culture. As we walked along
the salad bar, one of the Russians stopped at the corn chowder and asked
me, “Is this typical American soup?” As the others gathered around, |
didn’ t quite know how to answer. “I’ m sorry, | don’ t know, | said.

“I’m sure it’ s typical somewherein the country.” And then |
remembered that multi-tasking man at the airport urinal. “In America,” |
told the Russian, “corn chowder comes with dental floss that has little
pieces of corn embedded in it, so if you get hungry between meals you

can floss and have a snack at the same time.”
