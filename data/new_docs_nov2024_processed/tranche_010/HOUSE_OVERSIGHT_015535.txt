Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 5 of 12

21. To avoid her deposition, Maxwell claimed that her mother fell deathly ill and that
consequently she was leaving the United States for London with no plans of ever returning. In
fact, however, within weeks of using that excuse to avoid testifying, Maxwell had returned to
New York.

22. In 2011, two FBI agents located Giuffre in Australia—where she had been hiding
from Epstein and Maxwell for several years—and arranged to meet with her at the US.
Consulate in Sidney. Guuffre provided truthful and accurate information to the FBI about
Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual abuse.

23. | Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Giuffre believed that
she should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who had also
suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse.

24. On December 23, 2014, Giuffre incorporated an organization called Victims
Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation.

25. Giuffre intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against
sexual abuse and human trafficking. The goal of her organization was, and continues to be, to
help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of
sexual abuse. Giuffre has now dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex
trafficking.

26. On December 30, 2014, Giuffre moved to join the on-going litigation previously
filed by Jane Doe 1 in the Southern District of Florida challenging Epstein’s non-prosecution

agreement by filing her own joinder motion.
