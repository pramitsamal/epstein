Kasparov versus Deep Blue

“The Three Laws of Robotics:

1. A robot may not injure a
human being or, through
inaction, allow a human
being to come to harm;

2. A robot must obey the orders
given it by humanbeings
except where such orders
would conflict with the First
Law;

3. A robot must protect its own
existence as long as such
protection does not conflict
with the First or Second Law.
The Zeroth Law: A robot may
not harm humanity, or, by
inaction, allow humanity to
come to harm.”

Isaac Asimov, I, Robot
