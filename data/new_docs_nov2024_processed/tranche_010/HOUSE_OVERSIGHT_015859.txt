Complexity & Chaos

running any algorithm can solve, and then
there are the free will problems: how do
we pick a problem in the first place? How
do inventors come up with problems no
one had ever thought to solve in the first
place, such as the invention of the Rubik’s
Cube?

I know that I don’t know either way.

I have not thought to ask that question yet.
