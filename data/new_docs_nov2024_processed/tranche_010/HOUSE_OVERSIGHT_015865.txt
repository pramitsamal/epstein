Complexity & Chaos 175

prepared to call ourselves animals, so should the little creatures which
emerge within the game. We simply emerged in a similar but slightly
more complex game.

This proposal would mean our Universe is entirely deterministic,
our lives the result of a gigantic computer program that we live within
and form part of. Chaos might make it impossible to predict the future
without running the program and watching what happened, but the
results would be inevitable, set in motion at the dawn of time. There is
no place for free will in such a Universe, no place for reason. The world
would simply be.

But a strange idea will come to our aid to show us the limits of
computation and allow us to question whether we live in a predetermined
world. This idea is Aleph 1 - something larger than infinity. And it is
infinity we will explore next.
