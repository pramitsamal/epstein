Codes

Everyone has played with some sort of
secret code as a child — the Aggy Waggy
game, passing notes written in invisible
ink made from lemon juice, or perhaps
a simple cypher. If I want to send you a
secret message, I can use a substitution
code. Let’s see how good a code breaker
you are. Can you decode this?

It’s really easy. You might guess the
message from the pattern of letters and
your knowledge of my writing style. There are a couple of interesting
patterns to note: the 3“ and 4 letter of the first word are the same and
the first and last letter of the second word are the same. As a test I gave
this code to my wife and my eight-year-old daughter to see how long it
took them to decode... Less than a minute for my wife — a linguist. We
will come back to my daughter shortly!

Roman Emperors used this sort of simple code to secure their
messages, but modern codes have to be a great deal more sophisticated.
Let us use a progressive cipher where we vary the substitution using a
secret word. Take the name of my dog and write it down repeatedly next
to the letters of the message you want to keep secret. Now translate all
the letters in the message and the code into numbers ‘a = 1, ‘b = 2 and
so on. Then add the letters of my dog’s name to the letters of the message
one at a time. If I get to 26 (‘z’) just wrap around to ‘a and carry on. This
is called modulo arithmetic. This coding scheme will translate T to ‘a the
first time but ‘T to ‘c the second making it much harder for a linguist to
see any pattern.
