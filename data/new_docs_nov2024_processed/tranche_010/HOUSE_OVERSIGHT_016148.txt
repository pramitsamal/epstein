come to an end, while the scale of any Iraqi long-term output increase remains the
biggest uncertainty.

Saudi plans to keep capacity flat add to medium term tightness

Saudi Arabia has 12.5mn bpd of crude production capacity, according to the
government, and the country suggested within the NTP that it plans to maintain
capacity at the current level to 2020. Saudi Arabia is the only material holder of spare
crude oil production capacity around the world. Spare capacity currently sits at c2mn
bpd, which is one of the lowest levels ever. Even if Saudi Arabia did start investing
today, it would take a number of years to be completed and would unlikely be ready
before 2020 in any case. Hence, as Saudi ramps up production over the medium-term by
digging into its spare capacity, the risk premium in the oil market will rise as the market
becomes increasingly less able to handle future supply disruptions.

If Saudi gas production gets off the ground, it could crowd out oil demand...

The Saudi NTP plans to grow domestic gas production by 50% to 18 bcf/d by 2020, and
to use most of this gas to meet a 30% rise in domestic power demand and moreover
boost gas’ share in power generation to 70%, up from 50% currently. This implies that
oil burned for power generation could drop by 30% or 300 thousand bpd by 2020, most
of which would likely be crude which is more valuable in the export market than the
