residual fuel oil burned. Saudi Arabia has the world’s 4 largest gas reserves, yet
reaching the 5.8 bcf/d production growth target by 2020 is not that straight forward.

..though boosting gas production to the NTP target poses significant challenges
The new Wasit project, which is due to come online in 2016 and ramp up to 2.5 bcf/d by
2020, meets about 40% of the gas production growth target. Other than that, Saudi
Arabia is focusing on getting unconventional production off the ground to meet the
remaining 3.3 bcf/d of the production growth target. The timing, cost and commercial
feasibly of which this unconventional gas is highly uncertain. The 2.5 bcf/d from the
Wasit project is about the amount of gas that would be needed to meet incremental
power demand and displace 300 thousand bpd of crude burn, assuming gas demand
does not grow in other sectors, which is unlikely. Hence, it is likely that Saudi’s ability to
switch significantly to reduce oil burn in power generation to 2020 will be quite limited,
explaining the new openness to consider gas imports, in our view.

Chart 42: Oil burned for power generation could drop by 30% or 300 Chart 43: Other sectors like petrochemicals and industry will see their
thousand bpd by 2020, most of which would likely be crude gas demand grow as well

More clarity required, but high level benefits becoming evident
The recent National Transformation Program (NTP) document provided a much awaited
articulated roadmap through 2020 of how the government is seeking to achieve its
highly ambitious Vision. However, we believe significantly more detail is still required
before the market can make more concrete conclusions on the key winners and losers
from the program as well as quantify the impact it could have on corporate earnings
(both positive and negative).
Whilst at this juncture it is difficult to quantify the size of the NTP opportunity for
individual companies, we feel more confident in highlighting the sectors that we see
could benefit from Saudi Arabia ambitious plans. We have detailed the sectors that we
see as likely benefiting most in the table below. We also highlight the sectors which
could face the most negative impact from the roll out of the NTP.
