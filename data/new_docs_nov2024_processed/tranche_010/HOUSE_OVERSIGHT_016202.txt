Case 1:19-cv-03377-LAP Document 36-4 Filed 07/03/19 Page 6 of 6

while I did not know Ms. McCawley before our contact in this case, I have since learned of her
tremendous devotion to her clients and her admirable motivation to insure that victims of sexual
abuse receive effective legal representation when attacks on their credibility are made.

Conclusion
55. In light of all these facts, I believe that Mr. Dershowitz’s bar complaint against Mr.
Boies and Ms. McCawley is frivolous. The foregoing statements are my personal statements and
are not an institutional position of the University of Utah. I request that this information be
treated confidentially by the Florida Bar and not disseminated outside of the Bar (and those

involved in this proceeding) in order to avoid any argument that I have somehow defamed
anyone.

I declare that the foregoing statements are all true the best of my information and belief,
and I make these statements under penalty of perjury.

Sincerely,

~t sei, gq.
