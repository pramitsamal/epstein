“I was surprised at how quickly it snowballed. I thought at some point there
would be a last interview, but the next victim would supply me with three or four
more names and the next one had three or four names and it just kept getting
bigger and bigger,” Recarey said.

By then, word had gotten back to Epstein from some of the girls that they had
been questioned by police. Epstein hired famed lawyer Alan Dershowitz.

“Alan Dershowitz flew down and met privately with Krischer,”’ Recarey said. “And
the shenanigans that happened, I don’t think I’ve ever seen or heard of before.”

Police reports show that Epstein’s private investigators attempted to conduct
interviews while posing as cops; that they picked through Reiter’s trash in search
of dirt to discredit him; and that the private investigators were accused of
following the girls and their families. In one case, the father of one girl claimed
he had been run off the road by a private investigator, police and court reports
show.

federal court in New York to access sealed documents in the reporting of Perversion of Justice. The Herald
also tracked down more than 60 women who said they were victims, some of whom had never spoken of the

Several of the girls said they felt intimidated and frightened by Epstein and Sarah
Kellen, the millionaire’s assistant and alleged scheduler of massages, who warned
them not to talk to police, according to the police report.

Dershowitz, in an interview with the Herald, said he had nothing to do with
gathering background on the girls — or in directing anyone to follow the police, or
the girls and their families.
