Fig. S6. Frequency distribution of words in the dictionary. We compute the frequency in our year 2000
lexicon for all 116,156 words (1-grams) in the AHD (year 2000). We represent the percentage of these
words whose frequency is smaller than the value on the x-axis (logarithmic scale, base 10). 90% of all
words in AHD are more frequent than 1 part per billion (10°), but only 75% are more frequent than 1
part per 100 million (10°).
