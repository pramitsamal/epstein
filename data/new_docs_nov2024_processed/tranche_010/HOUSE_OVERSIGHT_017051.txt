Fig. $12. Filtering out names with trajectories that cannot be resolved. Illustrates the requirement for
query name filtration on the basis of premature fame. Fame a birth is the average fame in a 10 year

window around birth, lifetime fame is the average fame from year of birth to 2000. The dashed line in
(A), (D) indicates the separatrix used to excluded query names with premature fame signals. Points to
the right were rejected from further analysis. In (B), (C), (E), (F) the black line indicates the year of birth

of the individuals whose fame trajectories are plotted.
