2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, #849

Discussions about the Amendment began again soon after the 2000 presidential elections. On April 15, 2002, Senators Kyl and
Feinstein reintroduced the Amendment in the Senate, 7? and the following day, President Bush announced his support. °° On
May 1, [*850] 2002, a companion measure was proposed in the House. ®! On January 7, 2003, Senators Kyl and Feinstein
proposed the amendment as Senate Judiciary Resolution 1. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings in April of that year,
82 followed by a written report supporting the Amendment. *> Shortly thereafter, a motion to proceed to consideration of the
measure was withdrawn when proponents determined they did not have the sixty-seven votes necessary to pass the
amendment. After it became clear that the necessary super-majority votes to amend the Constitution were not attainable,
victims’ advocates turned their attention to enacting a comprehensive victims’ rights statute.

C. The Crime Victims’ Rights Act

The Crime Victims’ Rights Act ultimately resulted from a decision by the victims’ movement to seek a more comprehensive
and enforceable federal statute rather than to continue pursuing the more ambitious goal of a federal constitutional amendment.
In April 2004, victims advocates met with Senators Kyl and Feinstein to decide whether to push yet again for a federal
constitutional amendment. Conceding that the amendment had only majority support in Congress rather than the necessary
super-majority, the advocates decided to press for a far-reaching federal statute protecting victims' rights in the federal criminal
justice system. 54 In exchange for backing off from the federal amendment in the short term, victims’ advocates received near-
universal congressional support for a broad and encompassing statutory victims’ bill of rights. 8° This new approach not only
established a string of victims' rights but also provided funding for victims’ legal services and created remedies for the violation
of victims' rights. 8° The victims' [*851] movement is currently evaluating the success of the statute before deciding whether
to continue pushing for a federal amendment. */

The Crime Victims' Rights Act gives victims the right to participate in the system. °° To facilitate such participation, the Act
grants victims eight specific rights:

(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused;

(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the
crime or of any release or escape of the accused;

(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing
evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that
proceeding;
