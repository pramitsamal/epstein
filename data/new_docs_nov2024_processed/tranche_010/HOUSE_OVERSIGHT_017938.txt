Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 4 of 28

10. In December 2014, Roberts, who had not initially been part of the CVRA action,
was asked to, and did, provide information to Plaintiffs’ counsel in the CVRA case in which she
discussed her sex trafficking by Epstein. On December 31, 2014, Plaintiffs counsel in the
CVRA proceeding (Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell) filed a Motion Pursuant to Rule 21 for
Joinder in the Action (“Joinder Motion”) on behalf of Roberts. Ms. Roberts’s joinder motion
described how she had been sexually trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and was forced to have sex
with, among others, Alan Dershowitz.

11. Based on Plaintiff’s December 2014 filing, Dershowitz, as he had previously done
to Epstein’s victims, publically and viciously attacked plaintiff's counsel in the CVRA actions,
Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell. Dershowitz, in nationally televised news interviews, wrongfully
claimed that Edwards and Cassell had engaged in unethical behavior warranting disbarment for
filing the Joinder Motion that described Dershowitz’s involvement with Epstein and Roberts.
Edwards, who is a prominent attorney for sexually abused women and children, and Cassell who
is a former United States District Court judge who left the bench to advocate for criminal
victims, sued Dershowitz for defamation. Edwards and Cassell asserted that the factual
allegations that Dershowitz had knowledge of and participated in Epstein’s criminal conduct
were entirely proper and well founded and that Dershowitz’s statements about Edwards and
Cassell were defamatory.

12. ‘In April 2016 Dershowitz settled the Edwards and Cassell defamation claims
against him. As a condition of the settlement, Dershowitz required that the financial terms of the
settlement be kept confidential.
