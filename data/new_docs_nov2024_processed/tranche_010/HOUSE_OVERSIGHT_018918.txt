| After long probe,
billionaire faces
solicitation charge

By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein
paid to have underage girls and young
women brought to his home, where he re-
ceived massages and sometimes sex, ac-
cording to an investigation p—a_
by the Palm Beach Police
Department.

Palm Beach police spent
months sifting through Ep-
stein’s trash and watching
his waterfront home and
Palm Beach International
Airport to keep tabs on his “
private jet. An indictment Epstein
charging Epstein, 53, was
unsealed Monday, charging him with one
count of felony solicitation of prostitution.

Palm Beach police thought there was
probable cause to charge Epstein with un-
lawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and
lascivious molestation.

Police Chief Michael Reiter was so angry

| with State Attorney Barry Krischer’s han-
dling of the case that he wrote a memo
