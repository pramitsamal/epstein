Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion. Inside, hidden cameras

trolled two rooms, while the girls came and went.

For the police detectives
who sifted through the gar-
bage outside and kept

lair of a troubling target.

Epstein, one of the most
mysterious of the country’s
mega-rich, was known as
much for his secrecy as for
his love of fine things: mag-

beautiful women, friendships
with the world’s elite.

headquarters, he was be-
coming known for something

else: the regular arrival of
teenage girls he hired to give
him massages and, police

from most sexual abuse sus-

erful. He counted among his
friends former President Bill
Clinton, Donald Trump and
Prince Andrew, along with
some of the most prominent
legal, scientific and business
minds in the country.
