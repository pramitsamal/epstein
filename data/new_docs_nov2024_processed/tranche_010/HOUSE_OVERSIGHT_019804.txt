® Tied to Times Reporter,” New York Times, Jan. 26, 2015. The notable exception ®
to the policy of seeking imprisonment of intelligence workers found guilty of
passing classified information to journalists is the extraordinary case of the ex-
CIA director General David Petraeus. Petraeus had given classified information
from his personal notebooks to his mistress and biographer, Paula Broadwell.
Although none of this information appeared in her 2012 biography, All In: The
Education of Davis Petraeus, he had violated his oath to protect this informa-
tion. Yet in a 2014 deal with the Justice Department, Petraeus was allowed to
plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge and sentenced to two years’ probation and
a $100,000 fine. See Eli Lake, “Petraeus, Justice, and Washington’s Culture of
Leaks,” Bloomberg View, March 4, 2015.
