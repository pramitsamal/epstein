BANNON REDUX

annon was back, according to the Bannon faction. According to Bannon himself:
B “Pm good. I’m good. I’m back. I said don’t do it. You don’t fire the director of the
FBI. The geniuses around here thought otherwise.”

Was Bannon back? asked the worried other side of the house—Jared and Ivanka, Dina
Powell, Gary Cohn, Hope Hicks, H. R. McMaster.

If he was back, that meant he had successfully defied the organizational premise of the
Trump White House: the family would always prevail. Steve Bannon had, even in his
internal exile, not stopped his running public verbal assault on Jared and Ivanka. Off the
record became Bannon’s effective on the record. These were bitter, sometimes hilarious,
denunciations of the couple’s acumen, intelligence, and motives: “They think they’re
defending him, but they are always defending themselves.”

Now he declared they were finished as a power center—destroyed. And if not, they
would destroy the president with their terrible and self-serving advice. Even worse than
Jared was Ivanka. “She was a nonevent on the campaign. She became a White House
staffer and that’s when people suddenly realized she’s dumb as a brick. A little marketing
savvy and has a look, but as far as understanding actually how the world works and what
politics is and what it means—nothing. Once you expose that, you lose such credibility.
Jared just kind of flits in and does the Arab stuff.”

The folks on the Jarvanka side seemed more and more genuinely afraid of what might
happen if they crossed the Bannon side. Because the Bannonites, they truly seemed to
fear, were assassins.

On the flight to Riyadh, Dina Powell approached Bannon about a leak involving her to
a right-wing news site. She told him she knew the leak had come from Julia Hahn, one of
Bannon’s people and a former Breitbart writer.

“You should take it up with her,” said an amused Bannon. “But she’s a beast. And she
will come at you. Let me know how it works out.”
