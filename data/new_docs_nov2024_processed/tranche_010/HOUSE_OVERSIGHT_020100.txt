candidates were Powell and Cohn, the Jarvanka favorites; OMB director Mick Mulvaney,
one of the Bannon picks; and Kelly.

In fact, Kelly—who would soon abjectly apologize to Priebus for the basic lack of
courtesy in the way his dismissal was handled—had not been consulted about his
appointment. The president’s tweet was the first he knew of it.

But indeed there was no time to waste. Now the paramount issue before the Trump
government was that somebody would have to fire Scaramucci. Since Scaramucci had
effectively gotten rid of Priebus—the person who logically should have fired him—the
new chief of staff was needed, more or less immediately, to get rid of the Mooch.

And six days later, just hours after he was sworn in, Kelly fired Scaramucci.

Chastened themselves, the junior first couple, the geniuses of the Scaramucci hire,
panicked that they would, deservedly, catch the blame for one of the most ludicrous if not
catastrophic hires in modern White House history. Now they rushed to say how firmly
they supported the decision to get rid of Scaramucci.

“So I punch you in the face,” Sean Spicer noted from the sidelines, “and then say, ‘Oh
my god, we’ve got to get you to a hospital!’ ”
