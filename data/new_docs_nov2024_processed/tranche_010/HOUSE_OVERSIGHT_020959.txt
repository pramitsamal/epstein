Matching Expenses & Revenue:

Imperatives & Constraints

There are many constraints to making changes

— ~90 million citizens (29% of Americans)’ have grown accustomed to entitlement
programs - 47MM on Medicaid, 45MM on Medicare, and 51MM on Social
Security, and many of them vote.

— Politicians depend on re-election campaigns, which can create conflicts,
especially given that only 12% of the population are willing to cut Social Security
and Medicare benefits, per Pew survey in 2/11.

— Low personal savings rates (near 6% of disposable income in CQ2:10), high
unemployment (near 10%) and economic uncertainty, which can limit ability to
make radical change.

- 14 million healthcare-related workers? have grown accustomed to relatively high
healthcare spending.

And Then There’s the Constraint of

USA Inc.’s Weak Economy

[The] typical error most countries make coming out of a
financial crisis is they shift too quickly to premature restraint.
You saw that in the United States in the 30s, you saw that in
Japan in the 90s. It is very important for us to avoid that
mistake. If the government does nothing going forward, then
the impact of policy in Washington will shift from supporting
economic growth to hurting economic growth.

Timothy Geithner, Secretary of US Treasury
