Note: Medicaid funding is appropriated by Congress (from general tax revenue) on an as-needed basis every year, therefore,

there is no need to maintain a contingency reserve, and, unlike Medicare, the “financial status” of the program is not in question

from an actuarial perspective. Here we estimated the net present value of future Medicaid spending through 2085E, assuming a

i 3% discount rate. Data source: Dept. of Treasury, Dept. of Health & Human Services Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

USA Inc.’s Financial Disconnect

The country faces a fundamental disconnect between the
services the people expect the government to provide,
particularly in the form of benefits for older Americans, and
the tax revenues that people are willing to send to the
government to finance those services. That fundamental
disconnect will have to be addressed in some way if the
budget is to be placed on a sustainable course.
