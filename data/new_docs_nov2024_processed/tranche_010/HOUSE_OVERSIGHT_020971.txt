Financial Problems Do Not Seem Drastic

In fact, when Social Security was nearing bankruptcy in 1983, a
combination of moderate reforms led to 25 consecutive years of
operating surpluses.

Highlights of 1983 Social Security Reform
1) Raised full retirement age to 67 by 2027 (from 65)*
2) Reduced annual benefits by 5% (via a 6-month delay in cost-of-living

adjustment in 1983 & subsequent changes in benefit formulas and tax
schemes) .

3) Raised Social Security tax rates by 2.3% (via an advancement in
scheduled tax increase).

4) Made Social Security benefits (up to 50%) taxable income.

Note: *For people born in 1937 or earlier, full retirement age (with 100% Social Security benefit) remained at 65. For people
born after 1960, full retirement age was raised to 67. For people born between 1937 and 1960, the full retirement age
progressively increases from 65 to 67. Source: Social Security Administration archive.
