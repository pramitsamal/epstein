A. Yes.
Q. We will come back to your basis for that.
I want to go back to the police report.
We've clarified it never says Professor Dershowitz
abused anyone, correct?

A. It doesn't say that directly, but the police
report is part of a larger package of information that I
had available to me since you asked on December 30th
that suggested that Mr. Dershowitz was involved in the
abuse of minors.

I'm sorry. Let me correct that. In the
sexual abuse of minors, in particularly, minor girls.

Q. Would it be your position that anyone who was
a friend, or a friend of Mr. Epstein who visited his
house on more than a few occasions, that that's
sufficient to conclude that -- to allege that they

engaged in sexual abuse of minors?

A. No.

Q. Are we talking about guilt by association
here?

A. No. And that question requires a more

extended answer, which I would be happy to provide for
you, if you would like an extended answer.
Q. Let me ask you this question: You referred

to the police report, correct?
