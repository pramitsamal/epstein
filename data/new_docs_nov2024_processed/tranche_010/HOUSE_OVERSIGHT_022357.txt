A sale to an IDGT results in greater value for heirs than if the asset were held
outright

1. Assets do not receive a step up in basis upon death

* Value shown is prior to assumed valuation discount of 30%, the value of assets for gift tax purposes is assumed to be $45,000,000

** Value shown is prior to assumed valuation discount of 30%, the value of assets for gift tax purposes is assumed to be $373,701,591

*** In scenario 1 an estate tax exemption of $1,000,000 is applied. This is the lesser of the $5,000,000 gift tax exemption applied to scenario 2 and the $1,000,000
applicable estate tax exemption in year 20

Assumptions: The arithmetic return of asset years 1-20=15%;of which ordinary income/short term capital gains = 15%;interest rate paid to grantor = 2.89%;

annual interest payment=$1,300,500; valuation discount = 30%; transfer tax rate (for transfers at the end of year 20) = 55%.

On June 7, 2001, President Bush signed into law the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) which significantly changed estate, gift, and
generation-skipping transfer taxes. On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Jobs

Creation Act of 2010, which institutes estate, gift, and GST taxes at 35% with a $5MM exemption for 2011 and 2012 (adjusted for inflation), after which rates and exemptions
will return to pre-EGTRRA levels.

NOTE: Analysis assumes that at the end of year 5 the $41,522,399 cumulative remainder of cascading GRATs from page 5 is used as
seed capital for another note at 9:1 leverage used to purchase $373,701,591 of assets at a 30% discount using today’s long-term AFR
of 2.89%
