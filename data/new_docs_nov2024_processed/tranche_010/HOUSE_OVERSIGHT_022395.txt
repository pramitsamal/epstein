Trade

Trade legislative issues could figure prominently in 2017.
During the campaign, President-elect Trump argued
vigorously against the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP), vowed to renegotiate the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and pledged to label China as
a currency manipulator, which could trigger the
imposition of significant tariffs on Chinese imports.

Senate Finance Committee. President-elect Trump may
find himself somewhat at odds on his trade agenda with
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch who has
supported numeroustrade agreements during his
congressional tenure.

House Ways and Means Committee. House Republican
trade leaders —including Speaker Ryan and Ways and
Means Chairman Brady —played a pivotal role in
advancing President Obama’s trade initiativesthrough
Congress, including passage of Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA) in 2015. A key question is how closely
they will work to support President-elect Trump’s trade
restrictionist agenda.

Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Unless TPP can
be approved in the 2016 lame-duck session (an extremely
unlikely prospect, as discussed above), TPP will not be
ratified.

Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
Agreement. US and EU trade negotiators failed to make
much meaningful progress on TTIPin 2016. Prospects for
TTIP are dim, given the President-elect’s trade priorities
and a potential chillin US-EU relations.

Other trade agreements? The Trade Promotion
Authority, enacted in 2015, provides enhanced fast-track
procedures for trade agreementsreached before July 1,
2018, with a possible extension to July 1, 2021. Will
President-elect Trump decide to launch additional trade
agreements that could be considered under the fast-track
authority in Congress? Following the U.K. vote on Brexit
this summer, some Members of Congress expressed an
interest in a possible US-U.K. free trade agreement.
