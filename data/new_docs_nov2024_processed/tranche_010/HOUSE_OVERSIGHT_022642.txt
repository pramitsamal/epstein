Tonistimmel, yes, the Secret Service guards the president. Today I question the sense of honor and/or discretion
of all politicians and government officials. This is no longer the America we were brought up in. And, Iam not
sure any of them have those qualities, or good intentions they once had.

Nursa/A1 Qaeda. In order to keep it all under wraps, Benghazi took care of all credible witnesses. IMHO.

Rocquedog, I agree he is a low life, and Hillary is just as bad. Her relationship with Huma Abedine and
