women, and Hillarys relationship with Huma is suspicious to say the least. Birds of a feather? Or should I say
perverts of feather?

99AIRFORCE, yes I do remember the white water land scandal, and you are correct about the outcome. If
anyone has any questions concerning this, the following site gives the information. They were criminals, and I
still do not understand how slick Willy was not considered so at the time of his nomination.

Bill Clinton has had a sexual problem for his entire life. People like the Clintons, Obamas, Bidens, Reids,
Schumers, Boehners, Bushs, etc. can willingly, knowingly, & intentionally commit crimes with no recourse.
The U.S. Supreme Court rules Obamacare is a tax, Most likely will make Hobby Lobby & similar companies do
what they are morally against, Will likely ultimately rule to enact strict gun control laws if not an outright ban,
Allow open boarders, & Immigrants. They always rule in the gov’ts favor. Rarely for the citizenship any longer.
If the Constitution is ever amended and/or rewrote which they are in favor of they need to be given term &
power limits. They are the Supreme Power of this Nation and have proven to be a bunch of decrepit buffoons.

BOBMANIO1, I sure hope so, this subject is outrageous, and I don’t know where the minds of these people are.
A pedophile ring is beyond my scope of understanding, and about one of the worst things that could ever be
considered acceptable. It is an extremely important issue, and I sure don’t want it to escape full coverage by the
media.
