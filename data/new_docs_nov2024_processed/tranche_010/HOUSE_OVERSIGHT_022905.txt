of Nowak’s research has to do with trying to “describe
cancer mathematically.” (Epstein preempts Nowak’s
explanation : “Think of cancer the same way as you
think of a terrorist group. The NSA has been able to
thwart a great number of terrorism acts by intercepting
communication signals from one terrorist to another.
That same dynamic, a form of signal intelligence, of
finding a terrorist in Europe, can be used to intercept
communication between cancer sells. Cancer cells
merely communicate in protean code rather than
electronic code. If you can decode what the signals are
saying you can jam those signal between terrorist
calls—essentially wipe out their cell phones. Likewise if
you can decode biological signals you can jam them too,
that’s the holy grail.’’)

Then Richard Axel, a Nobel prize winner in
physiology. Then Ron Baron who has $26 billion under
management in his Baron Fund. Then Josh Harris, the
co-founder of Apollo Global Management ($164 billion
under management) and owner of the New Jersey Devils
and the Philadelphia 76ers.

What goes on at Epstein’s house confirms
everyone’s worst fears about power and the powerful:
they are all in a secret and shared conversation. The
world runs on insider information. And, certainly, inside
Epstein’s dining room, it remains a man’s world—a rich
man’s world. Indeed his salons tend to offend most
every aspect of reconstructed gender and political
sensibilities.
