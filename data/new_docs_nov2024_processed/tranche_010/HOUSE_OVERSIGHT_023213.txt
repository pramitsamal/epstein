6. I assume we will move $$ to pay down loan the day or day after (?) apo-01 bank acct open. As you
know we cld do this as early as next monday/tuesday but then cash will be sitting in apo-1 while we're
waiting for apo-01 bank acct.

7. If there are sales of assets (or Ilc's) from leon to apol or apo-01 that needs to be buttoned down and
organized asap.

8. Same if you want another NEW trust in the mix as that will involve paperwork and opening an acct with
bank.

Let's discuss to make sure we're on the same page on process. B
