A Socratic Dialogue

Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up
every conceived notion, follow humbly wherever and whatever
abysses nature leads, or you will learn nothing.

—Thomas Huxley

Slave Boy: So it really doesn’t matter how you classify a teaching/
learning problem because there are many methods that could
apply, correct?

Socrates: And what follows from this?

Slave Boy: That it is not the classification that matters but the
methods entailed in that classification.

Socrates: And what do all these methods have in common?

Slave Boy: They all involve practice

Socrates: And what else?

Slave Boy: Real experience.

Socrates: And how is experience stored?

Slave Boy: Through cases.

Socrates: Expressed how?

Slave Boy: As stories

Socrates: So what follows from all this?

Slave Boy: That the methodology entailed in each classification of
learning types is not the real issue.

Socrates: And what is the real issue?

Slave Boy: Practice

Socrates: And?

Slave Boy: Dialogue

Socrates: Why dialogue?

Slave Boy: Because it is through dialogue that stories are solidified
and indexed

Socrates: So the classification of learning types doesn’t really matter
then, does it?
