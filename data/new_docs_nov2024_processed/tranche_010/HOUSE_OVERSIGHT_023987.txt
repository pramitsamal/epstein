In the mountainous north of the country, just over an hour from Porto,
the recently opened Vidago Palace has, in one fell swoop, raised the bar
for luxury getaways in Portugal. As far removed from the sun and sand
of the touristy Algarve as you can get, this is a destination for the
discerning traveler and the lover of fine things, whether they be cigars,
hand-painted silk wallpaper, the country's best spa or a championship
golf course.
