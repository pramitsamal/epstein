Key financial market driver 2 - US policy

Key questions

e Will the economic outlook deteriorate? Will QE3 become necessary?

e How will the election outcome change fiscal policy deliberations?

© Can politicians find an agreement to avoid sharp fiscal contraction in early 2013 (fiscal cliff)?

CIO View (Probability: 65%*) No QE3, political gridlock and some fiscal tightening
¢ The economy stays on a moderate growth path, coupled with stable core PCE inflation close to the Fed’s
target of 2%. UBS forecasts real GDP growth of 1.5% in 2Q 2012 (consensus: 2.1%) and 2.3% in 3Q 2012
(consensus: 2.4%), with some downside risk due to rising uncertainty. The Fed has decided to extend so
called Operation Twist until the end of the year. More near-term monetary easing is still possible, but it
is currently not our central scenario.

¢ In the elections, Republicans will likely lose seats in the House overall, but retain a majority; we also
expect them to win a narrow majority in the Senate. Obama will likely retain the White House. Such an
electoral outcome would confirm the existing gridlock between Republicans and Democrats.

e Against the backdrop of ongoing political gridlock, we expect only moderate fiscal tightening of about
0.9% of GDP in 2013. The government will likely let unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut expire,
but postpone income tax hikes and sequestration spending.

A Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*) No QE3, Democratic sweep and more fiscal tightening

¢ Propelled by ultra-expansive monetary policy and improved confidence, cyclical forces surmount the
structural hindrances and thus growth accelerates. More rapid growth leads to higher inflation, and the
Fed responds by tightening monetary policy sooner.

¢ The improved economic outlook raises the odds for an Obama re-election and makes it harder for
Republicans to win a majority in the Senate. US fiscal consolidation efforts are facilitated by faster rising
tax collections. A Democratic stronghold leads to some tax hikes and limited spending cuts. Fiscal policy
tightens by about 1.2% of GDP in 2013.
Negative scenario (Probability: 25%*)
¢ Structural hindrances dominate and weigh on the cyclical recovery, thus growth weakens or turns
negative. The Fed embarks on QE3, most likely in the form of agency MBS and Treasury purchases.

e Weaker economic conditions raise the odds for a larger Republican majority in Congress, but Obama
remains President. The debt limit is reached earlier and the Treasury runs out of money before year-end.
The political gridlock becomes dysfunctional, thus fiscal policy tightens by USD 600 billion (3.7% of UBS
estimate of 2013 GDP) in 2013 (“fiscal cliff”). The US credit rating is downgraded.
