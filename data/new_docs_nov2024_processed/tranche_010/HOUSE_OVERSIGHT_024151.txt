UK equities

FTSE 100 (27 June): 5,524 (last month: 5,266)
UBS View FTSE 100 (6-month target): 5,785

e We continue to like UK equities relative to global ones. An expected improvement in the global economy
over the coming quarters should support UK companies as 70% of revenues are generated abroad.

¢ Energy is the largest sector of the UK market. While the oil price eased sharply over the past months, we
expect it to stabilize in the second half of 2012. An attractive valuation of the energy sector at 6.5x trailing
earnings provides some buffer for earnings volatility going forward.

e Profitability of UK banks is reasonable. They are less affected by the sovereign debt crisis than their
Eurozone peers. While the recent easing of collateral requirements by the Bank of England is supportive in
the short-term, the profitability of the domestic operations could be negatively affected by the
implementation of the ring-fencing bank reform by 2015.

¢ UK equities’ P/E, at about 10.0x trailing, indicates attractive value relative to global equities. Based on our
12-month forward earnings growth estimate of about 5% and the P/E multiple slightly expanding to 10.3x,
we expect UK equities to show good returns over the next six months.

4 Positive scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 6,650

¢ Continued global growth and strong demand from emerging markets should support demand for
commodities, helping the Materials and Energy sectors to lead the market higher. The market could re-rate
to a P/E multiple of close to 12.0x, and we would expect earnings growth of 5-8% over 12 months.

& Negative scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 4,400

e A global recession drags UK earnings down by 15-20%. The market's defensive characteristics would only
partly offset its strong exposure to commodity-related sectors. We would expect the trailing P/E multiple to
drop towards slightly below 9x.

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e We like the Energy sector due to
attractive valuations; Consumer Staples
is another preferred sector Because of
its defensive qualities.

e Approaching the end of the patent cliff
should remove some uncertainty on the
Healthcare sector and enable a re-
rating.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e As commodity-related sectors, Energy
and Materials should benefit from
robust demand in emerging markets.

e The UK market's 4% dividend yield
provides a good income stream.
