Revenue. During the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, revenue increased $35.6 million, or 2.5%,
over the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to tuition rate increases, which took effect
in January 2005 and September 2005, offset by the impact of center closures and a slight decline in
Utilization. However, during the third quarter of 2005 Utilization levels increased versus the same period
in 2004, from 59.3% to 60.3%. This positive Utilization trend was repeated in the fourth quarter of 2005
as levels rose to 59.2% versus 58.9% in the comparable period of 2004. Management believes these
improvements reflect stronger economic conditions, strong back-to-school enrollments, marketing efforts
and other management initiatives and programs. ECE revenue increased $24.9 million, or 1.8%, in the
52 weeks ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period of 2004. On a same center basis
(centers opened for more than one year), revenue increased 4.4% from 2004 to 2005.
