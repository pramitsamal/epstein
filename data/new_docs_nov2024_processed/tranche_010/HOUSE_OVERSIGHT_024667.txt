CHAPTER III
Cannabis Industry Segmentation

The nascent cannabis industry is often viewed by investors and others as a single, homogeneous indus-
try, in much the same way the “technology” industry was viewed in the early 1990s. As the technology
industry became more important to the global economy and was better understood by the investment
community, however, investment banks and other industry analysts tracked an increasing number of
discrete yet related industry segments. In the cannabis industry we are seeing a similar trend, which we
expect to continue as the industry evolves.

To help investors better evaluate investment opportunities in the cannabis industry, we currently
define five primary segments: production, distribution, consumer products, business solutions and
digital media. We further divide each segment into multiple subsegments. Each segment has unique
opportunities and risks. For example, companies that possess, manufacture or distribute cannabis
(commonly known as “touching the plant”) face risks related to violating federal law—and state-law
compliance obligations—not generally faced by providers of business software or digital media con-
tent. Many businesses operate in multiple segments, and we expect industry leaders to emerge in each
segment. The five primary segments and their subsegments are illustrated in the following chart.
