Figure 18 Interest Broad Based from Edibles...

In 2018, the CBD market in the U.S. has been estimated to have generated revenues
ranging from ~S600 mm to as much as $2 bn. In our 2019 global cannabis outlook
report (here), we had believed the CBD purchases in the U.S. likely skewed to the lower-
end of that range. However, with new survey data from Cowen’s proprietary consumer
survey, we can see that among our ~2,500 respondents (18+) in January 2019 nearly 7%
reported using CBD as a supplement. Coupled with the diverse form factors reportedly
being used (including close to 20% for beverages, which was surprising to us), we are
now inclined to size the current market at closer to $2 bn.

Indeed, looking at Google search trends, we can see that interest looks to have climbed
steadily in 2016 and 2017, and accelerated meaningfully in 2018, which has continued
into 2019.

Encouragingly, interest has been rising consistently among different form factors,
ranging from supplements like CBD gummies, to topicals and oils. The rising interest and
popularity in this broad range of CBD offerings should support a diverse category and
multiple competitors that cater to a large base of consumers with different needs,
requiring various applications.
