Beverages

Over the next two years, we believe that the beverage category can grow to a $900 mm
revenue opportunity. Our conviction in this category is underscored by our proprietary
consumer survey, which shows that almost 20% of CBD users consume beverages,
which we view as an encouraging sign. For 2019, we are forecasting a notable
acceleration in growth, with revenues more than doubling to $600 mm. Assuming
growth moderates in 2020 (to 50%), we believe revenues will approach the $1 bn mark.

Below we provide a sub-segment build by category, where we believe CBD water will
represent the lion’s share of sales at 65%. Energy drinks have been focused on health
and wellness and we believe that CBD-infused energy drinks will represent a niche
segment in a category that continues to see more competition. We expect CBD beer to
have a place in the category, though should admittedly be smaller in scale, given less
interest from a lack of THC.
