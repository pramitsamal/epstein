COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS

February 25, 2019

The below figure reflects the notable competition seen within vape as more companies
continue to enter the space. In addition to CBD only-focused companies, we are starting
to see crossover from adult-use / medical focused companies including Green Thumb
Industries and Curaleaf Hemp. Indeed, GTI recently announced the acquisition of Beboe,
which will offer a CBD vape pen with a focus on gaining distribution in high-end retail
stores. Curaleaf will offer their pen through its e-commerce platform and dispensaries.

Notably, crossover does not pertain solely to cannabis companies, as Turning Point
Brands recently announced a minority stake in CASH, a privately held CBD extraction
and production company. With a rapidly growing vapor infrastructure in place already
(from Vapor Beast, Vapor Shark and Vapor Supply), TPB has a number of avenues and
distribution points, both B2B and B2C, to introduce CBD vapor products to complement
its portfolio. As such, we look for new CBD product introductions from TPB over the
next year, with vapor as a logical entry point and key focus area.
