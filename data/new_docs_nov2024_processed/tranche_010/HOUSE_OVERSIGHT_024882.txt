Analyzing Two Key Verticals for CBD Adoption

As part of our monthly survey of 2,500 US consumers, we ask Amazon.com purchasers
to indicate which categories (out of a list of 30) they purchased on Amazon in the past
30 days. Our data shows that Personal Care Products and Vitamins & Supplements were
more likely to be purchased (vs. the average across all categories) by both Prime and
Non-Prime members throughout 2018.

Taking a closer look at 4018, in each month (on average) 19% of all Amazon Prime
Purchasers bought at least one personal care product and 15% purchased a Vitamin or
Supplement, while the average purchase rate across all 30+ categories was only 12% of
Prime purchasers. We noted a similar trend among Non-Prime Purchasers in 4Q18, with
13% who bought Personal Care Products and 10% who bought Vitamin or Supplements,
compared to the average purchase rate across all categories of 8%.
