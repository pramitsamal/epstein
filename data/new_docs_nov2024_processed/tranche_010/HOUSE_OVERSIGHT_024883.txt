Amazon Has A Modest But Expanding Physical Footprint

For CBD companies, expansion through Amazon’s retail locations and more importantly
Whole Foods’ expanding retail footprint are also attractive avenues for reaching new
customers (assuming CBD companies can convince Amazon and Whole Foods to carry
their products). While we currently lack insight into when CBD products may become
available in Whole Foods stores, or what a regional or national rollout might look like,
below we analyze Amazon’s physical footprint to highlight the potential for distribution.

Amazon’s expanding physical footprint is made up of a small number of Go Stores,
Amazon Fresh Grocery Pickup in Seattle, Amazon Branded Book Stores and most
notably its Whole Foods Market business. Whole Foods is a health focused supermarket
chain based out of Austin TX that operates ~470 US locations and was purchased by
Amazon in Aug ’17. Since acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon has deeply integrated it with
the company’s Prime offering. In combination with Amazon’s Prime Now platform,
Whole Foods is now offering 2-hour delivery on thousands of in-store items in 63 cities,
which account for over 50% of the US population and over 2/3rds of US GDP. Whole
Foods also offers curbside pickup in over 20 markets.
