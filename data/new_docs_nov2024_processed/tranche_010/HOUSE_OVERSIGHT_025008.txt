Assuming there is a veto, what would you gain by upgrading your
status in the General Assembly?

The advantage is that you can be a full member of UNESCO, the
International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court,
and you may be able to hold Israel accountable.

So that's the plan if you fail in the Security Council?

We haven't decided yet beyond that. We would have to come back
and put the question to the leadership. There were nine ideas
presented about what to do if America vetoes. Was going to the
General Assembly discussed? Yes. Was throwing in the towel
discussed? Yes. Maybe we'll make a decision about that in the next
two weeks.

Throwing in the towel? You mean disbanding the Palestinian
Authority?

The Authority was born to transfer Palestinians from occupation to
independence. If Mr. [Benjamin] Netanyahu [the Israeli prime
minister] thinks he can make this Authority in name only while he is
the sole master and source of authority, he will sweat. If we get a
[U.S.] veto and Netanyahu continues to build the settlements, I would
suggest that Netanyahu study carefully the provisions of the Hague
Convention of 1907 and the Geneva Convention of 1949 which
specify the responsibilities of the occupying power.

If you fail in the Security Council and don't at least upgrade in

the General Assembly, won't you risk looking like a failure in the
eyes of Palestinians, particularly after all this buildup? Have you
