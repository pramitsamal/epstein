managed their expectations?

Palestinians know exactly what's happening. People don't have high
expectations.... But maybe the Palestinian leadership should tell the
people that after 20 years we don't have a partner and we cannot
continue to be an authority in name only. That we should throw in the
towel.

Many see that as a bluff. Wouldn't you be throwing away years of
progress, institutions, security forces and putting hundreds of
thousands of people out of work?

We haven't made a decision. I'm not asking for the disbanding of the
authority. But I'm asking: Is this the authority that will take us to
independence? It's a joke.... The status quo is the worst situation for
us, worse than any storm that might come. I'm not in a position to
bluff or make threats. It's about choices.

It sounds like you are hoping that Israel will cry uncle.

Eighteen years ago I would have accepted this argument. But now I'm
a grandpa. I used to tell my wife that I never wanted my children to
go through what I went through, but then they did. And I didn't want
my grandchildren to go through it, and they are.

How does any of this get Israelis and Palestinians closer to an
agreement or get Palestinians closer to statehood?

At least I won't be looking in the mirror and telling myself that I'm
fooling my people.
