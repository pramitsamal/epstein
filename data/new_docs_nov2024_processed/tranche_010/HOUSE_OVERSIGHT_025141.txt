Many thanks. By all means let's concentrate on me and not Trump. If Enhanced Learning can make its annual
gift of 30 that would have a huge positive effect on me and my future. Let the market take care of itself. All
best

finally landed

very unpleasant journey

you had nothing to do with how Chapman acted and i apologise for suggesting it might be otherwise
it was entirely against me, partly motivated by a spiteful ex-friend

consulted two lawyers that Gordon recommended but they were very discouraging

the basic problem is simple—i am going against a strong national trend—well-known man after well-known man is being brought low for alleged
his misbehaviour toward women—in some case well-deserved prison time (Cosby and perhaps Weinstein) in many other cases, simply being run
out of institutions—exactly my fate

furthermore in he say/she say confrontations the evidence has shifted—in University settings at least—from 'beyond a reasonable doubt' to a
‘preponderance of evidence' to 'more positive than negative'

the loss is huge, on the order of a half million to a million dollars, meant to keep me alive (they were going to offer a five-year contract) while i let
my ‘inheritance’ be spent on children and grandchildren while also growing

i have no choice but to work

i will get my revised Wild Life to an agent later this week—have added 5 new chapters and a few sections—much stronger for the inclusion of my
major scientific work—1. social theory based on natural selection and 2. selfish genetic elements selected within organisms

then i have Honour Killings set to roll, as well as another one

hope you are thriving—and also hope Trump will stop this international trade nonsense—a lose/lose war—especially as it affects the stock market
or so it seems to me

best wishes
