* early-stage life science-based ventures, especially those with one or more of these technologies:
optics, wearable-sensors, brain-computer interface, behavioral engineering that goes beyond robo-
noodging. I am not up to speed on synthetic bio and CRISPR, but I have a good friend who is.

* cybersecurity for you and your life. I have carefully monitored the web for articles about you and I
have reason to think that those will persist indefinitely. I would be remiss as your friend if I did not
encourage you to be as diligent and smart as possible in using tools like Signal, two-factor/multi-factor
authentication, taking webmail archives off the web onto your own secure privately maintained archive
or deleted (unlike Podesta), and other measures.

* publicity for your cool-ass creative and important philanthropy in support of really good and
adventuresome, high-risk basic science research. Most obvious benefit: it would be nice to know you
hung out with the bright
