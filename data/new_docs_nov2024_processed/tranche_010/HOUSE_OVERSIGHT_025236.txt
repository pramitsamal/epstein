So where does that leave the US payroll and growth picture?

The weakness in the payroll report was almost entirely concentrated in retailing. Net of distortions and seasonal
adjustments, it looks like payroll growth is running at 150-175k per month, and GDP growth is running at a 2.25% trend
pace, both below prior recoveries. While 2.25% is a barn-burner compared to Europe, it only corresponds to a modest
improvement in employment. That’s why 2013 US fiscal policy is so important: this is not a recovery that can
withstand much tighter fiscal conditions.

So, how tight is US fiscal policy supposed to get next year?

Very, if you look at what is supposed to happen according to current law. In the chart, we show the annual change in the
budget deficit over the last 25 years. The impact of all provisions scheduled to expire and kick in during 2013 would be
very large. But if Congress and the President elect to extend current tax rates, retain lower payroll tax rates and extended
jobless benefits, etc, the adjustment would not be as big, and only reflect expiration of Recovery Act provisions, the
recently passed Budget Control Act, and some other smaller provisions. There are of course plenty of permutations in
between.

What direction is the Congress heading, and what did Larry Summers and Brad DeLong have to say about this recently?
Political outcomes this fall will affect what Congress does, but I get the sense that they will punt fiscal adjustments into
the future if they can, and impose austerity of no more than 1% of GDP in 2013. Ifso, Congress can point to a March
2012 paper by Summers and DeLong as justification. The bottom line from the paper: don’t tighten fiscal policy when
interest rates are near zero. The authors assert that (a) additional government spending can ease the long-term budget
constraint in conditions similar to today’s, and (b) tightening policy now would risk permanent loss of human capital,
lower labor productivity growth and lower trend growth. They have held these views for a while; the paper appears
designed to convince others.

Advocates for more fiscal and monetary stimulus often point to the charts below. Rising Federal debt has not resulted in
higher interest rates, so why not keep borrowing more? As for the Fed, balance sheet expansion prevented deflation and
