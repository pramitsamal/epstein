(12) The globalization of the world economy may have affected the distribution of wage rates at home. The U.S. has
seen international trade and immigration increase in the past few decades, as well as an increase in the consumption of
imported goods. Theoretically, an increase in imported goods, at the expense of domestic goods produced by
lower-skilled workers, could hold down wages of domestic workers, though research on the subject has been
inconclusive. An increase in the supply of foreign-born workers could also put pressure on wages in those jobs. But,
here as well, the effects of foreign workers on wage rates have been modest. Indeed, research note that immigrant
workers largely complement, rather than substitute, native-born workers, and thus have little impact on wages, while

actually increasing overall growth.

(20) For example, the Bush Administration tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 reduced the income tax rate, capital gains tax
rate, and dividend tax rate. Earlier, the tax cuts under President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s lowered the top individual

income tax rate to 28% from 50%. There was no reduction to the payroll tax rate until the Payroll Tax Holiday of 2010.
