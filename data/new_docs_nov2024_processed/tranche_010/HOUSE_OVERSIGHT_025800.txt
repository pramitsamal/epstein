Zalikow: US posture in Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. We can put non-uniformed
people in Iraqi Kurdistan. Kurdish conflict with NAM is about oil. These are big
bets. NAM is saying you oil companies can go to Kurdistan or Basra but not both.
Immediate neighbors of Kurds are Sunnis who also dislike NAM. What would US
position be if Iraqi forces fought with Kurds?

Madeleine: Turkey needs to be a key relationship. Need to assure that Turkey is a
solid partner in our efforts in region.

Feinstein: You guys underestimate activities and missions being executed by Qud
Forces and Republican Guards. Proxies are going to become major players.

Dov: If Syria goes Sunni, that’s bad for NAM.

Podesta: What role of AQI in Syria?

Kahl: Risk to Iraq is growth of NAMs power, but we couldn’t affect politics in Iraq
w 150k toorps what makes anyone think we could do it with 10 k troops. Also, we
couldn’t get SOFA cause all attys were saying we needed Parliament to approve
SOFA and NAM said he couldn’t take it to Parliament.

JS: Resid forces might have been helpful under some circumstances. Now, we
need to make clear that we do not support an Indep. Kurdistand. How do we do
that and still support Kurds?
