Argentina: Elections in October bring little clarity to
future

- The August 9 mandatory open primaries (PASO) brought little clarity as to who will
succeed President Cristina Kirchner in the October 25 elections. She has held office
since 2007 and, before that, her husband held the presidency from 2003-06.

- Kirchner’s handpicked successor, current governor of Buenos Aires province, Daniel
Scioli (of the Peronist faction) leads in the elections held last week. But the 2? and 3'¢
place finishers could band together to pull off a victory.

- The Argentine economy has seen zero growth this year. FDI has declined 41 percent
and inflation stands at 30 percent. Voters remain deeply divided over which candidate
and which economic policy to support. We expect continued problems for the
foreseeable future.
