Boris:

Here is the information sheet for Jeffrey to buy tickets. Tell him to use my name and the name of Magdalena
Schuster on the email below. They’ve already approved him to buy tickets to Lifeball and the Gala dinner
which happens right before the ball. I hope you guys are all planning to attend the dinner as well. You can tell
your friend Jeffrey that he should buy the Mini car for me as a thank you. =)

I’m getting in to Vienna on Friday afternoon. Let’s get together on Friday night.
See you soon,

Kevin

Hi Kevin,

attached please find an information sheet about the AIDS Solidarity Gala — I am sure Jeffrey will very much
enjoy the Gala.

I’ve also included the auction items at the Gala for your and Jeffrey’s information.

Let me know how I can be of further assistance.
