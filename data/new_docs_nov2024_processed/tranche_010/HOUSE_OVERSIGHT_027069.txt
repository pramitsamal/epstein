Matthews then raised $44 million from EB-5 investors, according to a complaint by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. EB-5 is a federal program that allows foreign investors the chance to gain a green

card if they invest at least $500,000 into certain projects that create at least 10 jobs.

The SEC’s complaint said, however, that much of this money was misallocated to pay for Matthews’
personal expenses. Some of the funds allegedly went to pay for Mathews’ Connecticut home, his 151-

foot mega yacht, as well as to save his Palm Beach mansion from foreclosure, according to the complaint.

In a separate lawsuit filed by a group of EB-5 investors, the development group claimed that famous
celebrities and politicians such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Celine Dion and Bill Koch — would serve

on the Palm House’s advisory board when, in fact, they did not.

Related Companies, led by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, developed CityPlace West Palm Beach.
The company is also proposing to build a 25-story office project called One Flagler in downtown West
Palm Beach.
