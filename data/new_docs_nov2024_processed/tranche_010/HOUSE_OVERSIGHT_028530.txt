overwhelming choice was Mr Obama, with 26 per cent, and Mr Gates behind on 12.

YouGov polled in Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, the US, Australia, Pakistan, Indonesia, India, China, Egypt, Nigeria
and Brazil, representing over half of the world’s population and the most populated country on each continent, and spoke to
total of 13,895 people around the world. We used a mix of internet and mobile phone surveys. In most countries we achieved
representative samples but in some we were unable to achieve good representation of rural communities. Our survey asked
two open-ended questions, seeking write-in answers: who do you think is the most famous person in the world, and who do
you personally most admire?

Although we specified that only living people should be considered, many wanted to choose Nelson Mandela anyway, and had
we conducted the survey a month earlier he would have come top. In China there was significant support for Mao Zedong,
Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, with 14 per cent between them, and had those respondents considered only the living, Xi
Jinping would have scored even more highly.
