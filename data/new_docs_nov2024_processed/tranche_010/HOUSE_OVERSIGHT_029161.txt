MY, MY—SO NOW WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF TELLING THE WORLD HOW GOD
WOULD HAVE HANDLED THE WHOLE MATTER. I BARELY UNDERSTAND MY
LITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD MUCH LESS THE MIND OF THE OMNISCIENT
CREATOR. WHO SAYS SHE OR HE IS BIASED TOWARD HUMANS? PERHAPS SHE
HAS AN AFFECTION FOR PLASMODIUM, AS IN HALDANE’S FAMOUS JOKETO WHEN
ASKED BY A CLERIC WHAT A LIFETIME STUDY OF EVOLUTION HAD TAUGHT
HALDANE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE CREATOR—“AN INORDINATE FONDNESS
FOR BEETLES’”—AT THAT TIME, 1/3®” OF ALL ANIMAL SPECIES—300,000—WERE
BEETLES.

| enjoyed Brian Mannix’s comment, most especially “Pseven”. His argument for
cooperation is the same as that of Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations. Once a
medium of exchange is introduced into a system of barter, itself a reciprocal
relationship, it can be vastly extended, with specialization such that one individual
no longer produces ten pencils/day, but ten people are specialized to produce a
single pencil—and thus a thousand/day. | too share an aversion to cultural/group
selection though perhaps for other reasons. But I side with Peter in feeling that
male self-domestication is more important in damping male psychopathy than
female choice—Richard Wrangham vs Sarah Hrdy among evolutionary
anthropologists.

Peter’s argument on reduction of inter-birth interval in humans again veers off into
culture-land when one does not need it—paternal investment, grandmother
investment and older sibling investment are all expected on genetic grounds. The
authority on the subject is David Haig at Harvard.
