e And the way to do it 1s this: a
strong, self-confident Israel, willing to
hold serious negotiations with the
Palestinians and the group of Arab
nations within an international
conference, backed by the US and the
Quartet — in order to achieve a two-
state solution and establish a regional
agreement, while maintaining an
unyielding and persistent fight against
terrorism and ensuring the IDF's
qualitative military edge over any
combination of opponents.

¢ The moderates among Arab
rulers are unable (and also unwilling)
to float this common interest and turn
it into policy — because they worry
how their people would respond. This
is how the Palestinian issue 1s related
to possibility of an overall agreement
in the Middle East.
