e And this isn't yust an
assessment.

¢ We must remember, vis-a-vis
the Palestinians, Israel can (practically
only) give. Regarding the rest of the
moderate Arab world — Israel can also
get, and a lot..
Not just recognition and legitimacy but
also an opportunity for regional
infrastructure projects — and mostly —
for the beginning of a process,
protracted though it may be — to
change the region's fundamental
attitudes towards Israel.

¢ On the road to seize this
opportunity — Israel will have to
consider embracing the Saudi proposal,
with Israel's reservations, as a basis to
negotiate a regional agreement.
