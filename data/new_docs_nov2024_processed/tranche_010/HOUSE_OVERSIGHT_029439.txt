OBSERVATIONS — INDIVIDUAL TAXES

Under the Act, there will be winners and losers on the personal income tax side. Generally, wage earners from
no-tax states... could see tax savings under the Act. For instance, a Florida taxpayer earning $1 million with
moderate itemized deductions may see a tax savings of about $30,000 under the Act. A similar taxpayer in New
York State may see a savings of about $3,500 according to our preliminary analysis..©

Conversely, very high-wage earners from high-tax states could see a higher tax bill. A taxpayer earning $3 million
in New York City may see a significant tax increase: $44,000 under the Act, due in part to the loss of significant
deductions. A similar taxpayer in Florida would see a tax savings of about $91,000 under the Act (primarily due
to the lower top rate, elongated 35% tax bracket and regaining itemized deductions that are no longer phased-
out), according to our preliminary analysis.

Married couples could fare worse than two single taxpayers with a similar amount of income. The so-called
marriage penalty hits particularly hard under the new tax brackets. The penalty is also exacerbated by permitting
married couples only a $10,000 state income/real estate tax deduction, but allowing each of two single filers a
deduction in the same amount ($20,000 combined). Under the changes, a single taxpayer with $500,000 of wages
