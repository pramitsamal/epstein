I’m really mad at the deception.
Should I just wait for her to call?

This guy different. Maybe married or old or something. I sense from body language she is really attracted but
he is unsuitable as partner.

I can hardly be possessive under circumstances but schedule changing because she gets a better offer is not
acceptable.

If I say this she will rage back about times I changed plans because of family and work constraints.

She knew I was upset. I think significant chance she Il send note saying this may not be fair to you why
Not take time off or that she will say this.

In her way very tough.
But nothing for now.
