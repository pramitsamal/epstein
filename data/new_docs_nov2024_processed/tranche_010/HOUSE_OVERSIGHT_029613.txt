We talked on phone. Then “I can’t talk later”. Dint think I can talk tomorrow”.
I said what are you up to. She said “I’m busy”. I said awfully coy u are.

And then I said. Did u really rearrange the weekend we were going to be together because guy number 3
was coming”

She said no his schedule changed after we changed our plans.

I said ok I got to go call me when u feel like it. Tone was not of good feeling.

I dint want to be in a gift giving competition while being the friend without benefits.
Think time to just stay away for a while. If there is potential here she II find way back.

I think I’m too eager weak at this point. The Prada thing by someone else is natural. By me seems
desperate.

Had good sense not to send off a note.

She must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so
holds to it.

I think life as stand by in case she needs leverage against another guy sucks.

But I get when I think about it stay cool.

guy 3 seems to be in London for weekend which is why my visit cut short.

I got mad. Didn’t send angry note after call though.

This is a ridiculous activity.
