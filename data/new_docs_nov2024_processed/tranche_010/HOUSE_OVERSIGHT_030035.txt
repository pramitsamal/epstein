groups on the other. But Syria's internal troubles might just as easily
have a negative effect.

Undoubtedly, the failed peace process has bred extreme frustration
among Palestinian militants, some of whom may think that a sharp
shock is needed to wrench international attention away from the Arab
democratic wave and back to the Palestine problem. They are anxious
to alert the United States and Europe to the danger of allowing the
peace process to sink into a prolonged coma. Israeli hard-liners, too,
may calculate that a short war could serve their purpose: Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government may sense
weakness and quietly dream of finishing off Hamas once and for all.
Syria has been a strong supporter of Hamas and has given a base in
Damascus to the head of its political bureau, Khaled Mashal. Turmoil
in Damascus could deal Hamas a severe blow.

On all these fronts -- Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel --
Syria is a key player. But its internal problems now threaten to
reshuffle the cards, adding to the general sense of insecurity and
latent violence in the region. And of all the threats facing the Middle
East, perhaps the greatest -- greater even than of another Arab-Israeli
clash -- is that of rampant sectarianism, poisoning relationships
between and within states, and breeding hate, intolerance, and
mistrust.

Several of the modern states of the Middle East -- and Syria is no
exception -- were built on a mosaic of ancient religions, sects, and
ethnic groups held uneasily and sometimes uncomfortably together
by central government. But governments have themselves been far
from neutral, favoring one community over another in cynical power
plays. Many Sunni Muslims in Syria and throughout the region feel
that Assad's Syria has unduly favored the Alawites, a sect of Shiite
Islam, who constitute some 12 percent of the population but control a
vastly greater percentage of the country's wealth. Open conflict
