unknown because decisions taken now would affect Syria for decades
to come.

The speech will disappoint all those who had hoped for immediate
and dramatic reforms. The President served up a diet of words rather
than of actions. He did mention, however, that elections would take
place in August, and that among the bills to be discussed would be a
new electoral law, a law allowing for the formation of political
parties, a media law, a law to give greater powers to municipal

personal profit-and-loss account. He knows that he need fear no
foreign military intervention: After Libya, no Western power would
even contemplate it. Some soldiers have defected to the rebels, but
there has been no major split in the army or the security services, or

perhaps concerned for its naval base at Tartus. The Russian view is
that the Syrian crisis poses no threat to international peace and
