the United States could attempt to convince non-Hamas elements in
the PA to use and disseminate U.S. funds without any knowledge or
participation of Hamas. Yet such a plan may not withstand legal
scrutiny. If non-Hamas PA officials failed to honor the agreement and
Hamas gained access to U.S. funds, prosecutors might one day argue
that the persons who made the donation knew that such a result was
likely and disregarded the risk. Such “willful blindness” could serve
as the basis of a criminal prosecution. Or, the whole government may
turn out to be Hamas-affiliated, rendering any such distinction
meaningless.

The Obama administration could also instruct OFAC to grant specific
exemptions so that the United States could fund particular entities
within the PA. OFAC followed this strategy in 2006, announcing at
the time that “consistent with current foreign policy” it was
“authorizing U.S. persons to engage in certain transactions in which
the PA may have an interest.” Mirroring some of the exceptions listed
under PATA, OFAC exempted transactions with the Palestinian
judiciary, non-Hamas members of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, and various entities controlled by Abbas.

Although the United States sought to continue supporting non-Hamas
elements of the PA in 2006, it is doubtful that OFAC could repeat the
same tactic now, thanks to the relationship between Fatah and
Hamas. In 2006, Hamas campaigned against Fatah and tensions
between the two camps remained strong after the election. Armed
conflict broke out the following year despite the creation of a de facto
unity government, splintering the PA. Should the current
reconciliation agreement come to fruition, however, it would create a
joint power-sharing government. As a result, it may be more difficult
for OFAC to justify special exemptions on the grounds that certain
entities within the PA are insulated from Hamas; by all appearances,
they will be intertwined.
