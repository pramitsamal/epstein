The Last Word: Yikes!

When George Bush was elected president of the United States in
2000, it was due to the electoral college, even though his opponent, Al
Gore, won the national popular vote.

Hillary Clinton was elected senator that year, and she announced
that the first thing she would do was to get rid of the electoral college.

A few years later, as a columnist for the Mew York Press, | sent her a
letter asking about the status of that promise. She didn’ t reply.

On November 8, 2016, a crooked businessman, liar extraordinaire,
bragging pussy-grabber, make-America-white-again, anti-choice, anti-
Semite, fake Christian, the rapist of a 13-year-old girl in 1994 at a
pedophile party (she canceled a press conference one week before the
election because of death threats if she filed a lawsuit), climate-change
hoaxer, twitter addict, homophobic, apprentice politician, fucking fascist,
and of course Vladimir Putin’ s “useful idiot,” namely Donald Trump,
who was elected as an insanely narcissistic dictator based on the electoral
college (a rigged system), whereas his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the
national popular vote by almost three million individuals galore, to no

avail.
