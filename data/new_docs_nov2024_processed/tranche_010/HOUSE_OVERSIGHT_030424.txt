The Nobel Prize-winning Trinidadian author V. S. Naipaul has spent half a
century examining the legacy of colonialism on the Third World, unravelling
the guilt of the rulers and the self-serving myths of the ruled. His latest book,

The Masque of Africa: Glimpses of African Belief, is a travelogue in which

the author sets out to discover how far the old Africa's belief in magic has
been subverted by the outside world. Tickets are still available to see a giant
of Western letters.
