pleased to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year’s special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year
ranging from Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Blige, this

year’s ceremony looks to be the most star studded ever.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
