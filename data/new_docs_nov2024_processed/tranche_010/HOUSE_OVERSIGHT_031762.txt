Helga outlines the great potential for the world if a Russia,
China and U.S. partnership develops to fight terrorism and
develop the world economy. Trump’ s successful meetings with
China's president Xi Jinping and Russian President Putin is
promising. However, that relationship will only improve if the
American people step up to the challenge to ignore the British
media campaign attempting to subvert his presidency, and fight
to implement LaRouche's Four Law economic development
program.

Helga believes that only with the support of the
population will Trump be able to fulfill his campaign promises to
the American people to restore Glass-Steagall and rebuild the
country. The Glass-Steagall Act was signed by President Franklin
D. Roosevelt in 1933 as the Banking Act, which prohibited
commercial banks from participating in the investment banking
business. Helga makes an appeal from abroad to the American

people not to miss this great historic opportunity. Dictator
