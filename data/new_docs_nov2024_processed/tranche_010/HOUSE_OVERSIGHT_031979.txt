Over the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins and attempted negotiations, and
then, on December 2, the infamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students to be

There was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who—long after she had forgotten what some
professor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment—would
remember, with perhaps a twinge of frightened pride, learning from a fellow demonstrator that if
she planned to go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an act of practical feminine

foresight to remove the earrings from her pierced lobes in advance.
