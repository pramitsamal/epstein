“New and noteworthy is a term that gets tossed around a lot in the travel world, but we're taking it seriously to heart this week
at Jetsetter. The new is the Dream Downtown NYC, a hip, reinvented space at the crossroads of Chelsea and the
Meatpacking District (MePa, if you really must). The noteworthy is a little thing called skydiving at Mount Everest. Whether
it's lounging poolside in New York or jumping out of a plane in full view of the world's highest mountain, there's a lot going on
this week. Read on for all the details, including properties in Paris, San Francisco, Vegas, Miami and more. (Image: Skydive
