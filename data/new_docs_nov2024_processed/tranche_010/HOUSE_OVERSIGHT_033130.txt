estates and gigts are taxed on the value of what was transferred not the underlying thing. ex if you own
10 percent of a partnership interest in a 1 million builidng that cannot be sold for 20 years. what is the
value of your interest. not 10 percent of 1 million as you only own a Itd partnership right. maybe 2
percent. its all legal
