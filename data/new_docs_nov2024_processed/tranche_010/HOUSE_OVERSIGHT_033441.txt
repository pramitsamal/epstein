this is only the first quarter of the game. if you call atime out, its on the field and done with dignity, you
cant retreat into the locker room and send a note to the opposing side. _in the next quarter she will appreciate
whatever you've said with respect and founded on strength. you care very much for this person. you might
want to demonstrate that. a note does the very opposite. . its like trump firing comey. :)

are essential to the plan. I think much of this is your uncertainty and not hers. sorry. and yours is
infectious

Ok. Best to make reversible errors
I’ve written note for exit strategy 1. Not going to send for few days.

Going to treat it all as a game till I maybe see her in Beijing and out of character ignore and look past her
bad behavior.

Best to stop obsessing.
