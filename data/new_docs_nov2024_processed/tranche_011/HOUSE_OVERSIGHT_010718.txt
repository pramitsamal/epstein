True Detective collectively earned him Best
Actor by December.

The actress who really stole the show
on the campaign circuit was eloquent
ingénue Lupita Nyongo, who morphed into
a fashion goddess. No one will forget her
Best Supporting Actress acceptance speech
when she said, “It doesn’t escape me for one
moment that so much joy in my life is thanks

to so much pain in someone else’s

I flew to L.A. with some indefinable eye
infection that made Olympics reporter Bob
Costas’ reaction to Botox look attractive. My
medical calamity possibly caused by Latisse,
which promotes eyelash growth, caused
my eyelids to resemble red golf balls and
necessitated the wearing of dark glasses.

No, I did not look as cool as Anna Wintour.

I managed to grope my way through Oscar
week in couture Ralph Rucci gowns and furs
and pretend temporary blindness was “just a
new look?

On this, my 30th trip to The Beverly Hills
Hotel, the famous Polo Lounge had finally
been renovated to look exactly like it did
30 years ago so as not to upset the regulars.
Each pool cabana now had giant flat screens
installed for watching CNN in the sun. Cate
Blanchett and Oprah Winfrey were the hot
Oscar week guests.

I headed over to the Vanity Fair Social Club,
with its media-friendly “WeWork Hollywood”
pop-up lounge. Vanity Fair publisher Ed
Menicheschi, who perfected the Midas touch
for masterminding Oscar week sponsorship,
greeted me. I participated in a panel discussion
of Oscar prognosticators about who would
win, hosted by Michael Hogan of VEcom with
Anne Thompson of IndieWire, Sasha Stone
of Awards Daily, Pete Hammond of Deadline,
Dave Karger of Fandango, Krista Smith of
Vanity Fair, and Kyle Buchanan of Vulture.
If you had put fire to our feet we could not
tell you who was winning Best Picture. Like a
bunch of nerds all trying to impress each other,
we did predict every other category correctly.

The town was crawling with stars. So it
wasnt shocking to find the most famous
sitting in the middle of a public restaurant
drinking and singing oldies by the Eagles
and Neil Diamond. That was the scene at
Nobu in L.A. where Bono and U2, here to
perform Mandela’s theme “Ordinary Love”
at the Oscars, sat drinking sake and George
Clooney's Casamigos Tequila with Clooney
himself, and Cindy Crawford and Rande
Gerber as they all belted out songs.

George left town soon after, was rumored

Jennifer
Lawrence

to stop in London to see his new girlfriend,
Oxford-educated British barrister Amal
Alamuddin, and they headed to an exotic,
secluded island for a much-deserved vacation.
After winning the Oscar last year for producing
Argo, George had a supporting role in Gravity;
co-produced August: Osage County; and
starred in Tomorrowland, which Disney will
release in 2015. He also produced, wrote,
directed, and acted in The Monuments Men.
Clooney marched to Berlin, Milan, London,
and Paris, successfully opening that film.
With his Oscar night absence, not only did
he make sure Sandra Bullock got all the credit
she deserved, but my hunch is that he was
also quietly proud of his good friend Brad
Pitt, who produced 12 Years a Slave, Gravity's
biggest competition.

honored world-class photographer Annie
Leibovitz for the launch of her new sumo-
sized book, Annie Leibovitz.

André Balazs confided that Annie pulled
an all-nighter in her pajamas hanging her
work. Balazs gave her free reign to install
her huge iconic portraits throughout the
hallways and first floor suites that were open
during the party.

Photographers Mario Testino and Terry
Richardson browsed as Annie walked
Quincy Jones on a tour of her larger-than-
life exhibition. Sylvester Stallone gazed at his
own portrait taken 20 years ago, his Dorian
Gray Rocky face now frozen—as in Botox—
not the blockbuster animated Disney winner.
