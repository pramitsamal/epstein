but, obviously, Epstein and his criminal associates have
had the ability to -- to destroy the evidence that's
been -- that we have been trying to gather.

Q. And in -- in your answer a couple of
questions --

A. 1I--I'msorry. I shouldn't say destroyed.
They have been able to conceal would probably be a more
accurate term, the -- the evidence that we are trying to
gather.

Q. In my answer -- in my answer --

A. Yeah.

Q.  -- in the question and answer, your answer to
my question a couple of questions ago, you talked about
whether Mr. Epstein and Virginia Roberts would have the
same or equal ability to disclose --

A. Right.

Q. -- what these prominent politicians,
et cetera, had done, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Without attempting to make any comparison,
you would agree, would you not, that as of December
30th, 2014, Miss Roberts had the ability to name the
names of the people who are referenced in this document?

A. Physical ability, yes.

Q. And -- well, let me ask this: You say a

well-known prime minister. Is that Prime Minister
Barak?

MS. McCAWLEY: I'm gonna instruct you not to
reveal any attorney/client communications you had
with Virginia Roberts on the specifics of her
counsel to you about these individuals.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Is one of the other -- one of the powerful
business executives, Les Wexner?

MS. McCAWLEY: Again, same instruction.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Okay. Now, you mentioned yesterday -- well,
a moment ago, you testified that these -- in your view,
these allegations about other powerful men furthered
Miss Roberts’ legal position in the case, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And it's also your position, I assume, that
the allegations regarding Professor Dershowitz and
Prince Andrew furthered Miss Roberts' legal position; is
that right?

A. Absolutely.

Q. Does the fact that Judge Marra struck those
allegations as impertinent, scandalous, and completely
irrelevant to the case, cause you to reassess?

MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. Is that -- is that

MR. SIMPSON: Back up.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. What is your understanding of Judge Marra's
ruling with respect to these allegations about Professor
Dershowitz and Prince Andrew?

A. That they were premature.

Q. That's your understanding of his order?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

A. And I-- maybe I should -- I see some
skepticism there, so let me explain why I think those
allegations --

Q. Yeah. Well, we can pull -~

A. -- are appropriate.

Q. ~~ we will pull out the order itself --

A. Sure.

Q. _-- at the appropriate time, but first, your
understanding is that the judge didn't find that those
allegations, at the time they were made, were so
irrelevant to the case, that they should be stricken
from the public record?

A. Inthat pleading at that time, remember, we
had in our -- our brief -- let me explain the -- the
nine reasons why we thought that those allegations were

ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400
299
relevant to the case, since I think your question calls
for that.

Q. Are those the nine reasons you gave
yesterday?

A. No, I didn't have a chance to.

Q. Are they the nine reasons that are set forth
in your -- in your brief?

A. They are. Those are the nine reasons that
are set forth in the brief.

Q. Okay. And -- and Judge Marra had that brief
in front of him when he held that, these allegations
were so not relevant to the issues before the court,
that they would be stricken and not part of the public
record?

A. At that time, in that particular pleading --

I think you're mischaracterizing Judge Marra's ruling in
its entirety, He specifically said that the allegations
could be reasserted, if they were relevant to issues
that are -- that were coming up. And so, in following
that ruling, we went to the U.S, Attorney's Office,
propounded discovery requests and said, look, we believe
you're sitting on information that Dershowitz was, you
know, connected with the -- with the criminal
trafficking here; we would like you to produce those
documents.
