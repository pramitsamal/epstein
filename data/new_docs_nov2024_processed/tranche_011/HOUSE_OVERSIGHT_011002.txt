That still leaves the mystery only half solved. How exogenous (sourced from
outside) are the genius and happenstance? Can we coax them along by policy? That
isn’t really my field. What seems reasonably clear is that growth flourishes in
secular free markets with solid infrastructure and rule of law. How to get those
things is the problem. I will suggest that the answers, whatever they are, will be

developed outside the usual marginalist perspective of supply and demand.

The Free Growth Equations

Now back to Mill’s argument. Notice first that he puts it all in the present tense.
Modern growth economists have preferred what I called the lagged flows method:
spikes in investment are compared to later ones in output. Mill here is substituting
what I called a concurrent rates method: he compares changes in consumption rate
to changes in capital growth rate at the same time. He writes that “whatever
increases the productive power of labor ... enables capital to be enlarged ...

concurrently with an increase of personal consumption.”

Let’s follow that. Mill’s root assumption is the Y =I +C equation in its net form

(4.1b). Put the ex post version as

output = growth + consumption, (4.2)
meaning net output, growth of physical capital and all consumption. The Y rule says
the same with the hidden asterisks after growth and consumption. So it will
continue for the rest of this discussion. (4.2) shows that less consumption implies
more growth, or less output, or some of both. Mill was asking which. To show how
to find out, first arrange (4.2) as

growth = output —- consumption, (4.2a)

again because terms can change sides if they change signs.
