Multimillionaire perv Jeffrey Epstein may not consider his Florida conviction for soliciting a
minor a big deal, but New York does.

A state appeals court yesterday upheld the financier’s status as a Level 3 sex offender —
meaning he’s considered “a threat to public safety” and a “high risk” to offend again.

Epstein, 58, did 13 months in a Florida jai! for soliciting a minor to perform a sex act on him
during a “massage.”

Although he was never indicted or convicted for hiring any other underage girls, the state
Appellate Division found there was “clear and convincing evidence” he had indeed done so,
making the Level 3 designation appropriate.
