deposition, leave. But you'l| be back here.

MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me. if | could just
make the record, instead of interrupting me,
please, that's what we do professionally. There's
a recorder here. I|'m certainly not being
obstructionist. I|'m going to make the record.

But we're going to act with some semblance of
professionalism, hopefully, by all parties in the
room. That goes to me, that goes to your
co-counsel sitting behind you and next to you, the
court reporter and everyone else in the room.
Everyone goes entitled to that.

You've asked a question. She answered the
question fully and she's not going to be harassed
because you don't like the answer. If you want to
follow up --

MR. TEIN: Stop engaging me. Make your

speech and then we'!l! ask the questions.

MR. LEOPOLD: Well, you won't let me finish
making the objection, so it's difficult to do
that. But if you want to follow with an
appropriate question, feel free to do that. But
we're not going to harass the witness.

MR. TEIN: 1 disagree with everything
you've said. Let's ask the questions. Okay?

MR. LEOPOLD: Ask an appropriate question.

MR. TEIN: Are you going to stop talking?

MR. LEOPOLD: I'm going to make -- protect
my client and make appropriate objection, but

there's not a question pending right now.
