Endnotes: Prologue. Evilution

Recommended books:

There are numerous books about evil, most written by philosophers, theologians, historians, political
scientists, and legal scholars. The following recommendations are for books about evil written by
scientists. They are terrific, I have learned a great deal from them, and some of their ideas powerfully

Notes:

* For a philosophical account of the nature of goodness that treats evil as a deviation from our species’
repertoire, see Philippa Foot Natural Goodness (2001, Oxford, Clarendon Press).

* For an explicit, philosophical argument for the connection between pleasure and evil, see Colin
McGinn‘s Ethics, Evil and Fiction (1997, Oxford, Oxford University Press). For a comprehensive
discussion of evil by a philosopher, including important critiques of the existing literature, see John
Kekes’ The Roots of Evil (2007, Ithaca, Cornell University Press)

chimpanzees and war in nomadic hunter-gatherers: evaluating the chimpanzee model. Human Nature;

* The most serious treatment of Stangl can be found in the penetrating interview by Gitta Sereny (1974,
Into that Darkness: From Mercy Killing to Mass Murder. London: Random House). There have been
different treatments of Adolf Eichmann, most famously by Hannah Arendt in her Hichmann in Jerusalem:
A report on the banality of evil. (1963, New York, Viking Press). Arendt’s perspective on Eichmann as
