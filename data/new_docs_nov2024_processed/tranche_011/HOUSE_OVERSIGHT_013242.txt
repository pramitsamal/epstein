A.2 Glossary of Specialized Terms

Abduction: A general form of inference that goes from data describing something to a
hypothesis that accounts for the data. Often in an OpenCog context, this refers to the PLN
abduction rule, a specific First-Order PLN rule (If A implies C, and B implies C, then
maybe A is B), which embodies a simple form of abductive inference. But OpenCog may
also carry out abduction, as a general process, in other ways.

Action Selection: The process via which the OpenCog system chooses which Schema to
enact, based on its current goals and context.

Active Schema Pool: The set of Schema currently in the midst of Schema Execution.
