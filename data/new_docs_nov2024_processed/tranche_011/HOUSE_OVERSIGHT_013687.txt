essential) can find easy-to-use algorithmic help in Cambridge University Press’s
Numerical Recipes series (Press et al, 1991).

The conceptual and communication gaps between applied mathematicians
and physicists and the bench practitioners of the neurosciences, that inevitably lead
one or the other, most often both, to surrender their deepest intuitions to jointly
shared images that are inevitably more simplistic, are no longer inevitable. With her
own hands on both the quantitative conjectural and experimental machinery, the
motivated practicing neuroscientist can honor her own insights, read about and
construct symbolic representations from her intuitions and do her own quantitative
theory. Computerized numerical techniques have become so powerful and
accessible that, even in academic settings, there is debate about whether
fundamental analytic tools, such as series expansions, should be taught in
undergraduate courses about differential equations.

The practice of “try it and see what happens, with the current name of
experimental, computational mathematics, is accessible to all. In addition to the
powerful general mathematical programs noted above, there exist several sets of
more specifically targeted software with the capacity to generate, portray and
quantify the behavior of nonlinear continuous and discrete abstract and real
dynamical systems. These often also include algorithmic modules that are useful in
tailoring new models and measures (see for examples, Parker and Chua, 1989;
Baker and Gollub, 1991; Nusse and Yorke, 1991; Sprott and Rowlands, 1991;
Sprott, 1993; Korsch and Jodl, 1994; Enns and McGuire, 1997). Learning from and
using this software, along with only a little programming in the high level languages
and computer algebra programs listed above, permit the non-mathematician
neuroscientist, willing to read in the literature such as that described below, to do
independent, cutting edge research in applied dynamical systems.

Described below will be the computational discoveries in abstract systems
and real neuroscientific data that have led to multiple contexts of quantitative
description. These include those that are: (1) Geometric and conserve metric
distances; (2) Topological and conserve relative positions but not distances; (3)

Single or multiple global quantitative descriptors such as scaling numbers or scaling
