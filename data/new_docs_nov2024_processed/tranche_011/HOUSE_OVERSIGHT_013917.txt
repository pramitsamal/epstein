Royalty-Free Photos and Materials

iStockphoto is the Internet’s original member-generated image and design site, which has more than 4
million photographs, vector illustrations, videos, audio tracks, and Flash files available for use.

» Getty Images ( www.gettyimages.com )
This is where the pros go. Stock photos and film of anything for a price. I pay $150—400 for most images
I use in national print campaigns and the quality is outstanding.

End-to-End Site Solutions with Payment Processing

=» Shopify ( www.shopify.com )

This is a reader favorite that, in addition to beautiful design, offers full SEO (search-engine
optimization), drag-and-drop use, statistics, and product fulfillment through one of their certified
partners such as Fulfillment by Amazon.com. Clients range from small-business owners to Tesla Motors.
Unlike with Yahoo and eBay, however, you will need to set up a payment-processing service to accept
payments from customers. (See below — PayPal is the easiest to integrate.)
