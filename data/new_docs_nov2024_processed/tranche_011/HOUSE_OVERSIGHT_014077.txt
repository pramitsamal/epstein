the criminal justice process.*!* Moreover, every state has adopted a statute
that either enforces its constitutional amendment or creates independent
statutory rights for crime victims.”'” As a result, state legislatures and state
employees have attempted to give victims a voice in the criminal justice
process across the country.

Notably, while the strength of these rights varies from state to state,
nearly forty states require the prosecuting attorney to notify or confer with
the victim regarding plea negotiations.**’ Several jurisdictions involve the
victim in the charging decision.” In some states, law enforcement and
prosecutors must involve the victim at any “critical’”?”? 14 stage

or “crucia
of the criminal proceeding; and in a minority of jurisdictions, the judge
must ascertain whether the prosecutor has afforded the victim statutory
protections prior to accepting a plea agreement.””°

The general contours of state provisions suggest that several state
governments have recognized the value in informing victims of their nghts
and involving them in the criminal process prior to the formal filing of
charges.”*° Indeed, a brief look at the statutory protections illustrates the
extent to which states have attempted to afford protections to victims long
before the formal filing of charges.

Fifteen Years After the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime, 25 NEw ENG. J. oN
CRIM. & CIV. CONFINEMENT 21, 64 & n.168 (1999) (citing to victims’ rights statutes in
Connecticut, Hlinois, and Michigan, among others). Unfortunately, as some commentators
have noted, the notice and conferral provisions in some states are ambiguous, and the
absence of case law precludes a definitive understanding of the reach of the night in some
Jurisdictions. See LAFAVEET AL., supra note 168, § 21.3(f), at 1041-42; see also, e.g., KAN.
Stat. ANN. § 74-7333(a)(5) (2002) (“The views and concerns of victims should be
ascertained and the appropriate assistance provided throughout the criminal process.”). In
some jurisdictions, the ambiguous use of an illustrative list could be read as suggesting that a
particular right, such as conferral, hinges on formal charges. See, e.g., Ky. REV. STaT. ANN.
§ 421.500(6) (LexisNexis Supp. 2012) (requiring consultation on “disposition of the case
including dismissal, release of defendant pending judicial proceedings, any conditions of
release, a negotiated plea, and entry into a pretrial diversion program,” but failing to define
“disposition” or “case”).
