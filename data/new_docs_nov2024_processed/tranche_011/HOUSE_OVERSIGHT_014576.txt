incentives to invest.

As a result, Eurozone policy is likely to remain
accommodative, keeping financial conditions
supportive of growth. While we expect the
European Central Bank (ECB) to gradually shift
to a more neutral stance that is less punitive to
bank profitability and acknowledges the uptrend
in headline inflation, this shift does not imply the
removal of accommodation. Indeed, the ECB has
already announced an extension of quantitative
easing through December 2017. Meanwhile, the
European Commission has endorsed a moderate
fiscal easing of 0.5% of GDP for the Eurozone.
Given that fiscal policy is typically loosened ahead
of major elections, this guidance could soon be
embraced in France and Germany.

Of equal importance, both consumption and
business investment are well positioned as we enter
2017. On the former, continued improvement in
the labor market and ongoing GDP growth should

encourage consumers to spend a bit from their
precautionary savings, particularly given today’s
relatively high savings rate. At the same time, the
fundamental justifications for increased business
spending, such as higher demand and easy credit
conditions, stand at their best levels in years (see
Exhibit 42). Perhaps not surprisingly, a late 2016
survey of manufacturing firms revealed their
investment intentions stood at all-time highs.!%

Of course, ongoing uncertainty regarding
Brexit, the banking sector and upcoming elections
remains a potential downside risk, particularly
for an investment recovery. As a result, we
acknowledge a greater-than-normal range of
potential outcomes, both positive and negative. For
example, the victory of the far right in the French
presidential election could unleash fears about
France exiting the European Union and endanger
the survival of the euro, while the new government
in Italy could speed up the long-overdue
resolution of the banking sector’s
problems and change the electoral law to
reduce political uncertainties.

For now, our base case assumes
that Italy will avoid a populist party in
government and that a centrist candidate
will win the French presidential election.
Thus, we expect the Eurozone to again
weather the storm in 2017.
