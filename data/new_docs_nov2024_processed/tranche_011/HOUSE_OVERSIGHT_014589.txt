likely to exceed those of cash and bonds. In turn,
we recommend that clients maintain their strategic
weight in US equities, although we acknowledge
that risks have risen at the same time that returns
appear likely to be lower going forward. While US
equities are not yet running on fumes, we should
keep a close eye on the fuel gauge.

EAFE Equities: Priced for Imperfection

There is no shortage of concerns surrounding the
various countries that comprise Europe, Australasia
and the Far East (EAFE) equity markets. The

list is both long and valid, including persistently
low economic growth, a slow pace of structural
reforms and incessant political uncertainty, as well
as incremental, reactive and inconsistent policy
responses. Ongoing questions about the health of
the banking system only compound these worries.

But these concerns are also not new and are
consequently well understood by the market.

In turn, the key question facing investors is not
whether EAFE exposure subjects them to downside
risks. As the preceding list demonstrates, it clearly
does. The question instead is whether investors are
being fairly compensated to bear these risks.

One can never know precisely what equity
markets are discounting, but the above concerns
are almost certainly a key driver of EAFE
underperformance and the main reason behind

today’s larger-than-normal valuation discount to
US equities (see Exhibit 61). While this margin

of safety does not guarantee outperformance,

it may provide investors with a larger buffer to
absorb adverse developments and miscalculations
in their forecasts. In our view, the risk/return
profile of EAFE equities is more attractive than it
first appears.

As a result, we do not recommend that
investors underweight EAFE equities. In fact, there
are reasons to believe that EAFE equities will
outperform US equities in local currency terms
this year. In the sections that follow, we explore
these reasons by examining the three main EAFE
markets, beginning with the Eurozone.

Eurozone Equities: The Onus Is
on Earnings

Earnings have been going nowhere fast for
Eurozone equities. That’s apparent in Exhibit

62, which shows that profits have been range-
bound—at nearly half their 2007 peak level—for
almost four years. As a result, rising valuation
multiples have accounted for all of the 25% price
appreciation over this period.

This seeming contradiction between stagnant
earnings and rising multiples reflects the copious
liquidity provided by the ECB’s quantitative
easing. By depressing interest rates, ECB policy
