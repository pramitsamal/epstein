3. Throughout the text, “past-
WWII cycles” refers to
expansions beginning in G2
1954. We exclude two prior
expansions, beginning in Q4
1945 and Q4 1949, to ensure
consistent data across all
variables used to analyze
the duration and strength
of recoveries (some data
series are only available since
1950) as well as to avoid
contaminating summary
statistics given idiosyncratic
economic policies that followed
the end of WWII (such as the
sharp reduction in military
spending or the Gl Bill). Gur
takeaway from the analysis
would not change if 1945
and 1949 were included for
the series for which data is
available.
