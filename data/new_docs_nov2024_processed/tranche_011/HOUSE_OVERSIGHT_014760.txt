Own FX vs rates vol: cheapen USD call with rates strangle

We like owning USD calls against selling US rates vol. In particular, we recommend
buying a EURUSD 3m 1.05 put for US$100 pips (off 1.0730 spot), partially
financed with the sale of US$100mn 150bp-wide 3m30y strangle (sold at
USS$600k).

While potential fiscal stimulus has already been priced into rates term premia and rates
volatility to some extent, it is not sufficiently priced into the FX market, in our view:

« Rates skew in gamma on long-tails has moved decisively for payers, while EURUSD
skew is just beginning to price in higher US rates (Chart 59}. This suggests to us
that the market may already be partially protected against higher rates in the long-
end, such that a further selloff may not see as strong a rally in gamma on long-tails.

e On the other hand, a further rally in the USD may catch investors under positioned
and result in greater volatility in the currency markets.

¢ Aprincipal component analysis of rates (US, EUR and JPY) and FX vols highlight that
US rates vols and USDJPY vol are expensive, while 3m10Oy vol in EUR and JPY are
cheap, along with EURUSD vol (Chart 60). While the cheapness of 3m10y vol in EUR
and JPY can be explained by expectations of QE expansion in the two regions, we
think that there is value in owning EURUSD vol.

From a terminal rates perspective, we are comfortable selling a 150bp-wide strangle for
the following reasons:

« We believe the result of the elections are a game-changer for the outlook on the US
economy. As such we have probably entered a new regime for US rates whereby we
are unlikely to retest the historical lows in 30y rates recorded in Aug-16 (1.67%).
This suggests little downside in selling an ATM-75bp receiver (1.66% strike).

« Inascenario where US rates sell-off, USD is also likely to strengthen. The positive
correlation between US yields and the USD has returned due to expectations for
fiscal stimulus boosting economic growth. Furthermore, we would also argue that a
substantial selloff in US rates, accompanied with USD strength may be self-
defeating as it would put pressure on emerging markets and risky assets, thereby
resulting in a flight to quality bid for USTs. The risk is that of large foreign reserve
selling by EM central banks, putting upward pressure on US rates and downward
pressure on the USD.
