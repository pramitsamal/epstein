ESTX50 put 3M 90-100 (%fwd) put skew has re-steepened to
near 5 year highs following the flattening which ensued after
the first round of the French presidential elections (23-Apr). The
recent ESTX50 skew dynamics are in stark contrast to what has
been witnessed in the SXEP (European Oil & Gas equity), where
the 3M 90-100 volatility spread has been trending lower and is
currently near-flattest in 5 years.
