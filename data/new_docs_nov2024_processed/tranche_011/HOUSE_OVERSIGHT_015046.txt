A Child’ s Primer on Telethons

See the tired man. He has been up all night. He is running a
telethon. He wants the people to send money. It is for leukemia.
That is a disease. Little children like you can catch it. Evil.

See the sexy girl. She is a singer. She doesn't know whether
the telethon is for leukemia or dystrophy or gonorrhea. Her agent
got her the booking. She needs the exposure. Notice her cleavage.

See the handsome man. He does know that it's for leukemia.
You can tell. He is singing a calypso melody. Listen to the lyrics.

“Give-your-money,” he sings, “to-leukemia. Give-your-money, to-
leukemia.” Listen to the audience applaud. He is very talented.

See the sincere politician. He is running for reelection in
November. He is against leukemia. He is willing to take an oath
against it. That proves he is against it.

See the wealthy businessman. He is making a donation. He
wants his company's name mentioned. Then we can buy his product.
Then he will make profits. Then he can make another donation next

year. Splendid.
