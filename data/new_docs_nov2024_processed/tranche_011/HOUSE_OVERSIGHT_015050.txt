don’ t have to. They have an ample supply of other people’ s evil
thoughts to draw upon.

This is the husband and his wife again. The ones who don’ t want to
have a baby yet. Now the calendar says that the time is sterile. How
convenient. Now they can make love without stopping. And without
worrying. But they’ re good, consistent Catholics. And so they are
worrying. Because they know that evil thoughts are evil. Their evil thought
is to have intercourse but to avoid having a baby. They can’ t be sure they
won’ t have a baby--that’ s why the rhythm system is moral--but the
intention is there. Tomorrow they will go to confession.

Postscript:

| wrote the above piece in 1958 (before the Pill), and it turned out to
be theologically correct in 1984, when Pope John Paul II warned that the
rhythm method of birth control can be “an abuse if the couple is seeking

in this way to avoid children for unworthy reasons.”
