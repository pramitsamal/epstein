in front of him, the first thing Johnson would do now is kill him.” She
smiled sardonically, adding, “Unless Bobby beat him to it.”
Postscript:

The most significant thing about “The Parts Left Out of the
Kennedy Book” was its widespread acceptance--if only for a moment--by
intelligent, literate people, from an ACLU official to a Peabody Award-
winning journalist to members of the intelligence community who knew
that sort of thing actually does go on. Daniel Ellsberg said, “Maybe it was
just because | wanted to believe it so badly.”

One caller claimed that he could determine, by feeding the article
into a computer, whether Manchester had written the portions | published.
Several individuals queried that final arbiter of truth, the Playboy Adviser.
One reader “went out and bought the original Death of a President just
to see if your parts would fit into the book--they did. Amazing!”

| also received a call from Ray Marcus, a critic of the Warren
Commission Report, who had discovered a chronological flaw in my article.
How could William Manchester leave something out of his book that was
itself a report of something that he’ d left out of his book? Marcus
deduced that 7he Realist must have been given the excerpts by a CIA

operative in order to discredit va/id dissent on the assassination.
