composing my farewell address—now this is utterly impossible to
describe—but | do believe it was some kind of extraterrestrial
communication.”

“In English or what?” | was dumbfounded.

“It was in English but also beyond all language. They told me that
their associates had been to see Harry Truman when /e was president.
Now remember Dick, he’ s the one who ordered the atomic bomb to be
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And yet these creatures convinced
him not to turn Korea into another nuclear holocaust. That’ s really why
he brought back General Douglas MacArthur.”

Ike stared ahead with a blank expression in his eyes.

“Sir, are you all right?”

“Yes. Yes. | just don’ t know if | can articulate this extraterrestrial
experience. It was as though my body remained in the chair and my spirit
was taken on a journey. All | know is that when | returned, | just had to tell
the truth. There was no other choice--

again. Nor did | feel it would be proper for me to broach the subject. |
