existence, and there was an overwhelming temptation to remain in that
blissful limbo. Yet there was also something in me that kept saying
“Don’ t give up! It was my survival instinct speaking.

But why not give up? What was there left for me? The answer came
to me by the same extraterrestrial path it had come to Ike: 7e// the truth!
That was the turning point of my life. And these memoirs are the tangible
result of my transformation. No one shall be spared, least of all myself.

Those hairless creatures told me that President John F. Kennedy had
also been visited by their kind. His father, old Joe Kennedy, had gotten rich
off illegal booze during Prohibition, and you can be certain that the
underworld bootleggers he was tied up with were not about to dissolve
their silent partnership in this huge liquor industry they had built up,
simply because Prohibition had been repealed. Yet there was Joe
Kennedy’ s own son, Jack—not to mention his brother Bobby—refusing
to cooperate any longer in allowing organized crime to have a comeback
in Cuba, and furthermore, going after organized crime in th/s country. At
best this was ingratitude; at worst it was treason.

But | finally understood the extraterrestrial force that had motivated
young Kennedy. And so now | am ready to peel away the final layers of my

poker-face mask.
