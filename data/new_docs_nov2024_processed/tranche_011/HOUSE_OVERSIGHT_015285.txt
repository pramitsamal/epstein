Prison Legal News is also preparing a lawsuit against the Utah
Department of Corrections for a policy that bars all books except those
that are shipped directly from Barnes & Noble. Generally, prisons require
that books be sent directly from the publisher or a major distributor, for
security reasons. Otherwise, a spokesperson for one jail explains,

“There’ s a possibility something could be in one of the pages that we
don’ t want. There could be little bits of drugs in the pages.”

“We have not yet sued them.” Wright told me, “since they only
sporadically censor us and aren’ t letting us develop a good fact
pattern.”

A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’ s Department
said that its jails allow inmates to receive books from booksellers after
checking to see whether they can be fashioned into a weapon, promote
violence or have sexually explicit content. Across the country, only
paperbacks are accepted. Hardcovers are rejected because they provide

“source material” for fashioning weapons. When the Supreme Court
ruled that law libraries did not have to be provided to prisoners, jails in
Montana not only removed the entire contents of the law library, but they

also removed the typewriters.
