The Last Election

The Republicans’ party line that Barack Obama was “palling
around with terrorists” didn’ t work, although some people believed it
because then they wouldn’ t need a racist reason not to vote for Obama.
Next, the campaign acted as though his advocacy of age-appropriate sex
education for kindergarteners meant putting condoms on cucumbers. That
didn’ t work, either. Then John McCain tried calling him a_ “socialist.”
Also didn’ t work. Ironically, Socialist Party candidate Norman Thomas ran
for president six times, and never won, but every one of his platform
planks were eventually adopted by Democrats and _ Republican
administrations alike. They just didn’ t ca//it socialism.

In January 2009, Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson stated that
God told him America is headed for veritable socialism as well as an
economic rebound under President-elect Obama. “What the Lord was
saying,” he claimed, “the people are willing to accept socialism to
alleviate their pain. Cast off all the gloom and the doom because things
are getting ready to turn around. | say with humility, | hope |’ ve heard the
Lord. | spend time praying and asking him for wisdom, and if there’ sa

mistake, it’ s not his fault, it’ s mine.” Humility in action.
