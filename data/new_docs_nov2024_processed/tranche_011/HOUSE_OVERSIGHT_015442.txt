“Oh--I figured you had the address wrong, so | took a walk around
the block.”
“Let's go to your apartment.”
“Don't you want to come up to my office?”
“| said. ‘Let's go to your apartment.’ ”
“You don't expect to find her there?’
“She leaves traces wherever she goes. By the way, do you have a
telephone at your apartment?”
“Oh, yeah, well, it happens to be the same number as my office,
incidentally.”
There was a certain tension between us while we were walking to my
apartment.
“Tell me, he said, “do you have many friends who smoke
Tareyton cigarettes?”
| suddenly realized what he meant by “She leaves traces.” At the
apartment, she was gone, but the bed was unmade and he couldn't help
but notice the semen stain on the sheet. Which, of course, was no proof
that it was she who had been there. However, the ashtray was filled with

Tareyton cigarette butts.

“Do you smoke Tareytons?”
