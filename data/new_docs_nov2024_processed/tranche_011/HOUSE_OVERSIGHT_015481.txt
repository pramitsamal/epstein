Iron: Your ancient blood

When you cut yourself, the wreckage of stars spills
out. Every atom of iron in your blood, which helps
your heart shuttle oxygen from your lungs to your
cells, once helped destroy a massive star. The fierce
nuclear fusion reactions that set stars ablaze create
the atomic elements of life. As the star ages, it fus-
es progressively larger elements, such as silicon, sul-
fur, and calcrum. Eventually, iron atoms are fused.
The problem is that iron fusion consumes as much

energy as it produces, so it weakens the star. If the

star is big enough, it will collapse in on itself, its outer
layers rebounding against the dense imner core, and a
supernova explosion will result. The blast sprays out

iron at supersonic speeds, fillmg great swathes of space
with debris that can form new solar systems. The iron
in your frying pan, house keys, and blood is essentially
cosmic shrapnel from the tremendous explosions that
ripped through our galaxy billions of years ago. The
same blasts also released carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
other elements of life, which later produced the sun,
the Earth, and eventually—you. ©
