am an inventor. I’ve always been an inventor. Ever since childhood

I’ve tinkered with electronics and computers, taking things apart

and putting them back together. There is no academic course
for inventing, so I had to choose my own path through school and
University. I studied design, physics and mathematics at secondary
school, and engineering and management at University. Part of that time
was spent in the Engineering Department of Cambridge University on a
particularly special course.
