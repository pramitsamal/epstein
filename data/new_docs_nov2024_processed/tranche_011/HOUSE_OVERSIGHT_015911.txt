The Machine

r uring probably learned of the Entscheidungsproblem in a lecture
given at Cambridge University by Max Newman. Newman
described a new proof by Gddel showing mathematics was

incomplete. The proof solved the completeness and consistency problems
by turning mathematical statements into numbers and showing you
could generate a logical paradox if you tried to argue for completeness
and consistency at the same time. Thus, of the three original Hilbert
problems, completeness, consistency and decidability, only decidability
remained unanswered.

Turing spent all of 1935 and much of 1936 thinking about
this question: Is mathematics intuitive, or could a machine decide
mathematical questions automatically? Eventually, cycling through
the Cambridge countryside one day, he stopped to rest in a field near
Grantchester and in a flash of inspiration envisioned his mathematical
machine. The machine was entirely imaginary but made as if from
mechanical parts common in the 1930s.

The idea was to reduce the process of computing with pen and paper
to its most basic level. Turing hit upon the idea of using a long ribbon of
paper tape similar to the ones used in telegraph machines. A paper tape
is simpler than rectangular paper as it can be handled mathematically as
a single sequence of numbers — we don't have to worry about turning the
page or working in two dimensions. If you are worried that a tape is less
powerful than a sheet of paper remember Cantor’s theorem: an infinite
plane is the same as an infinite line. The use of a tape massively simplified
the mathematics, and subsequently many early computers used tapes, as
they were easy to handle in practice as well as in theory.
