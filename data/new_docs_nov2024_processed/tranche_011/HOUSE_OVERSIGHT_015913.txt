Turing’s Machine 223

Old Fashioned Relay Mechanism

the button to go down. That logic did not exist in the relay banks. If you
wanted to improve the logic of the elevator you would need to rip out all
the relays and rewire everything from scratch.

Turing’s first imaginary machine was set up in the same way. It
had a fixed set of hard-wired logic, a rule book. In order to perform
different tasks — say addition or multiplication you had to use a different
rule book. His revolutionary idea was to write a rule book that told
the machine to read a soft-wired set of instructions from the tape and
execute those instead. He called this a Universal machine since it could
perform any procedure written on the tape. Today we call this software.
It is fair to say Turing was not the first to use this idea. Charles Babbage’s
analytical engine could read instructions from cards and execute
different procedures, but Turing thought through all the ramifications
of the idea and made it general purpose, giving us the modern science
of computing. It is easy to build a real Turing machine, but by today’s
standards it is a little clumsy; a team in Denmark has built one using
Lego. You can see a link on my website.

Very soon after Turing’s paper was published, a number of people
proposed better practical implementations. In 1943, John von Neumann
of Princeton University created the architecture for ENIAC, the first
stored program computer, developed for the United States Army’s Ballistic
