Creativity 311

and perspective. Once coded the program takes off and is remarkably
creative in its compositions, without any further human intervention.
However, each new capability must be hand-coded by its creator, Harold
Cohen. These paintings give a good visual interpretation for the sort of
latitude imposed by the logic limit. AARON can do some very impressive
things, but always in a mechanical — albeit beautiful — way, within the
rules set by Harold Cohen, the true artist. AARON will not suddenly
awake one morning and independently decide to experiment with the
color blue!

To give an idea of what I mean by ‘mechanical elaboration’ in a
musical context, imagine you were using a Casio synthesizer. These
machines have all sorts of fun settings. You can program them to play
drum tracks, fill in chords, and add a jazzy, syncopated harmonization
to your melody. But none of this is truly innovative. It’s mechanical
elaboration of your artistic material. Jape, AARON and Emily Howell
all do the same thing within their domain. They mechanically elaborate
the artistic creation of their human masters. AARON does an extremely

good job of this.

The Myth of the Design Tradeoff
An important consequence of the non-linearity of creativity is we are not
constrained by tradeoff laws. Let me explain.
