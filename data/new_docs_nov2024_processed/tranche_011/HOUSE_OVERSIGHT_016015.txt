Schrédinger’s Cat

easurement is a big puzzle. What causes the collapse of the
Mees function so that the photon stops considering many

optional paths and makes a hard and fast decision. When light
passes through a series of glass surfaces, it is reflected or transmitted by
each. We can stack up as many pieces of glass as we want, but none of the
surfaces will cause a measurement — a collapse of the wave function. It is
not until the photon reaches a detector that a measurement is made and
all the potential reflections and transmissions that might have happened
‘collapse’ into the one choice that actually happened.

You might doubt this but there are ingenious experiments that can
be performed to prove it. One is quite simple to do and can be set up
on your kitchen table with a handheld laser and $100 worth of optical
components. You need three ordinary mirrors and a beam splitter. Beam
splitters are often made from half-silvered mirrors. They are similar to
your bedroom mirror except the silver coating is more thinly applied,
allowing only half the light to reflect while the rest passes straight
through. Arrange the mirrors and beam splitter on a table at the four
corners of an imaginary box, as in the diagram. If you point your laser at
the half-silvered mirror, half the light will go straight through and half
will be reflected upwards towards the first mirror. It is sent on around the
square until it meets the half-silvered mirror again, and the beams meet
up. You might expect that half the light reaches the detector but this is
not what happens. Depending on the way the mirrors are positioned,
either all the light reaches the detector, or none does. (The light does not
disappear it just gets sent back to the light source, energy is conserved.)
If you turn down the brightness of your laser, this does not change. Even
