Does God have
Free Will?

God. Scientists generally avoid the topic, but since we’re talking
about such a fundamental concept, we must consider whether
the Universe would be any different if it had a creator.

Recently there have been two widely publicized attacks on religious
belief from the scientific community: the head-on attack from Richard
Dawkins in The God Delusion or, the hard hitting sideswipe by Stephen
Hawking in The Universe in a Nutshell.

Hawking made the front pages in 2000 with the statement: “There
is then no need for a creator” He was considering whether God needed
to ignite the Big Bang or if it occurred as a natural result of the laws of
physics. Hawking had run the mathematics and realized a god was not
needed to light the blue touch paper for the Big Bang - the laws of physics
spontaneously caused it. His argument does not actually preclude the
existence of a god, but it does move the point where we need a creator
one step further up the chain.

This is not a fundamental change to the progress of theological
argument over the last thousand years. Once we abandon our vision
of God as a master builder, literally breathing life into Adam while
putting the finishing touches to the Garden of Eden, we can move him
up the causal chain as far as we like, eventually reaching a point where
intervention is necessary to get things started. Hawking is only pointing
out an intervention is not needed at the point of the Big Bang. It still begs
