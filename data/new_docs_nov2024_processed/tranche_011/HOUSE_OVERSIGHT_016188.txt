On a multiples basis, we value Almarai on 21x 2017E EPS, a 15% premium to Global
(blue chip) food producer averages. We believe that at this level it is fairly valued given
it is trading at a premium to its historical trading average and the weaker consumer
outlook.

Our DCF analysis yields a valuation of SAR59/share, based on a WACC of 8% and
terminal growth rate of 3.5%.

Risks to our PO are company specific factors such as plant outages, disease outbreaks
in its biological assets, delays in the investment program and factors affecting suppliers.
Macro level risks are commodity prices, government regulation, subsidy removals and
price pressures from growing competition.

BAE SYSTEMS (BAESF / BAESY)

Our PO of 600p (US$34.26/ADR) is an average based on DCF, 2016-17E P/E and
EV/EBITA and Sum-of-Parts. We regard as BAE's peers Lockheed Martin, LLL, General
Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, QinetiQ, Cobham, Ultra Electronics.

Our DCF valuation (8.7% WACC and 1.8% long-term growth rate in line with defence
peers and 10.7% long term margin) implies a 550p share price. Our SOP suggests at
valuation range of 592-595p, using peer group EV/EBITA multiples of 12.7-13.7x and
EV/sales of 1.2x. Applying EU and US peers multiples on EV/EBITA and P/E yields a
valuation range of 671-679p.

At 600p BAE would be trading on 14.6x 2016E P/E and at 13.9x 2016E EV/EBITA. This
P/E is in the middle of the historical range of c.20x to c.6x, and the EV/EBITA is near the
high end of the historical range of c.12x to c.4x.

Upside risks are: 1) An export contract for Typhoons, in particular an order for 60+
airplanes from Saudi, 2) USD strength against the UK, 3) development of a large scale
and long term conflict.

Downside risks are: 1) significant decrease to the US or UK defence budgets, below our
current assumptions, 2) significant weakness of the USS vs Sterling.

Dallah Healthcare (XJEFF)

We set a SAR79 price objective for Dallah, which is equivalent to 23x FY17E EPS. We
expect earnings to double between FY15A and FY20E as beds triple. The multiple
therefore falls quickly and on FY20E earnings, when some of this growth is likely to
have come through, the stock trades in-line with other hospital stocks, both EM and
Saudi.

Upside risks are: greater price increases than assumed in forecasts, faster uptake of
new capacity, accretive M&A activity.

Down side risks are: Slowdown in the economy, lower-than-expected growth resulting
from delays in executing on expansion plans, inability to raise prices to offset cost
inflation, failure to manage growth without impacting margins

Dar Al Arkan (XARKF)

Our PO of SAR7.0/share is based on sum-of-the-parts methodology. We

employ a WACC of 10.7%, derived from a COE and COD of 11.1% and 9.0%,
respectively. Our SOTP includes (1) the NPV of the current development portfolio
to 2016E, (2) the NPV of recurring cash flows from investment portfolio + the NPV
of its terminal value minus incremental capex to complete the investment
programme, (3) the NPV of land sales from the developed land bank, and (4) the
book value (valued at cost) of DAAR s remaining land bank.

Downside risks: (1) Deterioration of demand for land would increase

the perceived liquidity risk (2) Deterioration of credit environment (3) Emergence
