This would not, unfortunately, be the High Court’s last word on the subject. Chief Justice
Berger, in his dissenting opinion, provided the states with a roadmap as to how to draft death
penalty statutes that might pass constitutional muster with a majority of the justices. What ensued
was a constitutional ping pong match between proponents of capital punishment and abolitionists;
the proponents would draft new statutes, and the abolitionist lawyers would challenge them in
court. Justice Goldberg, now in private practice, and I continued to play a role in this back-and-
forth life and death conflict by writing joint articles for newspapers and law reviews. Then I was
given and opportunity to participate directly in the court battle, in a dramatic and controversial
case called Tison v. Arizona, whose story I will now tell.
