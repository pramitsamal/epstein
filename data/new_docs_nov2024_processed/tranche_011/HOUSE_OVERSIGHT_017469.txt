My only “crime”

I can think of only one crime that I may have committed in my life, and I know that if I had been
tried for it, I would not only have been acquitted, but the jurors would have cheered me.

It occurred after my son, Elon, had serious brain surgery for a life threatening illness. He was 10
years old and the bravest person I ever met. Shortly after the surgery, he went back to work
selling newspapers in the subway station at Harvard Square. One day two young hoodlums from
Somerville beat him up, broke his tooth and stole the few dollars he had earned. A local
policeman, Frank Burns, who knew Harvard Square like the back of his hand, immediately
recognized the MO of the thugs and arrested the two youths (“youts”—remember My Cousin
Vinny!)

Several days later, the two thugs came back to Harvard Square, robbed my son again and told
him that unless he withdrew his complaint, they would throw him in front of a moving train. He
called me and I ran to the square, where I saw the two thugs taking a victory lap. I approached
them and I said I have only two words to say to you. I then mentioned the name of a man on
whose case I was then consulting. Although the charge against him involved marijuana
trafficking, the man himself was known to be a notorious hit man for one of Boston’s most violent
gangs. I told the two youths that if they ever came near my son again, I would tell my client and
that my client would do anything for me. The two thugs got down on their hands and knees and
pleaded with me not to tell my client what they had done. They never came back. I never told
my client, indeed I had never met my client, and still haven’t. I was just consulting with another
lawyer on a constitutional issue related to the case. But simply mentioning his name terrorized
the thugs. I’m not sure whether what I did was a crime. But I would do it again if anyone ever
threatened any of my children.
