Gigi Jordan

I am currently representing a woman named Gigi Jordan, who admittedly killed her 8 year old
severely autistic child and tried to take her own life at the same time. There is considerable
evidence that her child was being sexually abused by his biological father and Gigi was in great
fear that her former husband was trying to kill her. If he succeeded, she believed that her autistic
child would be left at the mercy of his sexually abusive father. Gigi decided that this horrible
choice of evils required her to protect her child in the only way she knew how: by ending his life
along with hers. We are in the process of preparing for her trial.
