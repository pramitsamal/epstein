IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)

Defendants either dispute the manner in
which they were served or were not served
in the United States. Accordingly, the
Court must consider an alternative basis
for personal jurisdiction.

[43] If the New York long-arm statute
or the ATA does not establish personal
jurisdiction, the Court will engage in a
Rule 4(k)@) analysis. Rule 4(k)(@) states:

If the exercise of jurisdiction is consis-

tent with the Constitution and laws of

the United States, serving a summons or
filing a waiver of service is also effective,
with respect to claims arising under fed-
eral law, to establish personal jurisdic-
tion over the person of any defendant
who is not subject to the jurisdiction of
the courts of general jurisdiction of any
state.
Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2). Rule 4(k)@) “fill[s] a
gap in the enforcement of federal law” for
courts to exercise personal jurisdiction
over defendants with sufficient contacts
with the United States generally, but in-
sufficient contacts with any one state in
particular. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)@) advisory
committee’s note; United States v. Int'l
Bhd. of Teamsters, 945 F.Supp. 609, 616-
17 (S.D.N.Y.1996). For jurisdiction under
Rule 4(k)(2), there must be a federal claim,
personal jurisdiction must not exist over
the defendant in New York or any other
state, and the defendant must have suffi-
cient contacts with the United States as a
whole such that the exercise of jurisdiction
does not violate Fifth Amendment due pro-
cess. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 945 F.Supp.
at 617.

a. Purposefully Directed Activities

Theory

Personal jurisdiction based on Rule 4(k)
requires minimum contacts with the Unit-
ed States to satisfy Fifth Amendment due
process requirements. Plaintiffs claim
these requirements are met because De-

fendants purposefully directed their activi-
ties at the United States. Burger King v.
Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472, 479, 105
8.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (explain-
ing jurisdiction is appropriate if defendant
“purposefully directed his activities at resi-
dents of the forum and the litigation re-
sults from alleged injuries that arise out of
or relate to those activities” and finding
minimum contacts existed since dispute
arose from a contract with substantial con-
tacts with the forum) (internal quotations
and citations omitted); Calder v. Jones,
465 U.S. 783, 789, 104 S.Ct. 1482, 79
L.Ed.2d 804 (1984) (finding personal juris-
diction appropriate over non-resident de-
fendants who “expressly aimed” intention-
ally tortious conduct at residents of forum
state, even where defendants were never
physically present in forum); see also Da-
ventree, 349 F.Supp.2d 736 at 762-63, 2004
WL 2997881, at *22 (finding exercise of
personal jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2) is
appropriate if defendants “purposefully di-
rected their activities at residents of the
forum, and the litigation results from al-
leged injuries that arise out of or related
to those activities”). Pursuant to the hold-
ings in Burger King, Calder, and three
recent terrorism cases—Rein v. Socialist
People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 995
F.Supp. 325 (E.D.N.Y.1998), Daliberti v.
Republic of Iraq, 97 F.Supp.2d 38 (D.D.C.
2000), and Pugh v. Socialist People’s Lib-
yan Arab Jamahiriya, 290 F.Supp.2d 54
(D.D.C.2003)—Plaintiffs submit that the
moving Defendants knew that the primary
target of Osama bin Laden’s and al Qae-
da’s campaign of terror was the United
States and that by providing assistance to
these terrorists, who Plaintiffs claim were
Defendants’ co-conspirators, Defendants
aimed their conduct at the United States.

In Rein, the court denied defendants’
motions to dismiss for lack of subject mat-
ter and personal jurisdiction in a case aris-
