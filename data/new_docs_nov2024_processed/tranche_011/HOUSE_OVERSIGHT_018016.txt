Alan Dershowitz says he's still advising Jeffrey Epstein

Alan Dershowitz still provides legal advice to serial pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, he confirmed to Axios.

What he's saying: He has called me a couple of times about legal issues, because I'm still technically
his lawyer,” Dershowitz told me in a phone interview on Saturday. But I haven't had any social, or any

other kind of contact. ... You never stop being a person's lawyer.

Background: Dershowitz helped Epstein get a sweetheart plea deal from then-U.S. Attorney

Alexander Acosta (now Donald Trump's labor secretary and a rumored long-shot contender for attorney

general).

¢ A bombshell Miami Herald investigative series last week highlighted for the first time the extent of

Epstein's alleged crimes and the soft treatment he received from federal prosecutors.

¢ The Palm Beach multimillionaire would serve just 13 months in the county jail, but the deal —
called a non-prosecution agreement — essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether
there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein’s sex crimes,
according to a Miami Herald examination of thousands of emails, court documents and FBI

records.
