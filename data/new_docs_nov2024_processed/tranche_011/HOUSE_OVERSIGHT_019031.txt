On January 27, 2006, I made telephone contact with Christina Venero,
at ol Venero is a licensed massage therapist who had
frequented the home of Jeffrey Epstein. Ms. Venero has been unable to

meet with me in Palm Beach County, and because she lives and works in
Port St Lucie, a telephone interview was conducted. I explained to.
Ms. Venero that there was an on going investigation involving Jeffrey
Epstein.

Venero stated she knows Epstein and has been employed by him for
approximately three years. Epstein has paid Venero to perform Swedish
Massages (Deep Tissue) on him and other guests. Venero explained that
approximately three year ago she met Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey
Epstein through a mutual friend. Epstein and Maxwell were looking for
a massage therapist. Venero stated since that time, she is notified
when Epstein is coming to Palm Beach. Venero stated she comes to his
house and provides the massage or massages. Venero explained she has
also massaged his guests and assistants. Venero continued that she is
paid $100.00 and hour for the massage.

I asked Venero if anything occurred during the massage that would have
made her feel uncomfortable. Venero stated she only provided massages
and that was it. She never was approached for anything else. I asked
if Bpstein ever asked her to rub his chest she stated she would not
rub his chest as that is not part of her massage. enero explained
that she was not Epstein's ‘type. The girls she would see at Epstein's
house were very thin, beautiful and without tattoos. Venero explained
she has several tattoos that are visible. Maxwell and Epstein have
commented negatively about her tattoos previously when she has
provided massages.
