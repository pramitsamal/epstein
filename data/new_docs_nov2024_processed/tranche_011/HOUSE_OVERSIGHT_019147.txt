Michael Reiter: September 2005

here’s a sense in which the Palm Beach PD functions as a

foundation. From time to time, one of the town’s wealthy

residents will walk in with a check followed by an inquiry.
How much more would the police force need to make this
remarkably safe community feel even safer?

A tax write-off? Sure. But why not? Coming from most, it’s a
genuine gesture. One of appreciation for all they have and for all
the department's efforts to guard it. Donations are accepted gra-
ciously, gratefully. In 2004, the department had taken one from
Jeffrey Epstein—the second donation he’d made to the Palm
Beach PD—for ninety thousand dollars. Generous, even by the
generous standards of Palm Beach. The donation, which Epstein
delivered personally, was earmarked for a firearms training sim-
ulator. But that day Michael Reiter had thought something seemed
off about Epstein.
