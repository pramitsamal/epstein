In Palm Beach, he lived in luxu-

garage, alongside a green Harley-

at Palm Beach International Airport:
At home, a private chef and a small
staff stood at the ready. From a

way and the West Palm Beach sky-

leave them frustrated.

Palm Beach police and the state
attorney’s office have declined to
discuss the case. But a Palm Beach
police report detailing the criminal
probe offers a window into what
detectives faced as they sought to
close in on Epstein.

Detectives interviewed the girl,
who told them a friend had invited
her to a rich man’s house to perform
a massage. She said the friend told
her to say she was 18 if asked. At the
house, she said she was paid $300
after stripping to her panties and
massaging the man while he mas-
turbated. ‘

Police interview 5 alleged victims

The investigation began in full
after the girl identified Epstein in a
photo as the man who had paid her.
Police arranged for garbage trucks
to set aside Epstein’s trash so police
could sift through it. They set up a
video camera to record the comings
and goings at his home. They mon-
itored an airport hangar for signs of
his private jet’s arrivals and depar-
tures.

They quickly learned that the
woman who took the 14-year-old girl
to Epstein’s house was Haley Rob-
son, a Palm Beach Community Col-
lege student from Loxahatchee. Ina
sworn statement at police head-
quarters, Robson, then 18, admitted
she had taken at least six girls to visit
Epstein, all between the ages of 14
and 16, Epstein paid her for each
visit, she said.

During the drive back to her
house, Robson told detectives, “I’m
like a Heidi Fleiss.”

Police interviewed five alleged
victims and 17 witnesses. Their
report shows some of the girls said
they had been instructed to have sex
with another woman in front of
Epstein, and one said she had direct
intercourse with him.

In October, police searched the
Paim Beach mansion. They discov-
ered photos ofnaked, young-looking
females, just as several of the girls
had described in interviews. Hidden
cameras were found in the garage
area and inside a clock on Epstein’s
desk, alongside a girl’s high school
transcript.

Two of Epstein’s former
employees told investigators that
young-looking girls showed up to
perform massages two or three
times a day when Epstein was in
town.

They said the girls were permit
ted many indulgences. A chef
cooked for them. Workers gave
them rides and handed out hun-
dreds of dollars at a time.

One employee told detectives he
was told to send a dozen. roses to one
teenage girl after a high school
drama performance. Others were
given rental cars. One, according to
police, received a $200 Christmas
bonus.

The cops moved to cement their
case. But as they tried to tighten the
noose, they encountered other
forces at work.

In Orlando they interviewed a
possible victim who told them noth-
ing inappropriate had happened
between her and Epstein. They
asked her whether she had spoken
to anyone else. She said yes, a pri-
vate investigator had asked her the
same questions.

When they subpoenaed one of
Epstein’s former employees, he told
them the same thing.
vate eye had metatarestaurant days
earlier to go over what the man
would tell investigators.

Detectives received complaints
that private eyes were posing as
police officers. When they told
Epstein’s local attorney, Guy Frons-
tin, he said the investigators worked
for Roy Black, the high-powered

Miami lawyer who has defended the |

likes of Rush Linbaugh and William
Kennedy Smith.

While the private eyes were
conducting a parallel investigation,
Dershowitz, the Harvard law pro-
fessor, traveled to West Palm Beach
with information about the girls.
From their own profiles on the pop-
ular Web site MySpace.com, he
obtained copies of their discussions
about their use of alcohol and mari-
juana,

He took his research to a meet-
ing with prosecutors. in early 2006,
where he soughtto cast doubt onthe
teens’ reliability.
