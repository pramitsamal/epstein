The Great Divide | 133

such as “patriot” and “traitor” that have tended to fill the gap in
the great divide do little to address the important mystery of how
many thousands of state secrets were taken from the United States.
How did Snowden breach the supposedly formidable defenses of the
NSA? Did he have any assistance? How did he escape to Moscow?
And what was the final destination of the stolen documents? How
Snowden succeeded in this coup cannot simply be pieced together
from his own statements and interviews. The story also requires a
visit into the wilderness of mirrors of a counterintelligence investi-
gation. For this endeavor, it is necessary to return to the crime scene:
the NSA’s base in Hawaii.
