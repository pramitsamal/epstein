CHAPTER 15
Did Snowden Act Alone?

When you look at the totality of Snowden’s actions certainly one

somebody who was very competent in these matters.

WHISTLE-BLOWER enters the enterprise of stealing state

secrets for reasons of conscience, but so do many spies. Such
conscience-driven spies are called, in CIA parlance, “ideological
agents.” For instance, the British diplomat Donald Maclean, one
of the most important Russian spies in the Cold War, was an ide-
ological recruit. He stole immensely valuable U.S. nuclear secrets
for the Russian intelligence service without receiving any monetary
compensation.

The acceptance of money is not necessarily a meaningful dis-
tinction when it comes to espionage. To be sure, many spies get
paid, but some whistle-blowers also receive a rich bounty for their
work. Indeed, under federal laws, whistle-blowers can qualify for
multimillion-dollar bounties for exposing financial malfeasance. The
whistle-blower Bradley Birkenfeld, for example, after he himself
was paroled from prison in 2012, received an award of $104 million
for providing data that exposed illicit tax sheltering at the Swiss UBS
bank. Assange also offered political whistle-blowers six-figure cash
