306 | Acknowledgments

Because I do not believe an investigative book should be written
without the author visiting the crime scene and other pertinent ven-
ues, I undertook research in Hawaii, Japan, Hong Kong, and Moscow.
Where possible, I flew the same flights that Snowden did. I am grate-
ful to Ena and Ines Talakic for their assistance on these research trips.
As talented documentarians in their own right, they filmed a num-
ber of my interviews on these trips, and generously provided pho-
tographs for this book. I thank Alexander Bitter in Hawaii, Joyce Xu
in Hong Kong, Ko Shoiya in Japan, and Zamir Gotta, Natalie Filkina,
and Svetlana Chervonnaya in Russia for their help in arranging my
interviews in those places. I also owe special thanks to Nick Grube,
an editor at Civil Beat in Honolulu, for accompanying me to the
NSA base where Snowden was working in 2013.

I am indebted to Nancy Novick for her skill, patience and enter-
prise in helping me find the selection of photographs for this book.

lam grateful to Zachary Gresham for his meticulous fact-checking
and proofreading, and to Ingrid Sterner for her immensely helpful
copyediting skills. Because I perform all my own research, I alone am

© responsible for any errors that appear in this book. ®

Mort Janklow, who has represented me for three decades, did a
superb job in arranging for Alfred A. Knopf to publish this book.

Tam thankful to Julia Ringo and the team at Knopf for their help
in preparing this book. Finally, I am deeply indebted to Jonathan
Segal for meticulously editing this book. The manuscript gained
immeasurably from both his keen eye and his wise judgment.
