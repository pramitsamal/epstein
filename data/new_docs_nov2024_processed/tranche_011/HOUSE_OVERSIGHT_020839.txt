Improving operating efficiency.

With nearly one government civilian worker (federal, state and local) for every six households,
efficiency gains seem possible. A 20-year trend line of declining federal civilian headcount was
reversed in the late 1990s.

Resuming that trend would imply a 15% potential headcount reduction over five years and save
nearly $300 billion over the next ten years. USA Inc. could also focus intensively on local private
company outsourcing, where state and local governments are finding real productivity gains.

Improving long-term GDP growth — productivity and employment.

Fundamentally, federal revenues depend on GDP growth and related tax levies on consumers
and businesses. Higher GDP growth won't be easy to achieve as households rebuild savings in
the aftermath of a recession. To break even without changing expense levels or tax policies,
USA Inc. would need real GDP growth of 6-7% in F2012-14 and 4-5% in F2015-20, according to
our estimates based on CBO data — highly unlikely, given 40-year average GDP growth of 3%.
While USA Inc. could temporarily increase government spending and investment to make up for
lower private demand in the near term, the country needs policies that foster productivity and
employment gains for sustainable long-term economic growth.

Productivity gains and increased employment each contributed roughly half of the long-term
GDP growth between 1970 and 2009, per the National Bureau of Economic Research. Since the
1960s, as more resources have gone to entitlements and interest payments, USA Inc. has
scaled back its investment in technology R&D and infrastructure as percentages of GDP.
Competitors are making these investments. India plans to double infrastructure spending as a
percent of GDP by 2013, and its tertiary (college) educated population will double over the next
ten years, according to Morgan Stanley analysts, enabling its GDP growth to accelerate to 9-
10% annually by 2015 (China’s annual GDP growth is forecast to remain near 8% by 2015).
USA Inc. can’t match India’s demographic advantage, but technology can help.
