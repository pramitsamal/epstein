Good News: While ‘Unfunded’ Liabilities Have Helped Bankrupt Companies,

USA Inc.'s Unfunded Liabilities are Not Legal Contracts

e Medicare / Social Security — While beneficiaries have a legal
entitlement to receive benefits as set forth under the Social Security Act,
Congress has the legal authority to change the levels of benefits
and/or the conditions under which they are paid. Congress’s
authority to modify provisions of the Social Security program was
affirmed in the 1960 Supreme Court decision in Flemming v. Nestor,
wherein the Court held that an individual does not have an accrued
“property right” in Social Security benefits. The Court has made clear in
subsequent decisions that the payment of Social Security taxes conveys
no contractual rights to Social Security benefits.

Medicaid — Benefit levels & eligibility are determined jointly by Federal

and State governments. Federal funding is met through an appropriation
by Congress (and can be adjusted annually).
