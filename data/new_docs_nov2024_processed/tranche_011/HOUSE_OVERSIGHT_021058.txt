...Good News for GM Is It Has ‘Taken Its Medicine’ and Has

Begun to Implement a Successful Turnaround

Basic Framework of GM Turnaround:

e Focus on Expenses

— Eliminated some of the legacy entitlements - swapped employee
healthcare for equity ownership.

— Significantly changed operating efficiency - took out costs so that GM
was able to operate at breakeven at bottom of the cycle and turn cash
flow positive during other parts of its business cycle.

e Focus on Revenue

— Changed business model to move away from lowering cost to
improving vehicle quality, engineering and styling.
