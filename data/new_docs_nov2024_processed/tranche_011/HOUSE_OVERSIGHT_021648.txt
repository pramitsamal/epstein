The Associated Press
NEW YORK — A billionaire

investor, already facing jail

in Palm Beach County on
charges of soliciting under.
age prostitutes, is being sued
by a young woman who says
he had ‘sex with her when
she was 16 and had sought
his help becoming a model.
The lawsuit, filed late
Tuesday in Manhattan's state
Supreme Court, says finan-
cier Jeffrey Epstein had the
teen perform a sex act when
she brought
photographs
of herself
for him to
review in his
Upper East
Side mansion
sometime in
2000.
Epstein,
54, a money
manager,
told the teen he manage

finances for Victoria's Secret’

and “could get you into the
catalog” if she were “nice”
to him, court papers say.
The papers say being “nice”
included massages and other
favors.

When the girl told Epstein,
‘T am 16 years old and just
want to model,” he replied,
‘Don’t worry, I won't tell any-
body,” court papers say.

Epstein, said by London's

Mail on Sunday to be a close
friend of England's Prince
Andrew, has been indicted in
Palm Beach on charges of so-
liciting underage prostitutes.
That case is:pending.

The girl visited Epstein
“several times over the sev-
eral months and engaged in
bizarre and unnatural sex
acts” while she was a minor,
the lawsuit says.

Epstein “repeatedly re-
quested that (the girl) return
with her 14-, 15-, and 16-
year-old girlfriends, stating,
‘Come by with your friends
your age next time. Don't
bring Sherrie @ mutual
friend in her 40s). I love girls
your age.’”

_ The young woman, now
23, kept returning to Epstein
because she has “mental
issues,” said her lawyer, Wil-
liam J. Unroch. He refused to
elaborate, but court papers
say she was “disabled as a re-
sult of severe mental disease
and defect.”

Epstein’s lawyer in New
York, Gerald Lefcourt, said,
“The girl has admitted she
is insane, but she can read a
newspaper and recognize the
word ‘rich.’”

Lefcourt also said the
statute of limitations has
expired for the woman's
case criminally and _ civilly,
and will almost certainly be

He refused to comment on
Epstein’s Florida charges.

Meanwhile, .Unroch, _5/,
also acknowledged that his
client was living with him
and was at the center of a $10
million lawsuit he filed last
year against a neighbor who
said he was having sex with
underage girls. That case is
pending.

“What she was doing at
22 is irrelevant to what hap-
pened to her when she was
16,” Unroch said Wednesday.
He went on the say he hoped
Epstein would agree to “do
right” by his client and re-
soive the case out of court.
