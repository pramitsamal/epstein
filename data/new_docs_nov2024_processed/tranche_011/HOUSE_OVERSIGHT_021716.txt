U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra is set to decide in the coming
days whether the rights of two alleged victims of Palm Beach sex
offender Jeffrey Epstein were violated when the U.S. Attorney’s
Office failed to confer with them before signing a non-prosecution
agreement in September 2007.

Attorneys Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, representing Jane Doe
No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2, argued Friday in federal court in West
Palm Beach that the governmeni’s action violated the girls’ rights
under the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act.

Edwards and Cassell want the agreement nullified and want Marra to
unseal un-redacted plea deal correspondence between the U.S.
Attorney's Office and Epstein’s defense team. If he agrees, that
action could spur a federal case that might expose Epstein to a
longer incarceration if convicted.

After Palm Beach police received a complaint about Epstein in spring
2005, more than 30 young women participated in civil lawsuits that
alleged he lured them to his home for sexually charged rubdowns
and/or sex in exchange for cash when they were minors. Some
cases were dismissed, and others were settled.
