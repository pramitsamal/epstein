Q. My question had nothing to do with whether
you could identify girls that Jeffrey Epstein abused.

My question was: As of December 30th, 2014 -- you don't
have to give me the name right now -- is there any
specific girl that you had evidence Professor Dershowitz
abused?

A. What I had was the police report moving girls
and the girls were named in the police report, although
the police report that I think has been made public has
the names redacted, those girls were moving through the
mansion at the time when, for example, household staff
were saying that Mr. Dershowitz was receiving massages.

And so, yes, I have 24 names in mind as
possible sexual abuse victims that Dershowitz may or may
not have abused. And I have not been able to pinpoint
exactly what happened, because the people who would be
in the best position to help me sort out what the names
were, specifically Jeffrey Epstein among others, have
refused to cooperate and give me those names.

MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike the

nonresponsive portion of the answer.

THE WITNESS: Can I ask what part of that was

nonresponsive in your view?

MR. SCAROLA: That's all right.

THE WITNESS: Okay.
