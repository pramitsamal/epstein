Debt limit. The debt limit will be reinstated after March
15, 2017, though Congress willlikely have additional time
to either suspend or increase the limit. Extraordinary
measuresthat can be undertaken by the Treasury
Department should allow Treasury to continue meeting its
financial obligations until at least midsummer of 2017,
according to a September 13 posting by the Bipartisan
Policy Center. When the debt limit is reinstated, the
federal government’s accumulated debt will immediately
equal the new ceiling, which is projected to be

about $20.1 trillion. The optics of the figure surpassing
$20 trillion could spur lawmakersto be even more
adamant about demands for spending cuts in return for
supporting an additional increase or suspension of the
debt limit.

FAA reauthorization. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund
taxes expire after September 30, 2017, along with
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spending authority,
both of which were last extended in July. Privatization of
the air traffic control system was a sticking point in
negotiationsthis year. The FAA bill can be a vehicle for
other tax legislation.

Personnel. The fact that Trump has not held political
office and is not a traditional Republican puts a new spin
on filling out his administration. Press reports have
speculated about potential cabinet appointments. Trump
has reportedly said that Goldman Sachs alumnus and
campaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin could bea
possible nominee for Treasury secretary.

Economic advisers that have represented Trump on the
campaign include investor Wilbur Ross and economists
Peter Navarro, Larry Kudlow, and Stephen Moore.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is in charge of Trump’s
transition. Politicians who have supported and served as
surrogates for Trump and could possibly be tapped for
Cabinet posts include: former New York mayor Rudy
Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senator
Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Dr. Ben Carson, and former Alaska
Governor Sarah Palin. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) was reportedly
under consideration for the vice presidential pick and
could be tapped for a Cabinet post.
