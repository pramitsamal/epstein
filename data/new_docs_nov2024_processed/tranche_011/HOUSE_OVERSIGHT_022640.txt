I’m definitely not surprised. Consider that Monica Lewinski was 22 at the time she first had sex with him (and
he was more than double her age at the time, considering he was 49 years old), I can see where his bent for the
young was already manifesting itself.

Remember back to the good ole days when the Secret Servants used to be a law enforcement agency known as
the Secret Service. Of course back then even the democrats has some sense of honor and/or discretion.

Muslimluvchrist...Remember...now don’t forget! Let’s not forget one of the highlights of his presidency,
signing NAFTA, which resulted in America losing countless businesses that provided jobs for Americans,
which we still suffer from.
