Subject: Filing in Epstein case

Hi Prof. Dershowitz:
I’ve been following the Jeffrey Epstein litigation saga on and off for some time.

When I checked the federal court docket last night, I came across the attached filing. It makes some serious
allegations about you and several other people related to the case.

I wanted to make sure you had a copy of the filing and to ask if you have any comments on the allegations
raised in it.

I’m planning to write a blog entry or story on this and will probably do so fairly soon since the filing is a
public record at this point.

Anyway, if you want to respond, please let me know as soon as possible.
Thanks
