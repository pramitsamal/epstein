Epstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price
of oil and to the politics of the Middle East, entertained
that evening a delegation from Qatar, including Sheikh
Hamad Bin Jassim, the foreign minister. Hamad ,
indeed, lives across the street in a similarly furnished
house—he and Epstein have the same decorator.
Epstein, in his relaxed and amused manner, kept
prodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What
do you get out of that?” The Qatarians, in some mild
diplomatic discomfort, seemed most worried that their
bid for the World Cup might be compromised by
bribery allegations.

At 9 the next morning, Epstein was joined for
breakfast in the dining room by Reid Weingarten, who’s
represented, among other fat cats in trouble,
Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd
Blankfein, and is one of attorney general Eric Holder’s
closest friends. Weingarten, hoarse, with a cold, and
dejected, is just back from a failed defense of former
Connecticut Governor John Rowland.

After a blow by blow of the trial, there’s a
discussion of the Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving
chocolate made from pistachios grown on the Sheikh’s
farm—and speculation about who actually controls
ISIS, with Weingarten arguing that the Turks are not
getting enough scrutiny (he posits that ISIS is part of
their proxy war against the Kurds). There is, in
Epstein’s dining room, always an alternative version of
world events—” “perception versus reality,” says
