January: Virginia Roberts files court papers in Florida claiming that she was
forced by Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew and lawyer Alan Dershowitz when
she was underage. In a sworn affidavit, she provides photographs of her with the
prince and with Epstein’s close associate, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. She
claims Maxwell worked as Epstein’s madam, which she denies. Dershowitz and the
prince deny her claims as well, setting off a series of legal actions between
Dershowitz and Roberts’ attorneys that are later resolved in an out-of-court
settlement.

April: A federal judge rules that Roberts cannot join the federal Crime Victims’
Rights Act lawsuit and that her affidavit — accusing Prince Andrew and Dershowitz
of having sex with her when she was underage — be stricken from the case.
Dershowitz said the ruling meant he was vindicated. However, the judge does not
address the veracity of Roberts’ claims, writing: “The factual details regarding with
whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and
impertinent to this central claim.”

September: Roberts sues Maxwell in federal court in New York, claiming that
Epstein’s alleged madam defamed her in public statements in the media. The
lawsuit is widely viewed as a vessel for Epstein’s victims to expose the scope of
Epstein’s crimes. Several civil lawsuits filed the same year allege that Epstein and
Maxwell operated an international sex trafficking operation.
