would take us 2 years to be ready to edit the footage anyway (The online course is chronological. When I
taped Woody we were still back in 1730. Now we've gotten to the 1920s)

Well, we've now arrived at the season when we'll be editing materials on William Carlos Williams for our
course on Modernism and, as we discussed on Saturday, on poetry and other arts, The Poetry of Art, Sport,
and Play

I would also, of course, love to make a tv episode out of the conversation, but the threshold question is
whether he'll let us use it for anything at all. In case it would matter,

Other performers who have already taped with me include

John Lithgow,
Diane Paulus
Julie Taymor
Nas

Eve Ensler
Damian Woetzel
Kate Burton

Lil Buck Riley
Alfre Woodard
Herbie Hancock
Tony Kushner

and those who have agreed to tape with me include

Sally Field

Lena Dunham

Yo Yo Ma

Anna Deveare Smith
and more.

Those in other fields include journalists, senators, president clinton ete etc. You've read my pitch before
(many times)

His is one of only two releases that we haven't gotten. What do you think of my chances?
