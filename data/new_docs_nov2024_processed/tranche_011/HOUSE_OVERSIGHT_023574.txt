Trump-Clinton debate.

I was joking in one sense, but not in another. Why is the initiative so significant?
From the global perspective, poverty, under-development, and vast inequalities are
deep, seemingly intractable problems — and economic development, catalyzed by
infrastructure construction, is an essential part of the solutions.

From China's perspective, after decades of remarkable growth, economic
transformation is necessary, and this includes geographical rebalancing within China
and expanding China's trade by enhancing globalization.

All of these can be achieved by the initiative, but only if formulated synergistically
and implemented assiduously. There are substantial challenges, of course —
economic, financial, structural, political instability, nationalism, terrorism and, in

certain circles, suspicion of China's motives.

But for sure, the world has great need and China has a grand plan in the Belt and
Road Initiative.
