BofAML GFSI™ X-Asset Risk Landscape

GFSI below ‘normal’ for longest period since summer 2014

The GFSI continued its decline last week, falling to -0.21 as of 2-Jun from -0.17 a week
prior. The indicator last spent a significant proportion of time below -0.2 back in
summer 2014, when cross asset volatility recorded long term lows.

+ Equity risks led the broad based decline in stress across asset classes
(Chart 2 and Chart 3), led by equity skew.

¢ While most stresses fell, crude oil volatility was among the top gainers
(Chart 2) as oil continued its slide despite the May OPEC meeting seeing
agreement for extending production cuts.

- Also, Euro member bond spreads recorded a historically significant move
higher (Chart 5) as the potential for early Italian elections causing political
instability amidst ECB tapering revived concerns about European sovereign risk
