Enel stock attractive vs credit given cheap bullish risky & high div yield vs CDS

On 31-May-17, we recommended buying SX5E bullish risk reversals and selling IBOXX
HY TRS as a low carry / low risk trade with gearing to improving earnings and FCF. We
now look for similar opportunities at the single name level. Among the 50 companies
which have high projected 12m dividend yield relative to bond yields (as highlighted by
BofAML credit and equity strategists — Chart 9), we highlight a subset (15 names) where
we have option data since at least Jun-12 (last 5yrs). The names in the bottom-right
corner of Chart 31 indicate the cheapest 3m -25d put/+25delta call risk-reversals where
projected dividend yield is highest relative to the CDS spread. We note that:

« Royal Dutch Shell’s stock yield is attractive vs CDS: Shell’s projected 12m div
yield is 7.5% while its CDS is 52bps (0.5%), resulting in a div yield-CDS spread of
7.0%, the highest in our screen; this suggests value in Shell equity vs credit.

¢ Cheap bullish risk reversals in Enel and Iberdrola: 3m -25delta put/+25delta call
risk reversals in Enel and Iberdrola are the lowest across the 15 names in Chart 31.
Notably, bullish risk reversals in Enel are also particularly cheap versus history as
the price of 3m -95%f / +105%f bullish risk reversals is below its 5 5-y %-ile.
