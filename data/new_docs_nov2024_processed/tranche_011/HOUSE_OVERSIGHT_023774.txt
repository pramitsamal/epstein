28 Teaching Minds

Here is the same woman, this time writing about how she learned
music,

My mentor, Otto-Werner Mueller, was conducting the Yale
Philharmonia in the 1970s—I met him as an undergrad in
Madison, WI. I attended his graduate seminars in Madison and
spent a lot of time with him while he was in New Haven. He
guest-conducted the Hartford Symphony (where I now work)
twice in the past few years. (He is 83 now.) I spent hours and
hours in “lab orchestra” watching him teach his conducting
students, both in Madison and at Yale. What always struck

me was how students were either so self-conscious they were
wooden, or how they’d try to imitate Otto (who at 6 feet, 7
inches had amazing stature) physically and couldn’t pull it off.
Very few were able to incorporate what he was teaching and then
make it their own.

students look at what the teacher does and see how they can
imitate it in a way that is consonant with who they are

a major university.

Trust your intuitions. This was something you told many of

us over and over. It has had three meanings for me—first, that
the only right things to work on are those that I can imagine a
solution to; second, that whether a way of attacking something
is the right way or not, it will lead me to the right way; and
third, go out on a limb. I can’t say how I learned this except,
perhaps, through trusting your advice and then noticing that it
got me to success over and over again. It began to really sink in
when I had my own students. Often, the most interesting things
they brought to me were more intuitive than they were based
on what everyone else was saying. And I have had to reassure
people that their ideas are good and they should follow up on
them. Of course, there are also intuitions that my students have
that I don’t think are good, and I don’t advise them to follow
