It's hard to imagine, but true: Summer will slip away before you know it. Which means it's time for a mini-getaway to one of
your favorite cities. And this is the time to go - the streets are quieter, the parks are in bloom and concerts, movies and
performances are staged nearly every day. We've got last-minute availability at the Landmark London and three Manhattan
standouts: the elegant Hétel Plaza Athénée, the family-friendly Roger Williams and the Uber-sleek Thompson LES. Choosing
can be tough when the options are so good.
