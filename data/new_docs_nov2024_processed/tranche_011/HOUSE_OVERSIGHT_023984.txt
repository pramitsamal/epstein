Known as Napa of the North, Canada's Okanagan region is a year-
round retreat east of Vancouver. The area is home to award-winning
wineries, Canada's warmest lake and a stunning desert landscape fit for
golfing virtually every day of the year. With exceptional service and
Pueblo-style architecture, Spirit Ridge Vineyard Resort & Spa is just as
much a hotel for oenophiles looking to unwind as it is for golf fanatics
and families looking to take advantage of mild weather and myriad
activities.
