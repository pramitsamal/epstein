Grenada is known as the most gregarious of the Caribbean islands,
and Maca Bana, on a secluded cove on the Point Salines peninsula,
represents a microcosm of that, from the general manager to the
gardener. The boutique villa hotel (appropriately named after a tree in
the indigenous Arawak language) has an infinity pool and beachside

restaurant to entertain, plus each villa has a deck with a private hot tub.

And even though the resort is just five minutes from the airport, it feels
worlds away.
