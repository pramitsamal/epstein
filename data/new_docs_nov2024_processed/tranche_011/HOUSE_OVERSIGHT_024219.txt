outperformance rallies lasting over 1.5 years, on average, and outperforming the Topix by 30-40%

During the Jan 97-Nov 98 policy error period, fundamental investors bid up the better prospects
(Tokyo Electric Power and Osaka Gas each rose 34%) while the Topix declined by -19. During this
same period, some Japanese utilities also posted sharp absolute declines, such as Hokkaido Gas -49%,
Saibu Gas -30% and Okinawa Electric -27%. During the May 01-May 03 policy error period, Okinawa
Electric and Hokkaido Gas rallied +40% and +23%, respectively, while the Topix declined -44% and
Tokyo Electric Power and Osaka Gas declined -13% and -7%, respectively.

The Japanese utility experience is very interesting as several economists question whether the US is
currently committing similar policy errors while deleveraging is still occurring in the private sector
(e.g. the US just increased income and payroll taxes and is implementing austerity measures). The
Japanese experience demonstrates the potential for strong outperformance rallies during periods of
deleveraging, demonstrating the alpha opportunity arising from an influx of fundamental investors
into the sector after periods of limited interest.

o Potential for Yield Catch-up

Unlike other income-oriented investments such as Treasuries, German bunds, UK gilts, investment-
grade bonds, high-yield bonds, emerging market bonds and MLPs, all of which have rallied strongly —
some believe as the result of a yield bubble — the global utility sector has been left behind; yet
certain parts offer a compelling investment yield opportunity today. If some fixed income cross-over
investors become more concerned about inflation (because of economic growth), yet continue to be
squeezed by the QE programs of the Fed, BOE, BOJ, etc., then they could begin shifting into global
utilities. This seems logical, as such investors would look for the closest bond proxies in the equity
market, the utility sector, rather than bypass utilities for high-beta broad market stocks. Given the
enormous amounts of capital controlled by fixed income cross-over investors, even a small
reweighting could have a significant effect in bidding utility stock prices up and yields down.
