Global Utility White Paper CONFIDENTIAL

They are in a capital-intensive business and need to preserve deep, low-cost access to both the equity
and debt capital markets. Moreover, collateral requirements for forward power price hedging
typically will spike if a utility loses its investment grade rating, which can spur concern about liquidity.

Building conviction around a dividend cut thesis requires more than screening. Our process focuses
on researching capex flexibility, cost-cutting potential and asset divestiture potential to determine
the flexibility a company has under various scenarios. Our research process breaks capex into 3
buckets: i) committed capex (e.g. required by the regulator), ii) nondiscretionary capex (e.g. major
plant overhauls — CEOs tend to avoid delays so as not to jeopardize billion dollar-plus assets), and iii)
discretionary capex (CEOs can delay but may jeopardize future growth).

Regarding opex, we look for cost-cutting capability, which we estimate by breaking apart the opex
line or by global benchmarking. Finally, we estimate the potential impact from possible asset
divestitures and the resulting impact on earnings and leverage. Once we have completed the
research work on capex, opex and potential divestitures, we model various sensitivities from
structural changes or other key drivers that might cause a deterioration or improvement in a utility
company’s business model against forward-looking credit rating agency (S&P, Moody’s, etc.) ratios.
