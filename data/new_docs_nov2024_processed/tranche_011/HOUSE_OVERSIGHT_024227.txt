Global Utility White Paper CONFIDENTIAL

e §=Utility Value Chain

The electricity value chain for a modern day fully integrated utility consists of Generation + Transmission
+ Distribution + Customers (see diagram below). Each segment of the value chain is a different business,
with distinct risks and economic drivers. Competition has surfaced in each part of the value chain other
than transmission and distribution (which are fully-regulated assets as they are deemed to be natural
monopolies). Still, regulators have learned to bring indirect competition even to monopoly-regulated
businesses by encouraging returns based on efficiency improvements or benchmarking to comparable
companies.
