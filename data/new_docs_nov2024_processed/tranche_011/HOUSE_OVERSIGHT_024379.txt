living as any kind of a writer, let alone a “rock journalist.” and

Jules was one of the people who did it first. He died of a
heart attack on November 17, 2012 at the age of 77. He was

COMIX
Art Spiegelman tells me his work at Cava/rer 50 years ago:

| was first invited into the mag to do two full-color comix
pages in 1969 (when being printed in color was a Very Big Deal
for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing),
somehow in proximity to a big article on underground comix. It
was around the time Vaughn Bode was made a _ regular
contributor to the magazine, They were running some Crumb
“Fritz the Cat” pages. All thanks to their hip, laid back and kind
editor, Alan LeMond.

| also did some gag cartoons, short strips and occasional
illustrations for Cava/rer(one especially bad drawing for a story by
Bruce Jay Friedman, | recall). My work as an apprentice

underground cartoonist taking too many drugs was really, really
