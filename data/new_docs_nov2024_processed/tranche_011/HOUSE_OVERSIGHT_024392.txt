The war being waged has two components - mental and physical. The mental side is a minefield of constructs, deeply
implanted within generations of Americans, and its PC chickens are coming home to roost. So much so, millions of
Americans (westerners) cannot break free of its shackles. But it is not as if these mental chains magically appe ared. Far

from it - http://adinakutnicki.com/2012/11/26/the-death-of-...

In addition, the fault-lines of democracy allowed for the most retrograde forces, on this planet, to infiltrate and

penetrate the body politic- http://adinakutnicki.com/2012/09/02/the-subversio...

IF the mental and physical constraints are not immediately removed, it is a given that western civilization will fall. Cause
and effect.

And | would think one phy sical constraint is to not let them in in the first place. By & quot;them | mean those who
have allegiance to a socio-political system disguised as a religion that seeks world dominance by man imposed
methodology/effort -- unlike Judaism and Christianity properly understood. If we are to believe, the world already has
a King and does not need a Caliph.

Ground-breaking, brilliant. There are absolutely essentially lessons to be learned from this. Buy this book, read it, study
it, and lend it to your friends and colleagues. Do it.

The fall of Rome... The fall of the 3rd Reich... The fall of Western Civilization...

oooooh... Scary!
How about the fall of humankind recorded in Genesis Chapter 3 and following?

We're ALL GONNA DIE! But will you rise with Christ?
