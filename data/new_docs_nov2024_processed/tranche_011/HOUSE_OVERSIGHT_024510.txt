Other costs recorded at the center level include rent, marketing, maintenance, utilities, transportation,
classroom and office supplies, insurance and food. KLC’s management believes its large, combined
nationwide center base gives it the ability to leverage the costs of programs and services, such as
curriculum development, training programs and other management processes.

During fiscal year 2005, KLC experienced a reduction in projected claims costs for its self-insurance
programs. However, management anticipates that premium and claims costs will continue to refiect
market forces, which are beyond KLC’s control.

The Real Estate Transaction did not affect consolidated rent expense, but resulted in an increase of
approximately $96.0 million in annual rent expense of KLC OpCo, which is leasing centers from KLC
PropCo which now has title to substantially all of KLC's owned real property.

Other Operating Expenses

KLC’'s other operating expenses include the costs associated with the field management and corporate
oversight and support of its centers and resiructuring related expenses. Labor related costs are the
largest component of KLC's general and administrative expenses.

Seasonality

New enrollments are generally highest during the traditional fall “back to schocl” period and after the
calendar year-end holidays. KLC attempts to focus its marketing efforts to support these periods of high
reenrallments. Enrollment generally decreases somewhat during the summer months and the calendar
year-end holidays.
