Controlled Substances Act

The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is a federal law enacted in 1970 that places strict legal controls
on the manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of any controlled substance listed on one
of five schedules established by the CSA. The CSA is enforced primarily by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Justice. A controlled substance may be man-
ufactured, distributed or dispensed in accordance with the CSA only by a person properly registered
