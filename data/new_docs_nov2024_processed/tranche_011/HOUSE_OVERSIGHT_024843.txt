COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019

From a consumer staples perspective, we see innovation across a host of form factors.
To analyze the category's potential, we focused on six specific consumer product
categories, including:

2

i. Nutraceuticals (tinctures, capsules, sprays, and gummy vitamins)
ii. Topicals (for targeted pain relief, like Tiger Balm)
iii. Beverages (water, energy drinks and beer)
iv. Food (including confections and bars)
v. Vapor
vi. Beauty (including skin care, serums, lotions, and bath products)
While our analysis was far from exhaustive, below we:

i. Break down the above product categories by sub-segment to benchmark
pricing, which we define as value, main, premium and super-premium,

ii. Forecast run rate revenues by vertical over the next two years,

iii. Offer company-specific detail on numerous private and public companies as
part of our research on the CBD opportunity (primarily in the U.S.).

Figure 27 Beauty Products Carry the Most Premium Pricing, While Tinctures and Gummies Offer the Best Value Proposition in Terms of Price / MG of CBD
