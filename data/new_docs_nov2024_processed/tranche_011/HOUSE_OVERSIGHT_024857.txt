Beer

2

We believe CBD infused beer can serve as a niche segment ina rapidly evolving beer
category. With core beer under pressure, a continued theme from the key manufacturers
within the space has been a focus on innovation, as well as a move away from alcohol
into low and no-alcohol offerings (ABI is targeting 20% of portfolio to be low / no alcohol
by 2025).

On the innovation front, hard seltzer looks to be resonating with consumers, which we
believe is sticky, as it offers consumers a new product and opportunity to drive
incremental drinking occasions, while checking the box from a health and wellness
standpoint. In 2018, the hard seltzer category achieved a 1% market share of the
combined beer category, which includes, core beer, cider and FMBs. If we assume that
CBD-infused beer is able to capture a modest fifth of that amount of share by 2020 (~20
bps), that could result in a revenue opportunity of over $130 mm. We have been hearing
growing interest in companies looking to combine CBD in alcoholic beer to offer potential
hangover relief.

These estimates are benchmarked to a category that has grown sales at a 1.6% CAGR
over the past three years. If we assume Nielsen provides 50% coverage of the total
category and extrapolate that growth out, total off-premise revenues should approach
$72 bn by 2020. We provide a sensitivity analysis below on the 2020 revenue
opportunity based on different levels of market share capture. We estimate every 5 bps
of share is worth $36 mm.
