COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019

- Ohio

State and local health officials in Ohio have also begun cracking down on retailers selling
CBD products, according to a recent report from the Cincinnati Enquirer. The Ohio
Department of Agriculture is reportedly ordering the “embargo” of products containing
CBD, which has forced some businesses to remove products from store shelves.

Like most states, Ohio has not yet set up regulations for hemp, which the 2018 Farm Bill
requires from each state before the manufacture and sale of certain hemp-derived

products. In the meantime, CBD sales are technically limited to one of the Ohio’s 56
licensed dispensaries, under the state’s medical marijuana program.
