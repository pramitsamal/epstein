GW’s platform allows it to produce chemotypes with precise concentrations of various
cannabinoids, and the company is testing numerous other cannabinoids. GW’s CBDV
drug is in a 10 patient investigator sponsored trial in autism spectrum disorders, and a
Phase II 100 patient placebo controlled trial in this indication began in December 2018.
GW is also investigating CBDV for use in epilepsy, though the first clinical trial was not
successful.

Zynerba studied its transdermal CBD gel ZYNOO2 in Fragile X syndrome ina 12 week
Phase || open-label study in children and adolescents. In the trial, patients were initiated
ona dose of 50mg daily with the option to titrate up to 250mg daily. The primary
endpoint was the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS) Total Score. Twenty
patients were enrolled, 18 of whom completed the 12 week treatment. At 12 weeks,
two patients were on 100mg and 16 were on 250mg. On the primary endpoint, subjects
saw an average improvement of 14.1 points (or 45.8%) from baseline (p<0.0001) with
the greatest improvements seen in social avoidance (52.9%), general anxiety (54.0%),
and manic/hyperactive behavior (p=0.0003). Twelve patients continued in a long-term
extension study out to 12 months of follow up. These patients showed statistically
significant improvements in mean % change from baseline in ADAMS Total Score, as
well. The extension trial also contributed to a more robust safety dataset. The most
common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastroenteritis (14%) and upper
respiratory tract infection (12%); no serious AEs were reported. A randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial to extend these findings to a larger population is ongoing
in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S.
