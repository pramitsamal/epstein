Daily Beast

Mideast’s Changing View of America

Randall Lane
September 8, 2011 -- Among the findings:

- An exclusive Newsweek—Daily Beast poll of 1,000 Egyptians
reveals that a majority (53 percent) doesn’t believe that al Qaeda
was responsible for the Twin Tower attacks—instead affixing
blame to Israel, the U.S. government, or an unknown entity.

- In the same survey, 62 percent either don’t believe the U.S.
killed Osama bin Laden or they aren’t sure.

- Only 11 percent of Egyptians think America cares about their
interests.

To understand America’s current standing in the Arab world 10 years
after 9/11, it’s instructive to visit Obros, a coffeehouse-cum-nightclub
in Beirut. The place is a tribute to Kennedy-era “American kitsch,”
and its 35-year-old proprietor Joulan El Aschkar displays a
sophisticated touch, from Pierre Cardin—period wallpaper to Mad
Men—worthy vintage furniture and electronics to 100 gigabytes of
forgotten '60s hits like B. J. Thomas’s “Raindrops Keep Falling on
My Head,” rotating with fully intended irony.

I’m merely there for free Wi-Fi, but when El Aschkar notices an
actual American in his shrine to America, he eagerly engages me in
conversation, then directs my laptop to his family’s website—solely
devoted to the idea that the World Trade Center attack was an inside
job perpetrated by U.S. neocons. “I just ask questions,” he shrugs
mischievously. “The American version isn’t credible.”
