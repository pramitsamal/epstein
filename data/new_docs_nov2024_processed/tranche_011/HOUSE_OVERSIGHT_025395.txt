Message: however ill stick to economic advice. you might also point out that
saudi sovereign wealth fund needed to borrow money. Vlis they mistakenly and
childishly think that the fact that they can borrow 10 billion dollars at not a very
good rate showed strength. but in fact, like their fade in the tesla mess , illustrates
they have no cash. : I think masa is japanese's for madoff

Message: the other two areas. 1. dems scream trump deregulating where mnuchin has
instituted the stricter KYC rules in history. The U S leads. how many working
class americans would put their money in Switzerland today where the banks charge YOU

75 basis points to keep it there. so many bad actors. 2, crypto needs to be
thought of similar to the internet. intl agreements . coordinated understandings
otherwise it is a ponzi scheme outside of the law
