Indeed, economist Robert E. Hall, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, laments that the years
since 2007 have been a macroeconomic disaster for the United States of an unprecedented magnitude since the Great
Depression, noting that U.S. economic output in 2013 was 13% below what the precrisis trend has predicted (46). He
is skeptical that a sudden surge in output will help the economy recover the ground it lost. Rather, a possible scenario
would be a gradual return to a precrisis growth rate, which leaves the U.S. permanently below the level of output that

precrisis trends had suggested.

Indeed, while Standard & Poor's is expecting the annual real growth rate to climb above the 3% mark in 2015. That
will be the first time since 2005 and comes after another year of subpar growth of just 2.0% expected for 2014. The
US. already has averaged a mere 1.4% over the last 10 years, through 2013. After expecting to see that long-awaited
burst of growth in 2014 of 3% at the beginning of the year, we have reduced our expectations for GDP growth back to
that 2% mark once again. We now expect the 10-year average annual growth to be about 2.5% though 2024. To put
that in perspective, five years ago, we forecasted the 10-year average annual growth rate to be 2.8%, with all yearly

rates much higher than the 2% mark.
