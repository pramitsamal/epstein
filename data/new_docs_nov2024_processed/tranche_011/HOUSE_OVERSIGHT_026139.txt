and other electronic services. IMF has demanded that the resolution of this issue as
well as the recapitalisation of other banks, as it resulted from the AQRs performed
by NBU, is a prerequisite for the disbursement of its 4th tranche which in fact was
executed successfully by the Ukrainian administration.

As a result the banking sector presented record losses in 2016 of US$6.2 billion
(Privatbank US$5.2 billion). 1Q17 is already in profit (US$220 million) and is
expected to continue increasing throughout the year.

The current landscape is that 40 banks make up the 98% of the assets, the top 20
the 90.2%, the top 10 the 74% and of which 10 the top 4 banks are state owned and
make up the 52% of the assets.

For the State Owned Banks, namely Privatbank, Oschadbank, Ukrexim and
Ukrgas, the plan is that they prepare them for sale in the medium term, in around
2-3 years. To this purpose EBRD mostly and IFC to a lesser extent has been
assisting the Government by placing directors in the Supervising Boards of these
banks, so that corporate governance is implemented.
