papers from a woman (who later dropped her lawsuit) that Donald Trump and Epstein had
raped her when she was 13, Bannon said in response to Ivanka, “What about the allegations
about her dad and that 13-year-old?”

Epstein has previously used his millions to cultivate the world’s most powerful — but has

mostly given money to Democrats.

From 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein’s private plane, dubbed “The Lolita Express,”

26 times. Epstein is close to Prince Andrew and was aregular at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago.

Trump told New York magazine of Epstein in 2002, “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with.
It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the

younger side.”

Epstein, 65, pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a teen and served 13 months

in jail.

Last year, he reportedly paid millions to settle three lawsuits filed against him by teens.
Bannon’s rep didn’t comment. A lawyer for Epstein said, “Let me ask him,” but didn’t respond

by deadline.
