Subject: January 21: A Pair of 19th Century Carved Sicilian Marble Figures of the Medici Style Lions -

Dear Mr Epstein,

Hope you are well!

Please find attached images of:

A POWERFUL AND IMPORTANT PAIR OF 19TH CENTURY FINELY CARVED SICILIAN MARBLE FIGURES OF LIONS
IN THE MANNER OF THE MEDICI LIONS

DIMENSIONS: HEIGHT 77 - 196 CMS (INCLUDING PLINTH BASES) x LENGTH 39 - 99 CMS x WIDTH 16” -41 CMS
£160,000= RETAIL

£120,000= TRADE Plus 5% Commission

THE LIONS REPRESENT 'GRAND TOUR SOUVENIR’ WORKS OF ART AND WOULD HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED TO
DECORATE THE GROUNDS OF AN HISTORICAL HOUSE

The original figures were commissioned by ‘Ferdinando | de’Medici' and were excuted by Giovanni di Scherano
Fancelli inc.1598, and accompanied by a mirror-image version by contemporary sculptor Flaminio Vacca (1538-
1605).

The original pair remained in Rome until 1789, before being moved to Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, where they can
still be seen today. The two sculptures were hugely influential in eighteenth-century Europe: copies and versions can
be found from landscape gardens to mantlepieces

The figures are museum quality.

The lots are currently located in Barnwell Manor, Barnwell, near Oundle, Peterborough, PE8 5PJ.

They are the finest examples of 19th Century 'Grand Tour Souvenir’ works of art of 16th Century sculpture outside of
a museum.

Should you require more details please do not hesitate to contact me.
Yours sincerely,

Mark Green.
