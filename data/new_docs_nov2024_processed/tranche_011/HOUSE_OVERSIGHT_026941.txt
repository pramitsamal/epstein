“It’s such an ‘80s comedienne premise, but then it was also my truth so I was trying to reconcile with
it. It’s hard to not be meta about it, because just to say ‘I’m single’ on stage. There’s something that
feels so inherently hacky about it that I feel like I have these guilt pangs and then it just becomes a
whole other bit. It’s always weird to navigate. I’ve always been in relationships for big chunks of time

and every time I come out I’m like a generation older and I don’t know what my station is.”
