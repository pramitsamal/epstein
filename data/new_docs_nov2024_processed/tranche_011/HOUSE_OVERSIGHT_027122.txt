DP: In the long term, the United States could greatly benefit Islam by
uniquely freeing the religion from government constraints and permitting
it to evolve in a positive, modern direction. But that’s the long term. Right
now, American Muslims labor under Saudi and other influences, their
institutions are extreme, and things are heading in a destructive direction.
It’s also distressing to see how non-Muslim individuals and institutions,
particularly those on the left, indulge Islamist misbehavior.

TB: How do they do that?

DP: Well, turn on the television, go to a class, follow the work of the
ACLU or the Southern Poverty Law Center, and you will see corporations,
nonprofits, and government institutions working with the Islamists,
helping promote the Islamist agenda. The American left and the Islamists
agree on what they dislike—conservatives—and, despite their profound
differences, they cooperate.

TB: Presumably some Muslims here deconvert, right?

DP: There are some conversions out of Islam, yes. And the Muslim
establishment in this country 1s quite concerned about that. But
numerically it is not a significant number.

TB: The ones who convert don’t talk about it very much?

DP: In some cases they do; they take advantage of Western freedoms to
speak their minds. They are the exceptions, though.

TB: I suspect that the decline of Christianity has encouraged Islam.

DP: Very much so, as the contrast between Europe and the United States
reveals. The hard kernel of American Christian faith, not present in
Europe, means that Islamists are far better behaved in the United States.
They see the importance of a Christian counterforce.

TB: Earlier, you mentioned Algeria. It is a big Muslim state that we
don’t hear about today.

DP: Twenty years ago Algeria was a major focus of attention. That long
ago ended, although in France coverage is still significant. Algeria is ripe
for the same kind of upheaval that we have seen in other North African
