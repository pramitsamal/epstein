Has anyone heard mention of any of this in any of the media?

If this guy was Jenna or Barbara Bush's, or better yet, Sarah Palin's
daughter's father-in- law, the news would be an everyday headline and
every detail would be reported over and over and over.

And yet liberals say there are no double standards in political
reporting.

And people are already talking about Hillary as our next
President!

And then there is possibly Chelsea for president in our
future!

The cycle never ends!

Lying and corruption seem to make Democrat
candidates more popular.
