says Danin. Israeli officials are positively
disposed towards Rawabi, but it's still taken
years to resolve sovereignty and
governance issues around necessities like
water, and a single access road. Such
Israeli inertia was apparently at the heart of
Obama's concerns back in 2010, and
sources say that the president has discussed
the issue of the access road with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
multiple occasions.

Back in Washington, I asked Masri if he
believed the Israelis understood the
potential importance of Rawabi. I really
don't know, he said. Their statements are
neutral to positive. But their actions are
neutral to negative.

And then there's the larger inertia. What
meaning does a place like Rawabi have if it
sits in the middle of a still-unresolved
conflict, or if Palestinian economic self-
improvement stands in contrast to an all-
pervading political stasis -- or even
political backsliding? Today, Rawabi is
significant because of its novelty. But if
there's a breakthrough in the Israeli-
Palestinian peace process, perhaps enabled
by a growing West Bank economy and a
permanent end in terrorism, it could take on
an importance much larger than itself.
