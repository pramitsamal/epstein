RLK: So there’s a significant impact [on the
US]. The US hope is that China will be
pressured to make changes in its policy. Now
the [tariff] policy is not just [targeting] the
trade deficit. The policies are, what are called,
China’s closed market, intellectual property
protection, industrial espionage, tech transfers
and JVs (to get the Chinese market) and
government support for tech. And for each of
these, China has responses. China says it was
doing what was appropriate under the WTO
because it was a developing country. Now that
it’s advanced, it’s opening markets.

China has a “negative list” telling people
[companies] what it cannot do, making it much
easier; China is also opening further in autos
and financial services. But they need to be
pushed more. Even economists in China
recognize that, that coming out of this, if we
have cool heads and smart brains, both sides
can be better off.

HOST: So are there other ways to do this? You
listed that Trump wants to close a trade deficit.
He’s hitting back at these closed markets. He
wants to prevent the stealing of intellectual
property. What is an effective way to do this
besides heaping these tariffs on China?
