Every night for twenty years, Irving Schwartz gets down on his knees and says, Lord, it's
me, Irving Schwartz. I'm a good Jewish boy. One time, couldn't you let me win the lottery? One
time? I'm good to my parents, I'm good to my children, I go to temple. Please, Lord, please, one
time, let me win the lottery.

He's on his knees every night for twenty years.

Lord, it's me, Irving Schwartz. Would you please let me, sometime, win the lottery?

Finally one night after twenty years, the heavens open up, and God says, Irv, if you want
to win the lottery, you've got to buy a fucking ticket.
