making public since publication was its purpose (it appeared in his
commentary in The New York Times Magazine), he said he was
“struck” and “puzzled” by the fact that “57 percent of the French
public” and, in particular, “70 percent of the Socialists” seemed to
embrace the cause of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, whereas “one might
expect” them “to be ideologically empathetic to an African hotel
maid.”

I’m not saying that Keller was among those who found the powerful
and white banker antipathetic. And I would say so even less since the

spectacular turnaround we are witnessing.

But I maintain that formulating the problem in these terms—bringing
up political categories in a debate in which they are not relevant, in a
word, introducing ideological considerations in an area with which
they have nothing to do—is, in itself, very disturbing.

And I maintain—as I have said and repeated here and elsewhere—
that the very fact of admitting that empathies of this sort can enter
into the realm of justice amounts to inventing a class justice in
reverse, no less problematic nor, ultimately, less criminal than the
former.

It’s no longer, as it once was, “bastard poor, the rich are always
right,” but rather, “rich bastards, it’s the poor and the injured who are
always, and inevitably, right.”
