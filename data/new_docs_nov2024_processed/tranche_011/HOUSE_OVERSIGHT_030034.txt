freedom, independence, and sovereignty -- at the hand of a foreign
power, namely Iran. The Syrian uprisings may have already deepened
the sectarian divide in Lebanon, raising once more the specter of civil
war and making more difficult the task of forming a new government,
a job President Michel Suleiman has entrusted to the Tripoli notable,
Najib Mikati. If Syria were overrun with internal strife, Hezbollah
would be deprived of a valuable ally -- no doubt to Israel's great
satisfaction.

Meanwhile, Turkey is deeply concerned by the Syrian disturbances:
Damascus has been the cornerstone of Ankara's ambitious Arab
policy. Turkey-Syria relations have flourished in recent years as
Turkey-Israel relations have grown cold. Prime Minister Recep
Tayyip Erdogan and his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, have
actively sought to mediate local conflicts and bring much-needed
stability to the region by forging close economic links. One of their
bold projects is the creation of an economic bloc comprising Turkey,
Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan -- already something of a reality by the
removal of visa requirements as well as by an injection of Turkish
investment and technological know-how. A power struggle in Syria
could set back this project; and regime change in Damascus would
likely put a serious dent in further Turkish initiatives.

Turkey's loss, however, may turn out to be Egypt's gain. Freed from
the stagnant rule of former President Hosni Mubarak, Cairo is now
expected to play a more active role in Arab affairs. Instead of
continuing Mubarak's policy, conducted in complicity with Israel, of
punishing Gaza and isolating its Hamas government, Egypt is
reported to be pushing for a reconciliation of the rival Palestinian
factions, Hamas and Fatah. If successful, this could help defuse the
current dangerous escalation of violence between Israel on the one
side and Hamas and still more extreme Gaza-based Palestinian
