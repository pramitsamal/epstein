However I do feel we’ve ceased the rally for you [sic] head today.

Surely the fickleminded nature of the angry few will help tie up any loose ends.

You are a unique man, Mr McFarlane.

You came to my defense today with a courage not seen in many people. How do I thank
you?

You have a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humor with
grit.

Thank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect
for your guile.

And some day I want to see an ad lib guitar run. You have all the fearlessness of Clapton.
Thank you.
Jes

I may have already had a stiff one, it’s been a long day, and I get no younger.
