The Trump circle believe those career bureaucrats are out to get them, while NSC staffers are concerned the
president isn’t up to the job and resent the politicization of the agency by appointing Bannon to the council.

Staffers fear Kushner because he’s so close to the president, and they aren’t really sure of his official role in the
White House.

For his part, Kushner is furious at reports that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has been saying he will join the
White House as part of a “second wave” after the president’s son-in-law got him banished from the transition
team as retribution for prosecuting his father.

Sources said Trump often asks simple questions about his job, and he usually changes the subject when
discussions become too detail-oriented to make it seem as if he’s in control, said one senior government official.

Trump prefers to hand off detailed questions to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, or to chief strategist Steve
Bannon or House Speaker Paul Ryan, the website reported.

Those sources also revealed that Trump has privately expressed disbelief that judges, bureaucrats and
lawmakers are able to halt him from filling government positions or implementing policies.

“He doesn’t like this sh*t,” a source told Politico, referring to the difficulties Trump faced in getting one of his
top fundraisers, Anthony Scaramucci, appointed to a job in the West Wing.

However, sources said Trump appears to enjoy showing visitors around the Oval Office, where he spends most
of his working hours, and keeping tabs on how his staffers look on TV news.
