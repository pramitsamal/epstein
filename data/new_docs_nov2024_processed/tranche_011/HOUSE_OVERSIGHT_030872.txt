wonder Trump told him, “It’s an honor to be with you.” Now Putin wanted new Obama’s sanctions on Russia to

be reprieved.

National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had discussed it with the Russian ambassador a month before Trump
took office. Although General Flynn joined his campaign and shared criminal secrets, he denied them to the FBI.
It was a felony offense. The Justice Department warned Trump that Flynn had misled Mike Pence, and that Flynt
could be vulnerable to blackmail. Trump asked Flynn to resign, and yet he offered his job back when he got out
of prison. Why? Because Flynt was the scapegoat, taking the fall for the president and vice-president. He preferred

a trial with immunity since they knew. Pence said Flynt lied and that itself was a lie.

If Trump and Pence were both to be kicked out of the White House, the next in line would be the Speaker of the
House, Paul Ryan. Steve Bannon has described him as “a limp-dick motherfucker who was born in a petri dish at

the Heritage Foundation.” It takes one to know one. Indeed, Bannon said he wanted to destroy Ryan.

Hallelujah!
