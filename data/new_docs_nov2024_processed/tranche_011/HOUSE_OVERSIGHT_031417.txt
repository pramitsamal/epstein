Martin G. Weinberg, an attorney for Epstein, said in a statement that
Epstein’s plea was “fairly negotiated by experienced teams of
attorneys representing each party.”

“It was anything but a sweetheart deal,” Weinberg said. “And it was
carefully and fully reviewed not only by senior prosecutors within the
Southern District of Florida Office but also at multiple levels of the
Department of Justice in D.C.”

The government, he said, “avoided litigation risks including the risks of
an acquittal and Mr. Epstein went to jail, served a period of probation,
lived up to each and every obligation under the Agreement, and has
fully conformed his conduct to the law for well over 10 years.”
