India's next prime minister: The Modi era
begins

May 18th 2014 -- IN THE days since May 16th when Narendra Modi and
his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stormed to victory in India’s general
election much commentary has wrestled with the idea of history. Most
commentators seem to agree that May 2014 marks an historic moment.
One reason is the scale of Mr Modi’s landslide victory, which scooped up
282 seats for the BJP and thus an absolute majority in parliament. That is
first time since 1984 that any party has won a majority for itself. It is also
the first time ever that a party other than Congress has done so.
Conversely, the defeat for Congress is far worse than anything in its long
history of dominating Indian politics: it won fewer than a sixth the seats of
its rival, getting just 44. In much of north India, the political heartland,
Congress was wiped out. Some correctly ask if its eventual recovery
(assuming that will happen one day) would require being rid of the Nehru-
Gandhi dynasty that has been at its heart for so long.

Yet the size of Mr Modi’s victory, and Congress’s defeat, tells only part of
the dramatic story. The immense dissatisfaction with Congress was
undeniable. Voters were unhappy with high inflation, slowing growth,
weak leadership, corruption and much more. Such voter grumpiness,
usually summed up as “anti-incumbency’”, is all but inevitable for a party
that had been in power for a decade. Yet more has happened here. Take,
for example, the utter defeat of the Bahujan Samaj Party of Mayawati, the
Dalit leader in Uttar Pradesh. She was not an incumbent and her party
