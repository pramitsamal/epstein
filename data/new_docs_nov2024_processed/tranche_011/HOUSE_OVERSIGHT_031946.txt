While the administration’s changes in tone risk upsetting a pivotal
ally where anti-American sentiment — and, in some quarters, support
for the military — runs high, they are also drawing rare praise from
activists here who say they appreciate Washington’s help.

“T think that Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton delivered a clear-cut
message to the SCAF, and I think they got that message: that the
SCAF is not an elected body and must deliver the authority and turn
over power,” said Emad Gad, an analyst at the government-financed
Al Ahram research institute and now a leader of the Social
Democratic Party.

Mr. Gad contended that over the long term such pressure could only
benefit the American relationship with a democratic Egypt. “I think
more than 50 percent of the Egyptians think the SCAF is trying to kill
the Egyptian revolution,” he said.
