Tracking Deal

A downtown L.A. company that creates GPS tracking applications for cell phones has
announced a deal to provide its friend-finding apps on Samsung smart phones.

The deal could mean more than 40 million more downloads, which would translate to increased
revenue, for GTX Corp.’s application, which is currently available for the iPhone, BlackBerry and
Android phones, said GTX Chief Executive Patrick Bertagna.

The LociMobile tracking applications send a GPS signal out to all of a person’s cell phone
contacts who use the app. Bertagna said the app can be used to meet up with friends or keep tabs
on kids.

GTX has also developed a GPS shoe for tracking Alzheimer’s patients.
