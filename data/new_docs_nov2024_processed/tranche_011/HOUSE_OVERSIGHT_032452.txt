Dear Jeffrey

Two questions.

1—do you believe the stock market will continue to climb given what we have now seen of Trump-land?
[Strictly confidential]

2—what do you think of the attached (N=1)? You do not drink or smoke, probably do not inject etc. you swim
or exercise every day, so your heartbeat is expected to be low and less variable than average. Is your ability to
predict heart rate accurately—without holding your neck or wrist—positively related to your ability to succeed
in the financial world—as the attached strongly suggests. Just give me and N=1.

Remember you asked me, what does self-knowledge have to do with anything—and here is a most intriguing
example.

I will send you a joke shortly

All best

bob
