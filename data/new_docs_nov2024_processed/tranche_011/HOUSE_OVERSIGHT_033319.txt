Trump: That is true. That is true. Well, that — no, but that is true. Mentioned it quickly, not
like, you know, and I would certainly have thought that maybe you would’ve called the
office. But that’s okay. Pll speak to Kellyanne. I am a little surprised that she wouldn’t have
told me. In fact, she just walked in. [to Kellyanne] I’m talking to Bob Woodward. He said
that he told you.

Conway: Yes.

Trump: About speaking to me. But you never told me. Why didn’t you tell me?

Conway: [inaudible].

Trump: I would’ve been very happy to speak to him. All right, so what are you going to do?
BW: Well ...

Trump: So I have another bad book coming out. Big deal.

BW: ... it goes on, and 1... What you can count on is that I’ve been very careful. And
Evelyn, are you on?

EMD: Yes.

BW: Evelyn Duffy, who’s my assistant, Mr. President.

Trump: Hello, Evelyn.

BW: She transcribed all the tapes because, with permission, I taped people for hundreds of
hours.

Trump: Good.

BW: And I think there’s nothing in this book that doesn’t come from a firsthand source. Is
that correct, Evelyn?

EMD: I believe that’s —
Trump: But are you naming names? Or do you just say sources?
BW: Yeah, well, it names real incidents, so . ..

Trump: No, but do you name sources? I mean, are you naming the people, or just say,
people have said?

BW: I say, at 2:00 on this day, the following happened, and everyone who’s there, including
yourself, is quoted. And I’m sorry I didn’t get to ask you about these . ..

Trump: I mean, you do know I’m doing a great job for the country. You do know that
NATO now is going to pay billions and billions of dollars more, as an example, than
anybody thought possible, that other presidents were unable to get more? And it was heading
downward. You do know all of the things I’ve done and things that I’m doing? I’m in the
process of making some of the greatest trade deals ever to be made. You do understand that
stuff? I mean, I hope.
