On June 3, 2019, Semyon Rosenfeld, the last living Holocaust
survivor who participated in the revolt and escape from the Sobibor
death camp, died at the age of 97 in Israel. Rosenfeld joined the Red
Army in 1940. While he was fighting the Germans, his family was
killed by the Nazis. He was captured by the Germans in 1941 and,
two years later, he was transferred to Sobibor. Rosenfeld escaped
during the revolt and survived by hiding in the woods until 1944. He
then rejoined the Red Army and participated in the capture of Berlin.

Joe Biden

Former Vice President Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., was born
November 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four
siblings. In 1953, the Biden family moved from Pennsylvania to
Claymont, Delaware. He graduated from the University of Delaware
and Syracuse Law School.

One of his first overseas visits as a senator was to Israel, on the eve
of the 1973 Yom Kippur War during which he met Golda Meir. “She
read letters and told me how this young man or woman had died and
this is their family. This went on for | don’t know how long, and | guess
she could tell | was visibly moved by this, and | was getting depressed
about it.” The Prime Minister said, “Senator, don’t look so sad....we
have a secret weapon in our confrontation in this part of the world.
And | thought she was about to lean over and tell me about a new
system or something....she said, our secret weapon, Senator, is we
have no place else to go. We have no place else to go.”
