Palm Beach Daily News 
-Palm Beach billionaire Jef-
frey Epstein, who's serving 18 
months in jail for soliciting an 
underage girl for prostitution, 
is allowed to leave the Palm 
Beach County Stockade six 
days a week on a work-release 
program. 
Teri Barbera, spokes-
woman for the Palm Beach 
County Sheriff's Office, 
confirmed that Epstein, 55, 
has been in the work-release 
program since Oct. 10. 
He works six days a week: 
Friday through Wednesday 
10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Barbera 
said via e-mail. (He) works

office, monitored on an active 
GPS system (he wears an 
ankle bracelet). Mr. Epstein 
hires a permit deputy, at his 
expense, for his own security 
at his workplace during the 
time he is out. 
Miami attorney Jeffrey 
Herman represents six young 
women who've sued Epstein, 
claiming he sexually abused 
them at his Palm Beach home 
when they were minors. 
Herman said he received 
a letter about the work-re-
lease program from the U.S. 
Attorney's Office within the 
Past few days. But Herman

Herman said. I find it incred-
ible that he's on work-release 
in the cpmunity and 
clients aren't notified of this 
and we get this left& weeks 
after the fact. 
Jack Goldberger, Epstein's 
criminal attorney, said the ar-
rangement is not unusual. 
He goes to work every 
single day and goes back to 
jail at night, just like every-
body else (in the program),! 
Goldberger said. 
Epstein pleaded guilty 
June 30 to two felony counts: 
soliciting prostitution and 
procuring 'a person under 18 
for prostitution. As part of the 
plea agreement, Epstein must

oman sues billionaire investor, 
says they had sex when she was 16 Woman sues

The Associated Press 
NEW YORK — A billionaire 
investor, already facing jail 
in Palm Beach County on 
charges of soliciting under-
age prostitutes, is being sued 
by a young woman who says 
he had 'sex With her when 
she was 16 and had sought 
his help becoming a model. 
The lawsuit, filed late 
Tuesday in Manhattan's state 
Supreme Court, says finan-
cier Jeffrey Epstein had the 
teen perform a sex act when 
she brought 
photographs 
of herself 
for him to 
review in his 
Upper East 
Side mansion 
sometime in 
2000. 
Epstein, 
Epstein 54, a money 
manager, 
told the teen he managed 
finances for Victoria's Secret' 
and could get you into the 
catalog if she were nice 
to him, court papers say. 
The papers say being nice 
included massages and other 
favors. 
When the girl told Epstein, 
I am 16 years old and just 
want to model, he replied, 
Don't worry, I won't tell any-
body, court papers say. 
Epstein, said by London's 
Mail on Sunday to be a close 
friend of England's Prince 
Andrew, has been indicted in 
Palm Beach on charges of so-
liciting underage prostitutes. 
That case is pending. 
The girl visited Epstein 
several times over the sev-
eral months and engaged in 
bizarre and unnatural sex 
acts while she was a minor, 
the lawsuit says. 
Epstein repeatedly re-
quested that (the girl) return 
with her 14-, 15-, and 16-
year-old girlfriends, stating, 
'Come by with your friends 
your age next time. Don't 
bring Sherrie (a mutual 
friend in her 40s). I love girls 
your age.' 
The young woman, now 
23, kept returning to Epstein 
because she has mental 
issues, said her lawyer, Wil-
liam J. Unroch. He refused to 
elaborate, but court papers 
say she was disabled as a re-
sult of severe mental disease 
and defect. 
Epstein's lawyer in New 
York, Gerald Lefcourt, said, 
The girl has admitted she 
is insane, but she can read a 
newspaper and recognize the 
word 'rich. 
Lefcourt also said the 
statute of limitations has 
expired for the woman's 
case criminally and civilly, 
and will almost certainly be

dismissed. 
He refused to comment on 
Epstein's Florida charges. 
Meanwhile, Unroch, 57, 
also acknowledged that his 
client was living with him 
and was at the center of a $10 
million lawsuit he filed last 
year against a neighbor who 
said he was having sex with 
underage girls. That case is 
pending. 
What she was doing at 
22 is irrelevant to what hap-
pened to her when she was 
16, Unroch said Wednesday. 
He went on the say he hoped 
Epstein would agree to do 
right by his client and re-
solve the case out of court.

Suit accuses jailed 
tycoon of sex crime 
Jeffrey Epstein is in the county stockade. 
By SUSAN SPENCER-WENDEL 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH 
— The line of civil law-
suits against billionaire 
financier Jeffrey Epstein 
has grown again, with 
the filing of at least the 
12th claim, by a young 
woman who also says 
she was lured to his Palm 
Beach mansion as a teen 
and sexually abused. 
Prominent Miami at-
torney Robert Josefsberg 
filed the most recent 
federal lawsuit last week, 
on behalf of the Jane Doe 
101 who allegedly visited 
Epstein a few times while 
17 years old and was paid 
$200 at least once for her 
time there, according to 
the complaint 
The lawsuit mirrors 
facts alleged in other 
suits: that Epstein had a 
predilection for teenage 
girls, identified poor, 
vulnerable ones and 
lured them to his home 
via other young women. 
The teens describe as-
cending a staircase lined 
with nude photographs 
of young girls and to the 
spa room where Epstein 
would appear in a small 
towel. 
Miami attorney Adam 
Horowitz, who repre-
sents six other Jane 
Does, said Monday that 
the cases are still in the 
discovery process, 
with plaintiffs request-
ing from Epstein phone 
records, pictures, videos. 
Horowitz said Epstein is 
refusing to turn over the 
materials, citing a Fifth 
Amendment right not to 
do so. Stonewalling and 
delaying, Horowitz said. 
I'm not surprised. 
Horowitz said he has 
asked U.S. District Judge 
Kenneth Marra to order 
Epstein to turn over the 
information. 
A local attorney for 
Epstein, Jack Goldberger, 
did not respond to a re-
quest seeking comment. 
Epstein was jailed 
in July 2008 following a 
plea deal where he was 
sentenced to 18 months 
in jail for solicitation of 
prostitution and procur-
ing a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitu-
tion and must register 
as a sex offender. He is 
serving his sentence at 
the Palm Beach County 
Stockade, according to 
jail records, and is due 
out in September.

Women 
want sex 
plea deal 
unsealed 
Their attorneys will ask a judge 
to open Jeffrey Epstein's records. 
By SUSAN SPENdER-WENDEL 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — When wealthy 
money manager Jeffrey Epstein of Palm 
Beach pleaded guilty last year to pro-
curing teens for prostitution, his case 
detoured around local and 
state rules regarding the 
sealing of court documents. 
At a plea conference on 
the state charges, a judge, 
a defense lawyer and a pros- - 
ecutor huddled at the bench 
and decided that a deal Epstein 
Epstein had.struck with federal prosecu-
tors to avoid charges should be sealed, 
according to a transcript of the hearing. 
And so it was. 
But Florida rules of judicial admin-
istration, as well as rules of the Palm 
Beach County court system, require 
public notification that a court document 
.has been or will be sealed, meaning kept 
from public view. The 'rules also require a 
judge to find a significant reason to seal,

'4A THE PALM BEACH POST • WEDNESDAY, JUNE 10, 2009 
Public has right to know details 
of deal, Post attorney will claim 
10. EPSTEIN from IA 
such as protecting a trade 
secret or a compelling gov-
ernment interest. 
Yet no notification 
or reason occurred in 
Epstein's case, according 
to court records. 
Epstein's own attorneys, 
in federal filings, have 
referred to his confiden-
tial deferred prosecution 
agreement with the U.S, 
attorney's office, struck in 
September 2007, as un-
precedented and highly 
unusual. And it was a 
significant inducement 
for Epstein to accept the 
state's deal, observed the 
state judge who accepted 
his plea, County Judge 
Deborah Dale Pucillo. 
Epstein now faces at 
least a dozen civil lawsuits 
in federal and state courts 
filed by young women who 
said they had sex with 
him and now are seeking 
damages. 
Attorneys for some of 
those women want his 
agreement with federal 
prosecutors unsealed and 
will ask Circuit Judge Jef-
frey Colbath to do so today. 
It is against public 
policy for these documents 
to be have been sealed and 
hidden from public scrutiny. 
As a member of the public, 
E:W. has a right to have 
these documents unsealed, 
wrote former Circuit Judge 
Bill Berger, now in .private 
practice and representing 
one of the women. 
The Palm Beach Post also 
will ask Colbath to unseal 
the agreement. Post attor-
ney Deanna Shullman will 
argue that the public has a 
right to know the specifics 
of Epstein's deal. 
According to various 
media accounts, Epstein 
moved in circles that in-
cluded President Clinton, 
Donald Trump and Prince 
Andrew. International 
Moneyman of Mystery de-
clared a 2002 New York mag-
azine profile of Epstein. 
Epstein, 56, is in the 
Palm Beach County Stock-
ade, serving an 18-month 
sentence after pleading 
guilty nearly a year ago 
to felony solicitation of 
prostitution and procuring 
teenagers for prostitution. 
He is allowed out from 7 
a.m. to 11 p.m., escorted by 
a deputy said Palm Beach 
County Sheriff's Office 
spokeswoman Teri Barbera. 
During a Palm Beach 
Police Department in-
vestigation, five victims 
and 17 witnesses gave 
statements. They told of 
young women brought by 
his assistants to Epstein's 
mansion on El Brillo Way 
for massages and sexual 
activity and then being 
paid afterward. 
At Epstein's plea confer-
ence last year, his attorney, 
Jack Goldberger, and 
then-Assistant State, At-
torney Lanna Belohlavek 
approached Pucillo in 
a sidebar conference. 
Pucillo, who had left the 
bench nine years earlier, , 
was filling in temporarily 
as a senior judge. • 
According to atranscript, 
Goldberger told Pucillo that 
Epstein had entered a con-
fidential agreement with 
the U.S. attorney's office 
in which federal prosecu-
tors brokered not pursuing 
charges against him if he 
pleaded guilty in state 
court Pucillo then said she 
wanted a sealed copy of the 
agreement filed in his case, 
and Goldberger concurred 
that he wanted it sealed. 
Belohlavek later signed off 
on it 
The Florida Supreme 
Court has expressed seri-
ous cohcern and launched 
an all-out inquiry into seal-
ing procedures across the 
state following media re-
ports in 2006 of entire cases 
being sealed and disappear-
ing from court records. 
The public's donstitu-
tional right of access to court 
records must remain invio-
late, and this court is fully 
committed to safeguarding 
this right, justices wrote in 
their final report 
Epstein's office on 
Tuesday referred any 
questions to Goldberger, 
who declined to comment. 
Pucillo also has declined 
to comment °

Judge rules Epstein attorneys 
can subpoena abortion records 
By JANE MUSGRAVE 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — In 
a ,decision that could spark 
a constitutional showdown 
over privacy rights, a judge 
Tuesday gave lawyers rep-
resenting multimillionaire 
sex offender Jeffrey Ep-
stein the right to subpoena 
abortion records from 
women who are seeking 
millions in damages from 
the part-time Palm Beach 
resident. 
Palm Beach County 
Circuit Judge Donald 
Hafele said the records 
could help 'Epstein rebut 
the women's claims that 
they suffered psychologi-
cal ills after being, paid to 
give him sexually-charged 
massages at his Palm 
Beach mansion when they 
were as young as 14. • 
Hafele told Epstein's at-
torneys they couldn't go on 
a fishing expedition. The 
medical records, he said, 
can't be spught until the 
women are asked whether 
they have ever had an 
abortion, how many and' 
where. Further, he said, 
the records would not be

The judge says 
the records 
would not be 
made public. 
made public and might not 
be admissible during trial. 
But, he said, since the 
women claim Epstein, 
now 57, is responsible for 
their emotional distress, 
his attorneys can explore 
the impact of other events. 
Medical records; Hafele 
said, are a better source 
of information than a 
person's memory 
Attorney Louis Silver, 
,who represents the Presi-
dential Women's Health 
Center, a West Palm Beach 
clinic where abortions are 
performed, warned Hafele 
that he was stepping 
on shaky constitutional 
grounds. 
These records are 
protected by our consti-
tutional right of privacy 
he said, referring to the 
Florida Constitution. 
After the. hearing, Sil-
ver said an appeal won't be 
necessary until Epstein at-
torneys seek the records. 
In another ruling 
Wednesday, Hafele also 
said that videos from 
depositions in the state 
cases can't be released 
without a court order. The 
ruling came after Epstein 
attorney Robert Critton. 
complaitied that a video 
of Epstein being asked 
whether he had an egg-
shaped penis became a 
youtube.com sensation. It 
first appeared on The Palm 
Beach Post Web site. 
Critton blamed attorney 
Spencer Kuvin for releas-
ing it. Kuvin said it was 
'public record. • 
The civil suits began 
mounting after Epstein 
agreed to plead guilty to 
two state charges: procur-
ing a minor for prostitution 
and soliciting prostitution. 
He served 13 months of 
an 18-month sentence. As 
part of the deal brokered 
with federal prosecutors, 
he agreed not to contest 
the accusations in the civil ' 
lawsuits. He can argue the 
women don't deserve the 
millions they are seeking.

Epstein NivEsr PALM BEACH — 
Papers A former employee of sex-
listed Palm scandal-plagued Jeffrey Ep-
Beach sex stein has been charged with 
offender's obstruction of justice after the

— Rodriguez calling it the 
Holy Grail or Golden Nug-

affidavit. 
The affidavit does not refer 
to Epstein by name, either 
In early November, an 
undercover FBI agent wat; 
sent it to make the buy from 
Rodriguez. Rodriguez, born 
in 195„ had told police that 
he wiled for Epstein as a

Information could have altered case

affidavit. 
Rodriguez told agents of witness-
ing nude girls whom he believed to 
be underage at Epstein 's pool area, 
of knowing that his former employ-
er was having sex with underage 
girls, and of viewing underage por-
nography on computers in Epstein's 
home. • 
• Special Agent Christina Pryor 
wrote that later review of the papers 
and book Rodriguez handed over 
revealed information that would 
have been extremely useful in 
investigating and prosecuting the 
case, including names and contact 
information of material witnesses 
and additional victims. 
Had those items been produced 
in response to inquiries of state law 
enforcement officers or the Special 
\ Agents, their contents would have 
been presented to the federal grand 
jury, Pryor wrote. 
The information allegedly with-
held by Rodriguez may have been 
a tipping point in the controversial 
probe of Epstein. Federal prosecu-
tors ended up striking an extraor-
dinary deal with Epstein and his 
top-flight lawyers: agreeing to rccall 
grand jury subpoenas if Epstein 
pleaded guilty to prostitution-
related felonies in state court, which 
he ultimately did. 
Epstein received an 18-month jail 
sentence. He served 13 months and 
was allowed to leave the jail most 
waking hours of the day. • 
An attorney for Rodriguez, Assis-
tant Federal Public Defender Dave 
Brannon, declined to comment on 
his behalf 
An unnamed government witness 
mentioned in the affidavit is likely 
one of the attorneys representing 
women in a gaggle of current civil 
lawsuits against Epstein. 
The affidavit outlines ,how the 
unnamed witness had deposed 
Rodriguez, who denied having docu-
ments, then received a call from 
Rodriguez later offering to sell for 
$50,000 the Holy Grail. 
Rodriguez explained that the 
information contained hundreds of 
additional victims and their phone 
numbers from diverse geographic 
locations including New York, New 
Mexico and Paris, according to the 
affidavit. 
Rodriguez is scheduled to be ar-
raigned in federal court Monday. 
Also in the affidavit are the 
reasons Rodriguez cited to the un-
named witness for why he withheld 
the lists from investigators: He con-
sidered it his property and should 
be compensated for it, and he feared 
the target of the federal investiga-
tion, Epstein, would make him dis-
appear or otherwise harm him.

The Billionaire Pedophile's Sex Den 
by Conchita Same 
July 22,2010 11:46pm 
The Daily Beast reveals new details about the twisted sex life of 
Jeffrey Epstein and his penchant for underage girls. Conchita 
Sarnoff on his massages, sex toys, and questionable deals. Also: 
• Nude images of young girls were scattered around the house and the 
bathroom soap was shaped like sex organs 
• Staff trolled for fresh recruits to make sure Epstein had two or three 
massage appointments each day 
• The house manager has been sentenced to a longer prison term than 
Epstein—for trying to sell notes regarding massage appointments 
• Epstein gave $1 million to his friend Jean Luc Brunel when he was starting the modeling agency MC2 
• According to a former bookkeeper, young girls were brought to the U.S. by MC2—often from Eastern 
Europe—then traveled on Epstein's private jets 
Newscom 
Jeffrey Epstein's loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously lenient. They insist 
that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and essentially harmless. As the police 
records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could say no at any time during a massage 
as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in every victim's statement: First 
she would be asked to remove her shirt, then her pants. He would attempt to fondle her buttocks and breasts as he 
masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator. There was sometimes digital penetration, and the more willing girls were 
lured into full-blown sexual relations with both Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova, who was referred to in press accounts 
and police reports as Epstein's live-in sex slave. 
A former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls 
traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on 
Epstein's private jets. 
It's true that some underage. girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily several 
times—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of the contact, 
particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this case—judging by arrangements 
at the Palm Beach house—is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organized his life around this sexual 
compulsion in an open and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law.

According to police who executed a search warrant, the house was 
decorated with large, framed photos of nude young girls, and similar 
images were found stashed in an armoire and on the computers seized 
at the house (although police found only bare cables where other 
computers had been). Some bathrooms were stocked with soap in the

shape of sex organs, and various sex toys, such as a twin torpedo vibrator and creams and lubricants available at 
erotic specialty shops, were stowed near the massage tables set up in several rooms upstairs. 
Epstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, and 
Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be 
charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties, 
worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily massages was stocked with fresh recruits. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years 
Epstein's live-in partner, also recruited young girls. 
Since his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits 
brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each 
received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth. 
The victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave 
them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was 
a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled 
towels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of 
him with a young girl. 
Ironically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced to more jail 
time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein's activities. He was fired, he says, for 
inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money. 
He saw an unfamiliar beater in the driveway one evening and called 911. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriguez 
took away some notes and emails about massage appointments as protection against his own prosecution, and 
failed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation. 
Unable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this golden 
nugget—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an 
undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with obstruction of official proceedings for withholding information 
that could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal. 
Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach 
county jail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms, 
another deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job. 
In a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000 in cash on 
hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them 
to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in 
return was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by 
local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to earlier 
donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given 
the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The police were still researching the purchase when 
Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein's local attorneys, 
told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was very passionate 
about massages being therapeutically and spiritually beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage 
training.) 
Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, owner 
of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova deliberately engaged in a 
pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in 
sexual play for money. (Which would amount to trafficking.) 
Brunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He lives in 
New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, Miami, and Tel

Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been observed as a house guest at 
Epstein's Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New York, where Epstein owns a lavish 
home—the city's largest private residence—and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch. 
CBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated MC2 for a 60 Minutes broadcast several years ago, is quoted in Michael 
Gross' book about the modeling industry, Bad and Beautiful. Pyes told the author that Brunel ranks among the 
sleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking about a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls 
were not only harassed but molested. Now The Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire 
transfer to Brunel's offshore bank account in September 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift 
or a loan or a backdoor investment in the new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving 
evidence in the Epstein investigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April of 
Brunel's activities, Epstein said I'm 100 percent convinced that he doesn't traffic children. (Brunel has never been 
charged.) 
An American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very beautiful; many 
were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency's Miami office, who also 
arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein's private 
jets. 
Pilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests. Other times, 
the pilot would just list the other passengers plus female.

Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free

Hedge fund mogul Jeffrey Epstein became a free man Wednesday, five years after he was first 
accused of sexually abusing underage girls. After months of reporting, The Daily Beast's 
Conchita Sarnoff reveals exclusive details of the investigation and the legal wrangling that saved 
him from a long prison term. She reports: 
• Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein's special treatment and gave The Daily Beast an 
exclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation. 
• Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have 
landed Epstein in prison for 20 years. 
• Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former 
Soviet republics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift. 
• The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be 
evidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was 
convicted of. 
• Epstein's attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered 
private investigators to follow and intimidate the victims' families; one even posed as a police officer. 
• Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he would have instructed the 
Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess. 
Film director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of 
privilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach, 
which has been even less arduous than Polanski's time at a Swiss ski chalet. 
During Epstein's term of house arrest, he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private 
Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor-13 months in the Palm 
Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled more than a dozen 
lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform massages at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven 
victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an 
amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth. 
With that, the known victims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is 
closed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of the U.S. and 
may well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile.

But the question remains: Did Epstein's wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince Andrew; 
former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry 
Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him to receive only a slap on the 
wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hitting 
lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among 
them—to escape equal justice? 
Michael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to 
the transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims' civil suits, in which he explained how the case against Epstein 
was minimized by the State Attorney's Office, then bargained down by the U.S. Department of Justice, all in an 
atmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several 
colleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2009 and now runs his own security firm, objected both to Epstein's plea 
agreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the 
deposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered yes. 
In March 2005, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a 14-year-old girl, launched an 
investigation that would eventually uncover a pattern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning 
several continents, knowingly enabled by Epstein's associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever 
Epstein was in Palm Beach, a teenage girl would be brought to the mansion on El Brillo Way. (The younger the 
better, he instructed Haley Robson, a local teenager who was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who 
declared, on a police tape, that she was like a Heidi Fleiss, the infamous California madam.) Advised that she would 
be giving a massage, the girl was then pressured to remove her clothes, submit to fondling and a large vibrator, and 
sometimes lured into more invasive sexual contact. Each girl was paid $200 or more, depending on how far things 
went, by house manager Alfredo Rodriguez, who was instructed always to have $2,000 cash on hand. 
The Palm Beach Police Department identified 17 local girls who had contact with Epstein before the age of consent; 
the youngest was 14, and many were younger than 16. And that was just at one of Epstein's many homes around the 
world—he also owns property in New York, Santa Fe, Paris, London, and the Caribbean. Subsequent investigation by 
the FBI, reaching as far back as 2001, indentified roughly 40 victims, not counting Nadia Marcinkova, whom Epstein 
referred to as his Yugoslavian sex slave because he had imported her from the Balkans at age 14. Now 24,

Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire oophile, Goes Free - The Daily Beast Page 3 of 4 
Marcinkova became a member of the household and is alleged to have participated in the sexual contact with 
underage girls. 
Epstein quickly got wind of the investigation, and progress on the case got messy very quickly. He hired a squad of 
lawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead, 
local detectives pressed on and brought the matter to the attention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal 
colleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared to have traveled out of state on Epstein's planes—plus the 
use of interstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2000 Trafficking Victims 
Protection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 20 years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2002.) 
So when State Attorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida's Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant to 
mount a vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the 
attorney a letter complaining of the state's highly unusual conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case. 
He did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting 
prostitution. (Krischer has since retired and would not comment for this article.) The day after that indictment was 
returned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation. 
The details that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year, 
according to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three 12-year-old girls from France, who were molested 
then flown back to Europe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America, 
Europe, and the former Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruited for Esptein's sexual pleasure. 
According to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency owned by Jean Luc 
Brunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein's. Brunel received $1 million from the billionaire around 
the time he started the agency. 
The non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four 
members of his staff were investigated for knowingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing 
and obtaining by any means a person, knowing that person has not yet obtained the age of 18 years and would be 
caused to engage in commercial sex act—that is, child sex trafficking. Yet the agreement allowed Epstein to plead 
guilty to only two lower-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor child for prostitution. 
Although the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against 
Epstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal, 
and that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed to bankroll their civil 
lawsuits. Attorney Dershowitz says Epstein's agreement to pay attorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage 
claims—without admitting guilt—amounted to extortion under threat of criminal prosecution. 
But exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there 
were several earlier versions of the U.S Attorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been 
convicted, could have landed Epstein in prison for 20 years. Brad Edwards, attorney for seven of the victims, confirms 
the existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that 
Epstein committed, at some point, to a 10-year federal sentence. But in the end Epstein's legal team refused that 
deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was winnable before a 
jury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Attorney's Office, which shared the state attorney's view 
that the prosecution was far from a slam dunk. 
For one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran lawyers, 
whose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton's relationship with an intern, would play rough. 
When the Palm Beach police started to identify victims, according to Detective Joe Recarey's report, Dershowitz 
began sending the detective Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that some of these girls were no angels. 
Reiter's deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershowitz had launched background 
checks on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershowitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and 
Recarey also became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knowing who ordered it. 
And the Florida victims began to complain that they and family members were being followed and intimidated by 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-07-20/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2010 
Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire ilophile, Goes Free - The Daily Beast • Page 4 of 4 
private investigators who were then linked to local attorneys in Epstein's employ. In one reported instance, the private 
investigator claimed to be a police officer, and Reiter considered filing witness-tampering charges. 
The credibility of the victims was also an issue; they had never complained of their treatment by Epstein until they 
were contacted by police, and they may have voluntarily returned to the Palm Beach mansion several times. Many of 
the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epstein's cash, 
intimidation, and charm. Those who were 16 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 20s by the time 
they took the stand, and Epstein's investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts. 
According to an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage 
parlors known as jack shacks. Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Attorney's 
Office, where staff met frequently with Epstein's lawyers. 
The Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age 
of 18 commits a felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is 
no defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of consent. For a child under 16, even lewd 
behavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous 
crime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It 
wasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein's crack legal team, who 
repeatedly noted that the age of consent is lower in many other states. 
But that doesn't quite explain why the Department of Justice would forgo the child-trafficking charges, which pertain 
regardless of a girl's attitude or character. Epstein's final sentence is so out of line with the statutory guidelines for that 
crime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many powerful friends and 
attorneys. A highly intelligent man who once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors 
degree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philanthropy. He has 
made substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $30 
million to Harvard University. 
Moreover, many of his high-powered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein's private jets, for which the pilot 
logs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes showed that bold-face names were on the same flights as 
underage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson 
and Bill Clinton's wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered to give 
evidence was heating up. Alberto Gonzales, who was U.S. attorney general throughout most of the Epstein 
investigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he would 
have instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess. But that may have been an 
impossible mandate, given the players involved. 
Instead, said attorney Brad Edwards, Epstein committed crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life.., he 
was jailed for only a few months. And this week he walks through his door a free man.
