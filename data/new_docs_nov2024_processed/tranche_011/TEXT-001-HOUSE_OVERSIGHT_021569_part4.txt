Prince Andrew and the 17-year-old girl his sex 
offender friend flew to Britain to meet him 
By Sharon Churcher 
Last updated at 1:02 PM on 2nd March 2011 
• Virginia Roberts reveals she is 'Jane Doe 102' in Jeffrey Epstein case 
• Mother-of-three spent four years as millionaire's personal masseuse 
• She describes being flown across world to meet Prince Andrew 
• Epstein trained her 'as a prostitute for him and his friends' 
As the UK's special representative for international trade, the Duke of York holds an important position, 
requiring sound judgement and widespread respect. 
But those qualities have been thrown into question since photographs of Prince Andrew with his 
billionaire financier friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child-sex offender who was jailed for 18 months for 
soliciting underage prostitutes, appeared last weekend. 
Today, however, even more serious doubts are cast on his suitability after a woman at the centre of the 
Epstein case revealed to The Mail on Sunday that she had, as a 17-year-old employed by Epstein, been 
flown across the world to be introduced to the Prince.

eyewitness, photographs and flight details of Epstein's private jets. 
One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew's first encounter with the girl in March 
2001 and published today by The Mail on Sunday, shows the Prince with his arm around her waist. 
This is not the first time the Duke of York's judgment and choice of associates have been questioned. He 
appears to relish the company of super-rich oil billionaires from the Middle East, North Africa and the 
former Soviet Union. 
The peculiar sale of his former marital home to a Kazakh businessman for £15 million after it had 
languished unsold for five years at £12 million has never been satisfactorily explained. 
In the recent leak of American diplomatic cables it was revealed that he had criticised an official 
corruption investigation into the huge Al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia, while he 
is also said to be close to Saif AI-Islam Gaddafi, son of the beleaguered Libyan president, and may have 
had a role in the early release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi. 
While on the streets, I slept with men for money. I 
was a paedophile's dream 
But it is Andrew's friendship with Epstein, whom he has known since at least 2000, and with Epstein's 
confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late disgraced newspaper baron Robert Maxwell, that 
gives most concern. 
He was first seen with the pair on holiday in Thailand, and was pictured cavorting with Ghislaine at a 
Halloween fetishthemed party in Manhattan. 
The photograph that appeared last weekend shows the prince strolling through Central Park with 58-
year-old Epstein. Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in December, when 
he was joined by other distinguished guests, including Woody Allen, at a dinner. 
It is by no means the first New York soiree Andrew has attended as Epstein's guest. 
A lengthy profile of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was a 
guest at a cocktail party thrown by Epstein and Maxwell packed with young Russian models. 'Some 
guests were horrified,' said the article's author, Vicky Ward. 
It should not be forgotten that Epstein is a registered sex offender after recently completing his sentence 
for offences relating to child prostitution. 
However, he avoided trial on more serious charges that carried a potential life sentence. And no one 
reading The Mail on Sunday's interview with the woman who was prepared to testify against him can be 
in any doubt of the seriousness of the charges. 
Epstein, a Wall Street money manager who once counted Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his 
friends, became the subject of an undercover investigation in 2005 after the stepmother of a 14-year old 
girl claimed she was paid $200 (£125) to give him an 'erotic massage'. 
The subsequent FBI probe uncovered at least 20 girls levelling sexual allegations against him. 
Eventually, Epstein struck a 'plea bargain' with prosecutors — a practice not permitted under British law — 
under which he was allowed to plead guilty to two relatively minor charges.

Police claim that his donations to politicians and his 'dream team' of influential lawyers deterred 
prosecutors from bringing more serious charges of sex-trafficking. The deal certainly kept the names of a 
lot of Epstein's famous friends out of an embarrassing court case. 
However, an unusual part of the agreement was that Epstein's alleged victims were allowed to bring civil 
proceedings against him. 
He has so far made 17 out-of-court settlements, and some cases are ongoing. One of these girls was to 
have been a key witness for the prosecution had the case gone to trial. She was just 15 years old when 
she was drawn into Epstein's exploitative world in 1998. 
In her civil writ against him, under the pseudonym Jane Doe 102' she alleged that her duties included 
being 'sexually exploited by Epstein's adult male peers including royalty'.

Prince Andrew and girl, 17, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him I Mail On... Page 6 of 17 
Doe 102 has agreed to waive her anonymity and tell for the first time her deeply disturbing story. 
Her real name is Virginia Roberts and she now lives in Australia, where she is a happily married mother 
of three. 
Over the course of a week during which she spoke at length to The Mail on Sunday, she appeared 
sometimes vulnerable, and sometimes steely, but always quietly resolute and consistent. 
Revisiting events from a past that she had hoped she had left behind,Virginia occasionally buried her 
face in her hands. 
Some recollections — and, for reasons of taste, not all the details can be included here — caused her to 
flush with shame. 'I'm telling you things that even my husband didn't know,' she said. 
Virginia, who has undergone counselling to try to come to terms with her past, is honest about her 
initiation into Epstein's depraved world. 
She was a troubled teenager, whose slender figure, delicate complexion, hesitant voice and soulful blue 
eyes made her look young for her years. 
Born in Sacramento, California, in August 1983, Virginia spent her early years on a small ranch on the 
West Coast of America. 
This seemingly idyllic childhood ended when she was sexually molested by a man close to her family. 
The fallout from that led to her parents temporarily splitting up. Blaming herself, Virginia began to get into 
trouble Aged 11, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away. 
Living on the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. 'I was a 
paedophile's dream,' she says. 
Three years later, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had moved 
to Palm Beach, 
Florida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump's country club, Mar-a-Lago. 
Virginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant —which is where, soon after her 15th birthday, 
she met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein's personal masseuse. 
'I was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top — when I was approached by 
Ghislaine,' Virginia says. 
'I told her I wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman who 
was looking for a travelling masseuse. 
I'd get training and be paid well.'Virginia's father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being 
handed the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer. 
He drove her to Epstein's pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also owns a nine-storey home 
in New York, the city's biggest private residence; a 7,500-acre ranch called `Zorro' in New Mexico and 
Little Saint James, a private 70- acre atoll in the US Virgin Islands.

Virginia says: 'Ghislaine said I was to start immediately and that someone would drive me home. 
My father left and I was told to go upstairs.' She was led by another woman through Epstein's bedroom 
into a massage room where he lay face down naked on a table. 
He started to interviewed Virginia. This was unconventional, but Virginia had no suspicions. Presumably, 
she thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business. 
Epstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer a virgin. 
Virginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had shown 
her in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter. 
Virginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people. 'My face was red with 
embarrassment,' she says. 'But I felt under immense pressure to please them. 
The whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I'd travel with Jeffrey on his 
private jet and have a well-paid profession.' Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to return 
the next day. 
That was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein. 
For three of those years, she was under Florida's age of consent, which is 18. 
Troubled teenager: Virginia on the billionaire's Zorro ranch in New Mexico in 2001 
Virginia was fascinated by his life story: the son of a humble New York City parks worker, he was a 
teacher before becoming a Wall Street broker and friends with the upper echelons of the political, 
financial and academic establishment. 
As a confused teenager, Virginia easily fell into the practice of sexually gratifying him for money.

He guaranteed her a minimum of $200 each time she gave him what he called an 'erotic massage.' 
Virginia said: 'I would always receive the money immediately. He would give me the cash from a wad he 
carried in a black duffel bag or an assistant paid me. 
'And, because of the way Epstein had warped her sensibilities, every time she took the cash, Virginia felt 
even more indebted to him. Secretly, he was also preparing her for an even more disturbing role. 
Epstein had trained me to do whatever men wanted. I 
told myself I was special 
'Basically, I was training to be a prostitute for him and his friends who shared his interest in young girls,' 
she says: 'After about two years, he started to ask me to entertain his friends.' 
It started when Epstein called Virginia at the Palm Beach apartment he had rented for her. 
She recalls: 'He said, I've got a good friend and I need you to fly to the island to 
entertain him, massage him and make him feel how you make me feel. 
He didn't spell out what I had to do. He didn't have to. 'He'd trained me to do whatever a man wanted. I 
was shocked but I told myself he was sharing me around because he trusted me and I was special. 
I was worried, but I would do anything to keep Jeffrey happy and to keep my place as his number one 
girl. 
He would keep telling me how lucky I was with the life I was leading and the money I was making. It was 
easy to fall into his grasp. 
'The way it usually worked was I'd be sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in the 
Caribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was really isolated.' She was 'given' to men ranging in 
age from their 40s to their 60s. 
They included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in the next room), a world-
renowned scientist, a respected liberal politician and a foreign head of state. 
None appeared to think the arrangement was unusual. Virginia says there were many other girls in 
Epstein's circle and that she was paid extra money to help recruit them.

Counselling: Virginia at her mother's home at Palm Beach in 1998 
'They would lounge around the Palm Beach house, the ranch or the island, nude or topless,' she says. 
'But I was one of the very few he trusted as special and chosen to entertain his friends.' 
Virginia took the sedative Xanax to detach herself from sordid reality. 'It was an escape drug,' she says. 
'It made me calm and helped me forget about what I had to do. I was up to eight pills a day.' 
Epstein had no objection to Virginia's use of prescription drugs, no doubt recognising that they made her 
even more malleable. 'I didn't want to go back to the life I'd had before' she says. 
'That made me totally obedient.' Despite the fact that Epstein was, essentially, her pimp, this life now 
seemed normal to Virginia. 'I felt that he and Ghislaine really cared for me,' she said. 
'We'd do family things, like watch Sex And The City and eat popcorn. 'A lot of it was very glamorous. I 
met famous friends of his such as Al Gore and Heidi Klum and Naomi Campbell. He introduced me as his 
travelling masseuse. 
Some people mistook me for his daughter. 'When we were in New York or Palm Beach, Ghislaine and I 
would shop all day. 
Jeffrey bought me jewellery — diamonds were his favourite — and wonderful furniture. He was paying me 
very well because I'd give him sex whenever he wanted it.' 
She was, she says, delighted when Epstein invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip in 2001. 
'He said we'd be going to Europe and North Africa to meet architects and interior decorators because he

wanted to redo his New Mexico house. 
I threw my arms around him and gave him a peck on the cheek.' They flew to Paris, then Spain, then 
Tangier. 
Finally, they went to London. 'After we landed, we drove straight to Ghislaine's house,' says Virginia. 'I 
was given a small upstairs bedroom. The following morning, Ghislaine came in. 
She was chirpy and jumped on the bed saying, Get up, sleepyhead. You've got a big day. We've got to 
go shopping. You need a dress as you're going to dance with a Prince tonight. 
'She said I needed to be smiley and bubbly because he was the Queen's son. 
Ghislaine and I went to Burberry, where she bought me a £5,000 bag, and to a few other designer stores 
where we bought a couple of dresses, a pair of embroidered jeans and a pink singlet, perfume and make-
up. 
We got back to Ghislaine's house at around 4pm and I ran straight upstairs to shower and dress. 
When I went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door. 
Ghislaine led Andrew in and we kissed each other on the cheek. `Ghislaine served tea from a porcelain 
pot and biscuits. She knew Sarah Ferguson and they talked fondly about Andrew's daughters. 
Then Ghislaine asked Andrew how old he thought I was and he guessed 17 and they all laughed. 
Ghislaine made a joke that I was getting too old for Jeffrey. 
She said, He'll soon have to trade her in. It was widely known that he liked young girls.' The four of 
them went out to dinner and on to Tramp nightclub where, she says, Andrew danced with her. 
'After about an hour-and-a-half, we drove back to Ghislaine's. 
All of us went upstairs and I asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince. I wanted something to 
show my Mom. Ghislaine and Jeffrey left us after that, and later Andrew left. 
'In the morning, Ghislaine said, You did well. He had fun. We flew straight back to the States.' The Mail 
on Sunday has confirmed that the tycoon's jet flew to Paris on March 6, 2001, continuing to Granada, 
Tangier and London, before returning to New York. 
On the last leg of the trip, Virginia was paid about $15,000 (£9,400) by Epstein. 'It was amazing money, 
more than I'd ever made on a trip with him before. 
He didn't say there was any special reason, but I felt like I'd done everything he wanted. He was very 
pleased.' 
I took eight pills a day to help me forget what I had 
to do. It made me calm. 
There is no suggestion that there was any sexual contact between Virginia and Andrew, or that Andrew 
knew that Epstein paid her to have sex with his friends. 
However, the Prince must have been aware of Epstein's conviction when he stayed with him in New York 
in December.

Virginia says she met Andrew for a second time around Easter 2001 at Epstein's Manhattan mansion. 
'When I got to the mansion, I was told, Get ready. You are meeting someone in the office — which is 
what they called the library. Andrew was sitting there in a big leather armchair. 
Ghislaine had just given him a present, a big toy that was his Spitting Image puppet. 'He was smiling ear-
to-ear. He looked like a kid whose parents were taking him to Disney World. 
A beautiful girl called Johanna Sjoberg who worked for Jeffrey was sitting on Andrew's knee. Ghislaine 
guided me over to Andrew and I think he recognised me, though I don't know if he remembered my 
name.

Organiser: Ghislaine Maxwell looks on as Andrew put his arm around Virginia. Robert 
Maxwell's daughter invited her to work as Epstein's personal masseuse soon after her 
15th birthday 
We kissed on the cheek and Ghislaine placed me on his other knee.' Johanna spoke to The Mail on 
Sunday three years ago about this incident, which took place when she was 21.

She said: `Ghislaine put the puppet's hand on Virginia's breast, then Andrew put his hand on my breast. It 
was a great joke. Everybody laughed.' After this, Virginia was paid, by Epstein, around $400 (£250).' 
She met Andrew for the third and final time on Epstein's Caribbean island, Little Saint James. Virginia 
was never under the British legal age of consent when she met Andrew. She was 17 during the first two 
encounters and 18 at the third. 
Conviction: Jeffrey Epstein 
By now, however, Epstein, had started to hint that she was getting 'too old' for him. 
But during one trip to the island, Epstein and Ghislaine made their most astonishing proposition, and one 
which repulsed her. 'They said Jeffrey wanted me to have his child,' she says. 
'They said I was part of their family and I was beautiful,young, loyal and nurturing and would be a great 
mother. 
They said I would have to sign a contract relinquishing rights to the child and consenting to Jeffrey having 
as many relationships as he liked. In return I would have my own mansion in Palm Beach and a large

• I 
monthly payment, a percentage of his income.' 
This, finally, was a wake-up call to Virginia and she began to see the way in which she had been 
groomed. 
'It was a smack in the face,' she says. 'I finally realised this wasn't ever going to be a real relationship but 
I knew if I refused, I'd be thrown back on the streets. So I said, I'm too young. I want to get my massage 
credentials, then maybe we'll do if.' 
The tycoon took her at her word and, for her 19th birthday in August 2002, flew her to Thailand where he 
enrolled her in a massage course. 
Shortly after arriving there, she met an Australian martial arts expert called Robert. They fell in love and, 
just ten days later, married in a Buddhist ceremony. 
'I called Jeffrey and told him I'd fallen madly in love,' Virginia says. 'I was hoping he'd be delighted. But 
he said, Have a nice life, and hung up on me.' The couple now have two sons, aged five and four, and a 
daughter who recently turned one. 
'The first few months after I married Robert were the worst,' she says. 'I couldn't bring myself to tell him 
much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out. 
'I felt very alone. I was having panic attacks and seeing a psychiatrist and was on anti-depressants. 
'Virginia was beginning to put her Epstein days behind her when, three years ago, she was phoned by 
the FBI. 
'They said they had found photos of me at Jeffrey's Palm Beach house,' she says. '[Epstein had] hidden 
cameras watching me the entire time even when I was in the bathroom. I was so embarrassed. 
'I told the FBI that my true purpose was sexual. They told me everything he did was illegal because I was 
under age.' (The age of consent in Florida is 18). 
'They said that if it had to go to trial, they'd need me because I'd lived with him and that made me a key 
witness. I was very afraid, because he had so much power, but eventually I agreed to testify. 
I was glad he'd finally been found out. He shouldn't be hurting other girls. Following Epstein's arrest, 
investigators are believed to have found a list of men's names on his computer and asked him whether 
they had been 'treated' to sexual encounters with his menage of minors. 
'He took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer, indicating that if he were to answer the question, it 
could be incriminating,' a source told The Mail on Sunday. 
Epstein struck a deal resulting in what commentators characterised as a 'slap on the wrist' for him, and 
ended up serving 13 months of his sentence, much of it in a liberal work-release programme Lawyer Brad 
Edwards, who represented several of Epstein's victims, said: 'Rather than punish him the way they would 
an average Joe, they sent a clear message that with enough money and power and influence, the system 
can be bought.' 
Virginia was spared her the humiliation of having to go before a jury, and has kept her feelings bottled up 
until last weekend's photograph of Andrew with Epstein triggered distressing memories.

English got to do with it? Epstein is American so was the girl. And we all know how morally corrupt the rest of the Maxwell 
family were/are. Prince Andrew is not the epitome of being English. What you are talking about is related to a small minoirty of 
individuals who just happen to be English. If they behave badly, then it says something about them, their chosen lifestyle, or 
the circles they move around in. What it does NOT, is have any bearing on the rest of the nation! So please, let's not get into 
provocative Scottish vs English battle - history is what it is - the PAST. And I certainly won't be accountable for what someone 
else did long before I was born or simply beacause I am also English. I am proud to be English, that is what I am. Now British -

Andrew needs to be investigated and if found guilty of impropriety banished as Persona non Grata. He will lose his right as 
fourth in line to the throne and all the benefits that come with that, including his extravagant and worthless lifestyle being

I was truly disgusted having read this article. Although sadly not surprised, I wonder why people idolize any kind of celebrity or 
other such influential people, most of whom seem to surround themselves with depraved friends & whom can turn a blind 
eye to anything where status, fame & wealth are concerned (seemingly typical of our anything goes society where everything 
is justifiable). That aside, I am more disgusted that out of the 24 comments on this article so far, people are either talking about 
what a pretty piece of tot she is, how she should have basically kept her mouth shut, how we can't be judged by the actions of 
our friends, whether the royal family has any validity (as if it ever had a clean past), & most astonishingly arguments about 
whether Fergie has more right to a royal wedding invite than Andrew! Absolutely disgusting, looking forward to further 
comments on her weight, whether she looks good for her age, & scrutiny over whether she's had any work done soon.

Prostitution Ring Leader Sentenced To 21 Months 
November 11,2001 I Staff report 
A man extradited from Germany has been sentenced to 21 months in prison 
and fined $6,000 for recruiting Czech women to a prostitution ring with 
promises of modeling work. 
Ronald Eppinger had faced up to 10 years after pleading guilty this month to 
charges of alien smuggling for prostitution, interstate travel for prostitution and 
money laundering. 
Eppinger worked with two Czech women to get tourist visas for the future 
prostitutes and kept nearly half of their earnings from operations in Miami, New 
York, Texas and the Bahamas, prosecutors said. Women were brought to the United States illegally from 1997 to 1999.

As part of his plea, Eppinger forfeited a boat and limousine used to promote the call-girl service. 
Eppinger learned he was under investigation in June 1999 and moved from the United States to the Czech capital of Prague. 
He was arrested in Germany last December while traveling from the Czech Republic to Spain and was sent to the United 
States in May.

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra is set to decide in the coming 
days whether the rights of two alleged victims of Palm Beach sex 
offender Jeffrey Epstein were violated when the U.S. Attorney's 
Office failed to confer with them before signing a non-prosecution 
agreement in September 2007. 
Attorneys Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, representing Jane Doe 
No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2, argued Friday in federal court in West 
Palm Beach that the government's action violated the girls' rights 
under the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
Edwards and Cassell want the agreement nullified and want Marra to 
unseal un-redacted plea deal correspondence between the U.S. 
Attorney's Office and Epstein's defense team. If he agrees, that 
action could spur a federal case that might expose Epstein to a 
longer incarceration if convicted. 
After Palm Beach police received a complaint about Epstein in spring 
2005, more than 30 young women participated in civil lawsuits that 
alleged he lured them to his home for sexually charged rubdowns 
and/or sex in exchange for cash when they were minors. Some 
cases were dismissed, and others were settled.

Sides argue whether Jeffrey Epstein's nonprosecution deal violated alleged victims' rights Page 2 of 4 
• • 
Epstein, now 58, pleaded not guilty in August 2006 in state court. 
Eventually he agreed to a state plea deal and served 13 months of 
an 18-month sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and 
soliciting prostitution — but only after his attorneys successfully 
argued for the federal non-prosecution pact. 
The U.S. attorneys sent letters to Jane Doe No. 1 and No. 2 twice in 
2008 describing their case as being under federal investigation — 
even though a non-prosecution agreement had been created the 
previous year and had been kept secret from the young women, 
according to Edwards. Edwards said the latter action eviscerated the 
rights of the two women to bring Epstein to justice. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee told Marra that the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act dictates that victim notification is triggered only after an 
indictment. 
Cassell disagreed. It wasn't designed to be so narrowly 
circumscribed, the Fort Lauderdale lawyer said. 
Lee said requiring federal attorneys to confer with alleged victims 
before they can determine whether an indictment is warranted would 
impinge on prosecutorial discretion. The government believes these 
rights would attach only after a formal indictment, Lee said. 
Marra questioned that assertion. I think we wouldn't be here if your 
office had conferred with the victims, heard them out, and explained 
why prosecution wasn't pursued, the judge said. 
Lee countered that alleged victims have no right to confer with the 
government when the government is not in the case. 
The judge reserved ruling on the plaintiffs' motion to unseal the 
federal attorneys' plea deal correspondence with Epstein's legal 
team. 
He gave famed criminal defense attorney Roy Black two weeks to 
submit materials explaining why the letters should not be turned over 
to the two young women's lawyers. The U.S. Attorney's Office will 
then have two weeks to respond, then the plaintiffs' team will have a 
week to respond. Black will then have a week to deliver his final reply 
to the judge. 
Black had argued that the correspondence was protected by attorney 
-client privilege. Any statements made in regard to plea bargaining 
are immunized whether related to statements of culpability or not, 
Black said. This is classic work product we sent to the government.
