I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FUND OVERVIEW
New Leaf Ventures III, L.P. (“NLV-III” or the “Fund”) is being formed by New Leaf Venture
Partners, L.L.C. (“New Leaf” or the “Management Company”), an established and proven
leader in health care technology investing. NLV-III will be the seventh private equity fund
focused on venture and growth stage investments in healthcare and life sciences companies
raised by the partners of New Leaf. NLV-III is the successor fund to New Leaf Ventures I, L.P.
(“NLV-I”) and New Leaf Ventures II, L.P. (“NLV-II”), which raised capital commitments of
$310 million and $450 million respectively. The New Leaf funds follow four Sprout Capital
funds that included over $1.0 billion of investments in healthcare technology companies. 1 In
total, the New Leaf team has invested over $1.6 billion and have generated one of the industry’s
leading track records by consistently outperforming their peers in the healthcare venture capital
market (based on Cambridge Associates benchmarks 2 ) and exceeding relevant public market
indices by substantial margins. 3,4
The Fund will seek to invest in a diversified portfolio composed of an estimated 24 to 28
healthcare technology companies, most of which will be U.S. based and at the product
development or commercialization phase. Fund investments will typically take the form of
venture capital or growth capital transactions in private companies, or as structured
transactions in small capitalization public companies. The Fund will establish meaningful
ownership positions and in most cases will actively manage the investments with
representation on the boards of directors. The Fund will seek to generate returns that
significantly outperform relevant public market equity indices by creating a portfolio that
optimally balances the risks, timelines, and capital intensity associated with developing and
commercializing innovative healthcare technologies with the financial market realities that are
the backdrop for a venture capital fund focused on this sector.
The Fund is targeting aggregate capital commitments from limited partners of
$375 million.
THE NEW LEAF TEAM
New Leaf is one of the most respected, successful, and established brands in healthcare
technology investing, a reputation built over the last 18 years by a highly experienced and
stable team of partners. NLV-III will be managed by this team of 6 senior partners, 5 of whom
have worked together continuously for a decade or more. These partners bring a strong
combination of significant and relevant industry operating experience and successful venture
capital investment experience to NLV-III.
The Managing Directors of NLV-III are Philippe Chambon MD PhD, Jeani Delagardelle, Ron
Hunt, Vijay Lathi, and Liam Ratcliffe MD PhD. Philippe, Jeani, Ron, and Vijay have worked
together for 15 years over six prior funds at New Leaf and the Sprout Group. Liam joined the

New Leaf team five years ago and has made significant contributions to the NLV-II portfolio.
Jim Niedel MD PhD has worked with the team continuously for over twelve years and will
continue to be a senior member of the NLV investment team for NLV-III, but will change his
status to Venture Partner with the closing of NLV-III. In this role, Jim will work full-time with
NLV during the NLV-III investment period in building and managing the NLV-III portfolio,
and he will continue with full oversight and portfolio management responsibilities for NLV-I
and NLV-II. With 80+ years of venture investing experience and decades of operating
experience in the industries in which they invest, this 6 member senior team (the “Fund
Managers”) brings highly relevant and complementary experience to bear on this Fund. This
team of partners is further strengthened by a group of additional investment professionals who
add highly relevant scientific and life sciences investment experience and have made significant
contributions to the NLV-II portfolio.
The New Leaf team is distinctive in that its members have played a leadership role in the
healthcare venture capital industry over the last two decades. During this time, the Fund
Managers have demonstrated the ability to source high quality investments at all stages,
including start-ups, follow-on private investments, company restructurings, and structured
public investments. The Fund Managers source deals through a range of activities that rely on
their deep relationships in academia, industry, and the investment community (private and
public), resulting in differentiated and, in many cases, proprietary deal flow. Once initial
investments are made, the Fund Managers are focused on building value in technology based
healthcare companies by creating strong management teams and then collaborating with them
to develop, manage, and execute capital efficient business plans. Through these efforts, the
Fund Managers have earned a reputation as value-added investors and have created some of
the best performing portfolios of healthcare technology investments in the industry.
LONG TERM TRACK RECORD
Over an 18 year period and across the portfolios of 6 distinct venture funds focused on
healthcare technology investments, the Fund Managers have delivered net performance that
has consistently outperformed venture industry benchmarks and relevant public equity market
indices 5,6 . The Fund Managers’ track record is notable for the following reasons:
�
Performance has been consistently top-quartile since the mid-1990s:
NLV-I, NLV-II and the healthcare technology portfolios in the Sprout Capital funds
have invested over $1.6 billion in healthcare technology companies since 1995. Over
nearly two decades, returns have consistently exceeded Cambridge Associates’ top-

Exceeded relevant public equity indices by substantial margins on all realized funds:
Members of the New Leaf team invested $1.02 billion in the portfolios of healthcare
technology investments in four Sprout Capital funds (Sprout Capital IX, L.P., Sprout
Capital VIII, L.P., Sprout Capital VII, L.P. and Sprout Growth II, L.P.), and these are now
fully realized (or near fully realized in the case of Sprout Capital IX, L.P.). The net
annual IRR’s on the healthcare technology portfolios in these funds outperformed the
S&P 500 (568 – 2,258 bps), S&P Healthcare (302 – 2,064 bps), NASDAQ Composite (451 –
2,125 bps), and the Russell 3000 (502 – 2,215 bps) using the Public Market Equivalent
Plus (PME+) methodology 8 . Although PME+ methodology is most informative when
used to analyze funds whose returns are mature, the PME+ methodology shows that
NLV-I is outperforming these same indices, and shows encouraging results for NLV-II
despite its relative immaturity.
It is this consistently high level of return over an 18 year period, spanning several challenging
investment cycles, that creates a truly unique track record within the venture capital sector.

OPPORTUNITY IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR
The Fund Managers believe a number of macro market factors have aligned to create attractive
and lasting conditions for NLV-III’s targeted investment strategy in healthcare technology.
These macro market factors include the following:
�
�
�
Strong and Sustained Growth in Global Healthcare Markets: Healthcare is one of the
strongest and most dynamic markets within the global economy, with powerful
demographic forces expected to drive growth at rates that will outpace GDP in major
economies for at least the next decade. 9 This steady and sustained market growth
creates a positive macro environment for investment in the sector.
Significant Opportunity Created By Healthcare Reform & Restructuring: Through at
least the next decade, the healthcare industry will be going through a period of
significant restructuring as government, private insurance companies, and employers
implement broad reform initiatives that seek to slow the growth of healthcare spending
and limit the threat this burden creates to their long term fiscal viability. In the U.S., the
federal government laid the foundation for these changes with two key pieces of
legislation: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) and the Health
Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), which are
designed to reduce costs, improve quality, and significantly expand the percentage of
the population with access to healthcare services. Importantly, a component of the
legislation sets aside funding in the form of direct incentives to healthcare providers to
be used to purchase technologies needed to meet the legislation’s requirements. As part
of healthcare reform, government and private payers will need to migrate their
traditional fee-for-service reimbursement models towards more value-centered
approaches that reward outcomes, efficiency, and reduction in waste. Payers are
approaching this goal by slashing costs in areas where viable lower cost solutions are
available, while at the same time investing much more in the adoption of innovative
new products and solutions which can improve outcomes and deliver quantifiable
value, even when considering their additional costs and premium pricing. During this
period of substantial change in the healthcare system, the Fund Managers expect to see
an unusually large number of opportunities to fund companies developing innovative
and impactful new therapeutic products as well as tools and applications that enable the
implementation and realization of healthcare reform’s goals and objectives.
Rapid Acceleration in Innovation: The Fund Managers believe an unprecedented
period of medical innovation is emerging as decades of research into molecular
mechanisms of disease is being translated into a steady stream of safer and more
effective medicines and the biomarkers to guide their use. Importantly, these products
are providing enormous improvements in both life expectancy and quality of life for
patients with many serious, life-threatening diseases. Although they will come with
premium pricing, these products can decrease the overall costs to the healthcare system
by reducing reliance on equally costly, but less effective and more toxic treatments, by

reducing clinic visits and hospital admissions and by controlling or curing disease so
that the patient can return to a fully productive life. At the same time as this revolution
in the biological sciences is unfolding, exponential increases in the ability to manage,
process, and store information at low cost are coming out of the information technology
(IT) industry. This rapid technological progress in IT is allowing the creation of entirely
new systems and applications that will fundamentally improve how healthcare systems
monitor and manage patients across the full range of care settings. The Fund Managers
believe the massive expansion and integration of capabilities occurring in biology and
information technology is enabling a period of innovation in healthcare that sets a
uniquely positive environment for the investment of NLV-III.
�
�
More Favorable Regulatory Environment For New Drug Approvals: Increasing
numbers of FDA drug approvals and recently passed U.S. regulatory legislation are
reflective of a more favorable regulatory environment. The number of new drug
approvals by FDA in both 2012 (39 NDAs) and 2013 (27 NDAs) trended meaningfully
higher compared to the previous 6 years and versus historic averages 10 . In addition, the
Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) was signed into law on
July 9, 2012, providing for additional tools to enable the FDA to promote innovation by
streamlining parts of the approval process and improving communication and
administrative processes between the agency and pharmaceutical and biotech
companies. Chief among these new tools is the “Breakthrough Therapy” designation.
This new designation helps the FDA assist drug developers to expedite the development
and review of new drugs with preliminary clinical evidence that indicates the drug may
offer a substantial improvement over available therapies for patients with serious or lifethreatening
diseases. Overall, these initiatives and others, both in the U.S. and abroad
(e.g., E.U. and Japan), have made the regulatory environment more favorable for
investors in the biopharmaceutical sector, and have reduced some of the uncertainty and
risk in a critical aspect of drug development.
Capital Markets And Industry Dynamics Are Favorable For New Investments & Exits:
Since the most recent peak in fundraising in 2008, it has been estimated that the life
sciences venture capital fundraising has contracted by 68%, from $7.8 billion in 2008 to
$2.5 billion in 2012 11 . The Fund Managers believe that there has been a corresponding
decline in the number of active venture capital firms investing into life sciences
companies (especially earlier stage), resulting in fewer investors competing for new
deals. At the same time, large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies have
become increasingly dependent on development stage companies as the source of
innovation and new products to supplement R&D pipelines and stimulate future
growth. Most of these big companies are committing a large and growing portion of
their R&D budgets to external facing search and evaluation efforts that have the goal of
obtaining assets through high value mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships, which
disproportionally benefit smaller, venture-backed, development stage companies. In
the years ahead, we believe that this trend is likely to continue, and possibly accelerate,
driven by expected patent expirations on commercial products and continued low
productivity of pharma R&D. The Fund Managers believe these dynamics offer venture

CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL
and growth stage investors attractive conditions for both new investments and exits
from existing investments for the foreseeable future.
The Fund Managers view this alignment of critical market factors as unprecedented. Each of
these factors individually has a direct impact on the level of risk and the potential for returns in
the healthcare technology sector. However, the positive trends in all of them occurring at the
same time should create a uniquely positive environment to execute NLV-III’s targeted strategy
within the sector.
INVESTMENT STRATEGY
New Leaf’s investment strategy is differentiated in the venture capital industry in terms of its
sector focus, specific approaches within each sector, and the depth of experience and long-term
track record that supports each element of the strategy. The Fund’s primary focus will be on
investments in the Biopharmaceutical and Information Convergence sectors, with a secondary
focus on Medical Devices and Biological Research Tools & Infrastructure. Investments will
be predominantly in the U.S., but could include a small number of investments in other parts of
the world (e.g., Western Europe or Canada). The focus within each sector will be the following:
Biopharmaceuticals: As in NLV-I and NLV-II, biopharmaceutical investments will be the core
focus for NLV-III and will comprise approximately 50% - 60% of the Fund. The Fund will
typically invest in development stage and commercial stage private companies and in publicly
traded small capitalization companies where the investments will be made mostly through
structured transactions. The portfolio will emphasize companies developing targeted
therapeutics that address molecular mechanisms of disease, where validated biomarkers can be
utilized to positively bias probabilities of success and reduce time and cost of development
compared to historical averages. These companies exemplify some of the key characteristics the
Fund Managers seek across the portfolio - namely large, unmet medical needs, strong science,
well differentiated technologies and high quality pre-clinical and clinical development
programs led by experienced management teams.
The Fund Managers believe that NLV-III will have the opportunity to invest in compelling
biopharmaceutical opportunities and that these will have attractive risk-return profiles for a
number of reasons, including the following:
�
�
For the past decade, biopharmaceutical companies have been shifting their research and
development focus towards products that target mechanisms of disease at the molecular
level. Clinical programs for these types of products are typically smaller, more capital
efficient and have higher probabilities of success. These improvements are achievable
because precise biomarker testing enables a focus on only those patients where the
specific molecular mechanism is known to play an important role in the disease process.
By including only these patients in the clinical programs for these targeted products, the
probability of detecting critical efficacy signals is significantly increased, even with
relatively small numbers of patients;
Targeted development programs are benefiting from an improving regulatory
environment, as the FDA is demonstrating clear interest in working constructively with
companies to bring these types of high-impact therapeutics to market more quickly and
efficiently. This spirit of cooperation was covered thoughtfully in a recent New England
6
CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL
Journal of Medicine editorial (November 2013), where Janet Woodcock, MD, the FDA’s
Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and other senior FDA staff
members as co-authors, discussed the FDA’s new breakthrough therapy designation
that can be granted to expedite the review and approval of new therapies to treat people
with serious or life threatening illnesses where inadequate treatment options exist. They
state that “The genesis of the new designation can be traced to several emerging trends
in drug discovery and development. Most notable is the rise of molecularly targeted
therapies, often paired with companion diagnostics”. The editorial goes on to say that
“Once a drug is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA commits to working
particularly closely with the drug sponsor to devise the most efficient pathway for
generating additional evidence needed about safety and efficacy”. The breakthrough
therapy designation was created under FDASIA in 2012, and since that time 26
breakthrough therapy designations have been granted on 80 requests; 12
�
�
The pharmaceutical industry’s commercial model is also improving with the shift in
focus to targeted therapeutics, as these therapies can: (a) provide significant
improvements in efficacy and safety over current standards of care; (b) offer important
clinical benefits in terms of increased life expectancy and improved quality of life; (c)
positively impact high morbidity diseases, many of which have primarily expensive, but
inadequate treatments available (e.g., cancer and autoimmune diseases); and (d)
generate compelling economic benefits to payers, even when they carry premium
pricing;
Finally, large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies have recognized the
inefficiency of their internal R&D efforts and have deemphasized many of their own
expensive, high risk, “blockbuster” programs. Increasingly, these companies are
“externalizing” a large portion of their R&D activity by acquiring, licensing, or
partnering with smaller biotech companies that are focused on developing the novel
targeted therapeutics mentioned above.
The Fund Managers believe the net result for investors is an improving risk-return equation for
biopharmaceutical investments, which should translate into higher returns in the sector.
Information Convergence: Information convergence investments will be the second core focus
for NLV-III, expected to comprise up to 25% of the Fund. Building on the leadership
established during the NLV-II investment period along with significant experience from past
Sprout funds, the Fund Managers will invest NLV-III in companies seeking to improve
efficiency and reduce overall costs to the healthcare system through the generation, analysis,
and application of information from research to diagnosis and delivery of care. Investments in
this sector will be at the commercial stage at the time of initial investment, or will be expected to
reach the commercial stage during the projected timeline of the investment.
Central to this opportunity is the acute structural deficit in the U.S., with healthcare liabilities
the single largest contributor and the healthcare reform initiatives that were designed in part to
address these critical fiscal issues. Broad scale deployment of new information technology will

Therapy” Designation

CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL
play a critical role in enabling the necessary structural changes to the healthcare system. The
HITECH Act created a $25.9 billion 13 Federal Government funded catalyst for the adoption of
information technology in healthcare in the U.S., and this is stimulating significant investment
in upgrading the information infrastructure at the provider level. This industry-wide
technology upgrade moves the vast majority of providers onto electronic systems, which offers
immediate efficiencies to their businesses and lays the foundation for the adoption of new
targeted information based applications in the future. These investments and legislative actions
by the U.S. government, and the subsequent response by insurers, providers and patients, are
driving a dramatic increase in spending on healthcare information technology (HIT), benefitting
the companies providing technology solutions that reduce cost and waste, drive efficiency, and
improve the quality of patient care.
The opportunity in information convergence also benefits significantly from the technologies
and infrastructure that have been developed and implemented outside of healthcare, such as
cloud computing, wireless communications, web-delivered software-as-a-service, and sensor
technology. Small companies drawing heavily off these existing technologies are able to
optimize their product through rapid iterations driven by user feedback, thereby reducing risk
and capital requirements, and leading to more predictable timelines, similar to what has been
seen in the broader information technology arena. The Fund Managers believe that smaller,
focused companies will play a key role in developing and deploying information based
products that address discrete problems within the U.S. healthcare market, and that a large
number of these will be compelling investment opportunities for NLV-III.
Medical Devices: Given the Fund Managers’ view that the operating and exit environment for
companies in this sector will be more challenging due to increased regulatory and
reimbursement uncertainty, NLV-III will have somewhat less exposure to this sector than
previous funds. The Fund will focus on investments in companies that are developing
innovative and differentiated medical devices, targeting large market opportunities that offer
the potential to meaningfully reduce overall patient treatment costs in high morbidity disease
settings through substantial efficacy and safety benefits versus existing standards of care.
Importantly, the focus will be on opportunities that have established regulatory approval
pathways and clear regulatory precedents, or are already at the commercial stage at the time of
initial investment. The objective will be to identify investment opportunities with later stage
risk profiles that can be expected to thrive in the current environment. Although the number of
deals in this sector is likely to be somewhat lower than in previous funds, with the later stage
focus, it is likely that the size of investments in this sector will be larger.
Biological Research Tools & Infrastructure: The rapid growth of this sector is being fuelled by
many of the same biomedical advances that are impacting health care more broadly, such as
personalized medicine and DNA sequencing. Smaller companies have always been a prolific
source of innovative new research tools, leading to high M&A interest among the large
commercial players in this sector. Moreover, because new reagents and research tools are not
subject to the risks of clinical trials, regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement it is possible
to build high-gross margins businesses that reach break-even on manageable timelines and
budgets. The Fund will approach this sector opportunistically and will seek to invest in a small

DEAL FLOW AND INVESTMENT PROCESS
The Fund Managers have a proactive approach to deal sourcing, which targets both private and
public opportunities. The established and proven sourcing activities rely on diverse networks
of deal sources that have been built and cultivated over two decades and focus on identifying
compelling healthcare technology investment opportunities, at attractive time points for
investment. These efforts balance the inherent attractiveness of an innovative technology with
the selection of the appropriate investment stage, offering an optimal risk-adjusted return
potential and multiple paths to realization and liquidity.
The Fund Managers have refined and successfully executed this investment process over many
years, and it is an integral part of the firm’s culture. New Leaf’s investment philosophy and
process emphasize a team approach to maximizing investment returns, focusing the most
appropriate resources within the firm to deal sourcing, rigorous investment analysis, deep
involvement with portfolio companies and active management of financings and exits.
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF NEW LEAF

INDUSTRY ADVISORS
The Fund Managers work closely with industry professionals who are experts in New Leaf’s
fields of interest and are willing to work closely with the Fund Managers on an as needed basis
to provide their perspectives on topics and issues that are relevant to due diligence on new
investments, on-going issues that arise in the management of existing portfolio companies, and
longer term fund strategy. New Leaf’s advisors are all prominent in their fields, and hold
senior positions within leading corporations and academic institutions. These experts provide
New Leaf and its portfolio companies with their own invaluable insights, but equally
importantly open up their networks of contacts in ways that vastly expand and strengthen New
Leaf’s own network.
Therapeutics Advisors
New Leaf works with a broad range of industry advisors to support its investment activities in
therapeutics. The Fund Managers work on an as needed basis with a large group of advisors
that includes contacts from industry and academia that each of the investment professionals
within the firm has cultivated through their own professional and academic experiences. The
Fund Managers solicit input from advisors on an as needed basis to get valuable input on
specific scientific, clinical, and commercial issues and topics relevant to diligence on new
investment opportunities, and to the management of existing portfolio companies. This
network gives New Leaf timely and valuable access to some of the world’s leading academic
scientists and experienced practitioners/executives from industry, and brings their subject
matter expertise to bear across the myriad of topics that are critical to New Leaf’s decision
making in the therapeutics sectors. Because of the breadth of topics where this type of outside
input is required, and due to the fact that the science and technology is evolving rapidly in most
of these fields, New Leaf has not created a formal advisory board for therapeutics
Information Convergence Advisory Board
The Fund Managers have assembled an additional advisory board to support activities in
Information Convergence. This group of advisors has a breadth of experience in the
development and deployment of new information technologies that are reshaping healthcare.

III. SUMMARY OF HISTORICAL INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE
The Fund Managers’ long term track record in healthcare technology investing clearly
establishes the team as one of the most successful in the venture capital industry over the last
two decades. Over an 18 year period and across the portfolios of six distinct venture funds
focused on healthcare technology investments, the Fund Managers have delivered net
performance that has consistently outperformed venture industry benchmarks and relevant
public equity market indices 15,16 . The Fund Managers’ track record is notable for the following
reasons:
� Performance has been consistently top-quartile since the mid-1990s:
NLV-I, NLV-II and the healthcare technology portfolios in the Sprout Capital funds
have invested over $1.6 billion in healthcare technology companies since 1995. Over this
time, The Fund Managers’ returns have consistently exceeded Cambridge Associates’
top-quartile benchmarks for U.S. venture capital healthcare and/or U.S. total venture
capital. 16
�
Exceeded relevant public equity indices by substantial margins on all realized funds:
The Fund Managers invested $1.02 billion in the portfolios of healthcare technology
investments in four Sprout Capital funds (Sprout Capital IX, L.P., Sprout Capital VIII,
L.P., Sprout Capital VII, L.P. and Sprout Growth II, L.P.), and these are now fully
realized (or near fully realized in the case of Sprout Capital IX). The net annual IRR’s on
these four funds outperformed the S&P 500 (568 – 2,259 bps), S&P Healthcare (302 –
2,066 bps), NASDAQ Composite (451 – 2,125 bps), and the Russell 3000 (502 – 2,215 bps)
using the Public Market Equivalent Plus (PME+) methodology 17 . Although PME+
methodology is most informative when used to analyze funds whose returns are
mature, the PME+ methodology shows that NLV-I is outperforming these same indices,
and shows encouraging results for NLV-II despite its relative immaturity.
It is this consistently high level of return over an 18 year period, spanning several challenging
investment cycles, that creates a truly unique track record within the venture capital sector.
INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE WITHIN INDIVIDUAL FUNDS
The New Leaf team has invested over $1.67 billion in 126 healthcare technology companies
within 6 distinct funds since 1995. These funds included NLV-I and NLV-II and the healthcare
technology investments in four Sprout Capital funds (Sprout Capital IX, L.P., Sprout Capital
VIII, L.P., Sprout Capital VII, L.P., and Sprout Growth II, L.P., together the “Sprout Funds”). In
aggregate, the team has exited or partially exited investments in 92 companies, generating gross
realizations of over $2.6 billion and a gross realized cash-on-cash return and internal rate of
return (IRR) of 2.1x and 17%, respectively. Corresponding net returns on the portfolios in each
of these funds are provided in Appendix 2.

New Leaf Funds
NLV-I has capital commitments of $310 million, and the Fund Managers began investing in
mid-2005. The fund completed its new investment period in early 2008 with a portfolio of 22
companies. NLV-I has fully realized 13 investments, and there are nine active investments in
companies and contingent value rights (CVRs) from three of the realized investments remaining
in the fund. NLV-I is a relatively young fund, with the majority of the cost basis still at work,
and to date has generated a gross realized IRR of 23%, and a gross total IRR of 19%. NLV-I has
a net total multiple of 1.76x and a net IRR of 12.1%. NLV-I has a distributed to paid-in-capital
ratio of 0.51x, and the Fund Managers believe the fund has significant future returns potential
from the remaining active investments in the portfolio as well as from potential payments from
CVRs on three realized investments. NLV-I is in the top quartile of funds tracked by
Cambridge Associates for U.S. healthcare venture capital in the 2005 vintage year.
NLV-II has capital commitments of $450 million, and the Fund Managers began investing in
2008. The fund will complete its new investment period by mid-2014. NLV-II currently has a
portfolio consisting of 35 companies. NLV-II has realized or partially realized 13 investments,
and there are 22 other active investments and a small public portfolio remaining in the fund.
NLV-II is still an immature fund in terms of level of realizations, and to date has generated a
gross realized IRR of 34%, and a gross total IRR of 30%. NLV-II has a net total multiple of 1.44x
and a net IRR of 16.4%. NLV-II has a distributed to paid-in-capital ratio of 0.50x, and the Fund
Managers believe the fund has significant future returns potential from the remaining active
investments in the portfolio. The Fund Managers believe that NLV-II has unusually positive
liquidity characteristics for a life sciences focused venture capital fund of its age, with just over
65% of the fund’s current carrying value in the form of public securities (as of March 31, 2014).
NLV-II’s current performance places the fund in the top quartile of funds tracked by Cambridge
Associates for U.S. venture capital in the 2008 vintage year.
Additionally, over the investment period of NLV-I, the net annual IRR is outperforming
relevant public market indices when compared on a public market equivalent basis (PME+).
NLV-II’s net annual IRR shows encouraging results thus far for a relatively immature fund 18 .
The range of outperformance for each of these portfolios versus the S&P 500, S&P Healthcare,
NASDAQ Composite, and the Russell 3000 through March 31, 2014 is the following:

Sprout Capital Healthcare Technology Portfolios:
Since 1995, members of the New Leaf team made all of the healthcare technology investments in
the Sprout Funds while they were part of the investing team at the Sprout Group. The Sprout
Funds were venture capital funds that were diversified across several sectors including
information technology, communications, services, and healthcare technology. The healthcare
technology investments in the four Sprout Funds included $1.019 billion in total cost, which
was invested in new and follow-on investments in 69 companies from 1995 to 2013. The
healthcare technology investments in the first three of these funds are now fully realized, and
those in Sprout IX are nearly fully realized. To date, across these four funds, the New Leaf team
has generated $1.997 billion of realizations in the aggregate (63 realized investments), and there
is $68 million in unrealized value in six unrealized investments.
The net annual IRR performance on the healthcare technology portfolios in each of the Sprout
Funds would place them in the top quartile of all healthcare venture capital funds tracked by
Cambridge Associates in each of the vintage years for which they have established a
benchmark 19 . Additionally, over an 18 year period the net annual IRR on these portfolios
outperformed relevant public market indices when compared on a public market equivalent
basis (PME+) 20 . The range of outperformance for each of these portfolios versus the S&P 500,

IV. OPPORTUNITY IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR
The Fund Managers believe a number of macro market factors have aligned to create attractive
and lasting conditions for NLV-III’s targeted investment strategy in healthcare technology.
Each of these market factors individually would have a direct positive impact on the level of
risk and the potential for returns from investments in the healthcare technology sector. The fact
that there are positive trends in all of them occurring simultaneously is unprecedented, and the
Fund Managers expect that this will create a uniquely positive environment for NLV-III’s
investments in the healthcare technology sector. These macro market factors include the
following:
STRONG GROWTH IN GLOBAL HEALTHCARE MARKETS
Healthcare is one of the largest and most dynamic segments of the global economy, and its
growth is projected to continue the well-established historical trend of outpacing GDP growth
in major economies for at least the next decade. 21 In the U.S., since 1970, health care spending
per capita has grown at an average annual rate of 8.2% or 2.4 percentage points faster than
nominal GDP. The persistence of this trend suggests systematic differences between health care
and other economic sectors where growth rates are typically more in line with the overall
economy. A smaller difference is projected over the 2011 to 2020 period, where the average
annual growth in per capita health spending (5.3%) is projected to be about 140 basis points
higher than the growth in GDP (3.9%) 22 . This powerful and sustained growth differentiates
healthcare from many other large industrial and technology sectors, and it creates a positive
backdrop for investment in certain areas within the sector.
The drivers of healthcare market growth vary between mature and emerging economies, but in
both cases the shifts are resulting in significant increases in per capita health care consumption
and predictable increases in spending to meet the rising demand. In developed economies,
growth is being driven primarily by an aging population coupled with a continued willingness
of payers to cover the costs for new therapeutics and interventions that meaningfully extend or
improve the quality of patients’ lives. In the U.S., which is representative of the demographic
shifts in other major economies, the number of people over 65 is expected to double over the
next three decades, reaching 70 million by 2030 or roughly 20% of the total U.S. population. 23
This aging demographic has a higher prevalence of disease and the cost of delivering care to
treat the diseases of this older demographic is rising steadily. For example, in 2009, the per
capita health care cost for a person 65 – 74 years old was approximately $14,000, but it was more
than double that ($33,000) for those over 85. Before the end of this decade, the projected per
capita annual cost to care for these same two groups is expected to rise to $22,000 (+57%) for 65
– 74 year olds and $55,000 (+67%) for those 85+ 24 .
Emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs) are also contributing to the
growth in health care spending globally, as these emerging markets mature and begin moving
towards the standards of their counterparts in developed economies. The size of the middle

and upper classes in these countries is growing rapidly, and the spending power of these
groups is becoming important to the global economy in many sectors. As the populations of
these countries become more affluent, a greater proportion of their GDP is being spent on health
care, and this is leading to rapid growth in many different healthcare product sectors in these
countries. For example, China’s prescription drug market, which is projected to be the world’s
second largest by 2020, is projected to grow to more than $110 billion by 2015 – up from $50
billion in 2010. 25 The medical device market in China is showing a similar growth pattern, with
the current $17 billion medtech market (world’s fourth largest) projected to more than double
within the next five years. 26 This growth in emerging economies is expected to continue for the
foreseeable future, and as it does, it will open vast new markets for established healthcare
products companies in more developed countries, and will become increasingly important as a
percentage of sales of global brands. At the same time, it will create opportunities for smaller,
U.S. based companies to partner with large multinationals and domestic companies in the
BRICs that have established distribution channels in these markets.
SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY CREATED BY HEALTHCARE REFORM &
RESTRUCTURING
As a result of the strong growth in healthcare expenditures, for at least the next decade, and
likely much longer, the healthcare industry in the U.S. will be going through a period of
significant reform and restructuring as the increasing healthcare costs place unsustainable fiscal
burdens on government programs. After years of dire predictions and endless debate amongst
elected officials, pundits, corporate leaders, and patient advocacy groups, there is recognition
that long term healthcare liabilities are a critical issue and require broad reform to control their
growth before they lead to irreparable fiscal harm. While much of the attention in these
initiatives is focused on identifying opportunities to cut costs, the silver lining in them for
investors is that their objectives also seek to improve the quality of healthcare and to
substantially broaden the population that has access to healthcare services covered by third
party payment.
In the U.S., the Federal Government has laid the foundations for restructuring the healthcare
system through two key pieces of legislation. First, the HITECH Act provides large government
subsidies for the adoption of IT tools by healthcare providers. The Federal Government has
recognized that a fundamental underpinning of healthcare reform is a massive upgrade of the
information technology infrastructure at all levels of the industry, and through this legislation
has earmarked $26 billion dollars in direct subsidies to catalyze investment in this area.
The second key piece of legislation is the ACA, which is being implemented as a first step in the
overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system. The ACA was signed into law in the U.S. in 2010 and
begins its implementation phase in 2014. It is a complex piece of legislation that is designed to
