Real Estate License Fees (Royalties) are customarily paid to Trump in phases: upon signing of the License Agreement (Upfront Fee), and during various
stages of the project’s development. Therefore, the amount of License fee income reflected herein is dependent on the phase of that project’s development
cycle with the majority of payment back-loaded towards project completion.
