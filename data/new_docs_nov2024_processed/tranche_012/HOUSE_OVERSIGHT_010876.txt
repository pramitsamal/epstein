Q. Okay. You felt that it furthered her legal
interests to specify American politicians, powerful
business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known
prime minister and other world leaders; that was your --
you -- you believe that furthered her legal interest?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you also anticipate that that would
titilate the Press, so to speak, that there would be a
lot of speculation on who these people are?

A. That wasn't the -- that wasn't the focus
of the -~ those comments, no.

Q. You said it wasn't the focus. Did you
realize it would happen?

A. Sure. I mean, this was a case that had
been already ~~ this litigation had been going on at
that point for seven years and lots of people were
following it. This is -~ this case is one of the most
egregious examples of a violation of Crime Victims'
Rights in the history of this country.

And so against that context, yes, there were
going to be people interested in every word that was
going into this pleading. Whether we had gone more
broadly or more narrowly than what we did, people were
going to be interested in this.

Q. And as of December 30th of 2014, Miss Roberts
ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400
293
had the same ability to disclose who these individuals
were publicly, as did Jeffrey Epstein, correct, because
she had personal knowledge of who they were?

A. She had the ability to speak the words, but,
again, I think it's preposterous to say that a victim of
sex trafficking has the same power as the sex trafficker
to disclose information.

For example, Virginia Roberts could be
attacked, and I think as we were talking about
yesterday, we have seen evidence of the kind of attack
that powerful people can mount against the victims of
sex trafficking. So to say that the young women in sex
trafficking schemes have the same power as their
traffickers to do this ~~ I'm sorry. I'm going to have
to take a break.

break. I appreciate that.
Q. Okay.
MR. SCAROLA: Could you just read back the
last question for me? I just want to orient
myself as to where we are. Thank you.
(Thereupon, a portion of the record was read
by the reporter.)
MR. SCAROLA: Yeah, I didn't I think the
answer was -~
THE WITNESS: I guess | was mid-sentence, so
think I will just stick with the same word,
preposterous. And one -- one thing that occurred
to me during the break, in the context of this
case, is that there had been allegations that
Epstein was part of the -- the sex trafficking
organization, had video cameras mounted
throughout many of his -- his mansions. And so,
whereas a young woman could say, or a young girl
could say, look, I was a victim of sex abuse,
people would attack her; people wouldn't believe
her, that unless she had, you know, corroborating
evidence, people would say, well, look, it didn't
happen.
And so Epstein had managed to collect
apparently a lot of videotapes and other kinds of
ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS

information that would have been -- given him the
ability to make the blackmail kinds of charges
that the girls that he was trafficking would --
would not have had the ability to do.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Mr. Cassell, didn't you testify yesterday
that any videotapes from Mr. Epstein’s house had been
destroyed?

A. I-- when I used the word “destroyed,” I
probably should have been more precise. They had been
concealed from law enforcement, is what I meant. That
when Palm Beach Police Department went up to the Epstein
mansion, they found surveillance cameras and other
cameras. I can't remember exactly where the cameras
were, but they found surveillance cameras, and when they
looked for the tapes associated with those cameras, I
used the word destroyed; and as I say, I probably
should have said they were missing. And so they were
never able to locate those -~- those missing videotapes.

Q. Soas of December 30th of 2014, to your
knowledge, there were no videotapes available?

A. There were no videotapes available to law
enforcement or to Brad and his pro bono crime victim
attorneys to help document our case. We were trying to
get those and we are continuing to try to get those,
