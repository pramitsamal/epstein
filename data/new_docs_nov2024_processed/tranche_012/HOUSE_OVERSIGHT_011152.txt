into physical capital holdings. That can be notated z, . I don’t allow transfer from
physical to human capital in adults, which would mean invested consumption C,
afforded from property cash flow, because I see so little adult C, (adult education)
on which to spend it. That’s why I model 7, aS Zero. Meanwhile realized
decapitalizaiton is decomposed into its human and physical components D(H), and

D(K), . This adapts (A4.4) to

K,=H+K=W.+P. + p({K),,+2,-D(H),-D(K),, ifage >=A, (A10.6)

and specifically

H=W,-D(H), and K=z,+P+p(K),—D(K),, ifage >=A.

Next Generation Theory

The period of production, as defined by Jevons and Boehm Bawerk, gave the
reciprocal of rate of production (rate of return Y/K,, ) if growth were zero. Output Y

equals growth plus cash flow. Then Jevons and Boehm Bawerk really meant the

period needed for output to make up for losses to cash flow. I call this the “cash flow

period” T, , equal to the reciprocal of cash flow rate f. That is,

(A11.1)

Both modeled at the collective scale, where cash flow under the Y=I+C equation
both would have accepted simplifies to consumption C. Adjustment to the Y rule

corrects this to pure consumption C, . That would specify (A11.1) as
