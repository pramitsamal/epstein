and 19th century Utah [6].

3 Uncertainty about recipients

Thus far, I have assumed that the recipient is known with certainty at the time the investment
is made. No allowance has yet been made for the possibility that the benefit may eventually go
to someone other than the intended recipient. As in my previous paper on time preference, I
will incorporate uncertainty by assuming that when the benefit arrives, it will be allocated among
potential recipients (including the donor herself) so as to maximize its discounted value to the
donor. As before, I rule out the possibility of distributing the benefit among several recipients.
The development below differs from that of my previous paper in two ways. First, it allows the
interaction to affect fertility as well as survival. Second, it will incorporate diminishing marginal
returns to consumption.

3.1 Model

We begin as before, with table 1. The difference is that, under uncertainty it is not the row-sum
itself that must equal zero, but the expected value of this sum. I assume changes in fertility and
survival are caused by changes in consumption, as discussed above in section 2.2.2. In addition, I
use the model of diminishing marginal returns defined above in section 2.3. Thus, equations 6-7
and 11-12 allow equation 5 to be re-expressed as

0= An (am + BPYY) [KO
+ Ane? Bf (am) + BPA) /n (14)

where £ denotes the expectation. In taking this expectation, I define v@) = 0 when there is no
recipient at all.
