or was not privileged. We don't take jury evidence on that,
you know, Judge Marra's ruling, and therefore, that should be
excluded. So that is item number 19.

Let me turn then to item 20, and I'm handling that.

This is essentially a hearsay exercise. We want information to

b xcluded regarding Rebecca Boylan. Why? Because Rebecca

Boylan has not been deposed and is not going to be a witness in
the case.

As we understand what the defendant is planning to do,
she's planning to call Mr. Dershowitz. Mr. Dershowitz is going

to say Ms. Boylan told him that Ms. Giuffre told him something,

and so we have the classic hearsay within a hearsay situation.

The problem, of course, is that Boylan is not here.

The defendant's pleadings say, ah-hah, but this is an

admission by Ms. Giuffre, and it would be if Ms. Boylan were on
the stand so we could ask her questions about, well, did

Ms. Giuffre really say that? And what did she mean? And

wasn't she saying that she's been abused by Ms. Maxwell? But

they want to skip over that intermediate stuff, have Dershowitz

describe what Boylan describes Ms. Giuffre said, and that's

obviously -- and then I'm assuming Dershowitz is going to put

his spin on what Ms. Boylan allegedly said to him. There are

no set of circumstances in which that hearsay within hearsay

could be admissible because Ms. Boylan has not been deposed,

and is not here, it's rank multiple hearsay.
