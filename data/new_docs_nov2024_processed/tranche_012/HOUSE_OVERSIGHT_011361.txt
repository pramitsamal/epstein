there's the lie about the tip jar theft, and then there is the

arrest warrant that was issued that plaintiff left the country

for over a decade while that arrest warrant was outstanding.

Your Honor, the fact of police contacts during this

timeframe, including this one, go directly to other issues,

including whether or not plaintiff was truly the sex slave that

she describes. She had an opportunity, because she called th

police on numbers of occasions during the relevant time

period she called them to report a theft, she called them to

help with a civil assist getting her out of her apartment, she

called them for all kinds of reasons -- and at none of those
points of time did she tell the police that she was currently
then a, quote/unquote, sex slave.

Your Honor, the Roadhouse Grill also -—- the Mail On
Sunday is the one who printed a story about the Roadhouse Grill
and confronted her aunt who was being interviewed for one of
their stories about it. The aunt was in the process of saying

what a great niece she had, and then the news asked her about

the Roadhouse Grill theft, and she said, Wow, I didn't even

know that she was working in a burger joint. So it goes to

her internet reputation.
And finally, your Honor, I think if you look back to

that email between our client and Mr. Dershowitz on page GMOO09,

it's one of the lies that our client specifically referred to.

She quotes Virginia Giuffre's statement, Jeffrey bought me
