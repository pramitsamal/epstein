our witness list is AH, who is in the report and she testified
in this case.

THE COURT: Well, that's a different issue. And you

said you're going to present her.

MS. McCAWLEY: Yes.

THE COURT: Well, all right. That's a different

question. But in other words, you could show her the report
and ask her if she's aware of these reports. I assume what her
answer is going to be. And that's the end of it.

MS. McCAWLEY: Well, your Honor, I mean, obviously

we'd like to enter the reports under the business record

exception through Recarey and through the residual hearsay --

THE COURT: But even if you do that, I don't see how

you avoid eliminating the hearsay.
Well, okay. All right.
MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, could I have one final

comment on this. If they're not being offered for the truth of

the matter asserted, they're really not relevant to this case

is my final point, because if they're not being offered for the

truth of the matter asserted, at best it's a neutral as to

whether these things did or didn't happen. If they didn't

happen, they would certainly be supportive of Ms. Maxwell's

state of mind if she knew about them. If they're not being

offered for the truth of the matter --

=

THE COURT: Well, it might be material that she knew
