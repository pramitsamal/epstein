This was before the baby. And I asked him -- I asked him

for like 300. I don't I couldn't

tell you how I got it

was he there when you went to get the money?
No.

Do you know was he in town or did you call him?

fp PF Pp

I don't even -

Q. Was that the only time that he gave you money

that wasn't connected either to a massage or to bringing
a girl?

A. He bought gifts for the baby shower. TI can't
remember now. Not off the top of my head, no. I never
asked him for anything because I just felt -- I'm not
like that, you know. I'm not a user and I'm not -- I
don't like that. I've never asked him for money, so --

Q. What about presents, either birthday presents?
You mentioned gifts for the baby. Any other gifts that
he gave you?

A. Yeah, he gave me a -- he had went to Brazil and
he came back with a whole bunch of bikinis and he told me
to choose one, so I chose one.

Q. Any other gifts, Christmastime or birthdays or

anything like that?
