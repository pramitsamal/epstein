properties could be manifested by AI systems. Rigorously studying the corpus of existing (or
hypothetical!) cognitive architectures using these ideas would be a large task, which we do not
undertake here.

In the next sections we review several hybrid architectures in more detail, focusing most
deeply on LIDA and MicroPsi which have been directly inspirational for CogPrime.

4.5.1 CLARION

Ron Sun’s CLARION architecture (see Figure 4.9) is interesting in its combination of symbolic
and neural aspects — a combination that is used in a sophisticated way to embody the distinction
and interaction between implicit and explicit mental processes. From a CLARION perspective,
architectures like Soar and ACT-R are severely limited in that they deal only with explicit
knowledge and associated learning processes.

CLARION consists of a number of distinct subsystems, each of which contains a dual rep-
resentational structure, including a “rules and chunks” symbolic knowledge store somewhat
similar to ACT-R, and a neural net knowledge store embodying implicit knowledge. The main
subsystems are:

e An action-centered subsystem to control actions;

e A non-action-centered subsystem to maintain general knowledge;

e A motivational subsystem to provide underlying motivations for perception, action, and
cognition;

e A meta-cognitive subsystem to monitor, direct, and modify the operations of all the other
subsystems.
