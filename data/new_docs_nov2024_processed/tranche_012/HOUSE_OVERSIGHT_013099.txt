10.6 Conclusion 183

Correspondence Principle tells us something about what this tuning should involve — namely,
making a system possessing mind-state sequences that correspond meaningfully to world-state
sequences. CogPrime’s overall design and particular cognitive processes are reasonably well
interpreted as an attempt to achieve this for everyday human goals and environments.

One way of extending these theoretical ideas into a more rigorous theory is explored in Ap-
pendix ??. The key ideas involved there are: modeling multiple memory types as mathematical
categories (with functors mapping between them), modeling memory items as probability dis-
tributions, and measuring distance between memory items using two metrics, one based on
algorithmic information theory and one on classical information geometry. Building on these
ideas, core hypotheses are then presented:

® asyntax-semantics correlation principle, stating that in a successful AGI system, these
two metrics should be roughly correlated

e a cognitive geometrodynamics principle, stating that on the whole intelligent minds
tend to follow geodesics (shortest paths) in mindspace, according to various appropriately
defined metrics (e.g. the metric measuring the distance between two entities in terms of the
length and/or runtime of the shortest programs computing one from the other).

® acognitive synergy principle, stating that shorter paths may be found through the com-
posite mindspace formed by considering multiple memory types together, than by following
the geodesics in the mindspaces corresponding to individual memory types.

The material is relegated to an appendix because it is so speculative, and it’s not yet clear
whether it will really be useful in advancing or interpreting CogPrime or other AGI systems
(unlike the material from the present chapter, which has at least been useful in interpreting
and tweaking the CogPrime design, even though it can’t be claimed that CogPrime was derived
directly from these theoretical ideas). However, this sort of speculative exploration is, in our
view, exactly the sort of thing that’s needed as a first phase in transitioning the ideas of the
present chapter into a more powerful and directly actionable theory.
