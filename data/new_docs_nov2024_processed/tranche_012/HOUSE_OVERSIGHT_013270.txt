Clients always want
their aircraft to be

modern and up-to-date,

while maintaining an
understated, luxurious
aesthetic

n a 50,000-square-foot hangar at Long Island’s MacArthur Airport, an aircraft interiors
project has its designer “fired on all cylinders”. Tasked to modify and refurbish a

Global 5000 for the sports entertainment giant, World Wrestling Entertaiment (WWE,
formerly WWF), New York-based International Jet Interiors is putting a progressive spin
on cabin design. While the livery boasts WWE’s corporate colours, the interiors use
“hand-woven carpets, custom-made metal finishes including a spun black pearl finish,
custom-dyed leathers and bespoke seating from Italy”, says Eric Roth, the designer at
International Jet Interiors’ helm.

But the highlight is in the high-tech facilities: studio-grade equipment that enables on-the-
fly editing of feeds from live sports entertamment shows, which are transmitted via on-board
satellite. Meanwhile, specially programmed iPad minis control the cabin functions. “It will be
the ultimate couture craft when completed in January 2014,” says Roth.

No stranger to special client requests, Roth says he loves the challenge — the more unusual
the request, the more he and his team seem to excel in delivering the solution. His clients
come from around the world with a varied wish-list, ranging from entertamment systems with

satellite TV and high-speed WiFi to 24-karat gold-plated fixtures throughout the craft. >>
