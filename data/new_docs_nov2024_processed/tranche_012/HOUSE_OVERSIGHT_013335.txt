County, Florida, defendant Epstein, entered pleas of guilty to various Florida state crimes
énvblying the solicitation of minors for prostitution and the procurement of minors for the
purposes of prostitution. See Plea Colloquy (Exhibit “R”).

prokeanfing the Defendant, Epstein additionally entered into an agreement with the Federal
Government acknowledging that approximately thirty-four (34) other young girls could receive
payments from him under the federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child
sexual abuse, 18 U.S.C. § 2255. As had been agreed months before, the U.S. Attorney’s Office
didnot prosecute Epstein federally for his sexual abuse of these minor girls. See Addendum to
