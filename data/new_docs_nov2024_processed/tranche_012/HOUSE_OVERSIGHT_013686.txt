Biological Scientists Can Understand and Use Ideas and Methods of
Nonlinear Science

A yield of advances in computer hardware and software is that even quite
difficult applied nonlinear mathematics can become accessible to experimentally
oriented biological scientists. Before this time, the development and analysis of a
particular set of nonlinear differential equations, describing the actions of a
neurobiological system in motion, involved decades of specialty training, rare insight
and many hours of highly skilled, trial and error computations by hand. Since the
idiosyncrasies of each nonlinear system were considered unique, the results of their
analyses were thought to concern only the particular nonlinear system being
studied. Often a shift in hypothetical mechanism meant starting the long and painful
process all over again. In addition, these findings were usually communicated only
to a small and arcane mathematical community in the form of dense theorems and
difficult to follow proofs, insurmountable language barriers to biological researchers
wishing to use them to better describe and understand their experimental
observations.

For today’s neuroscientist with a desktop computer, an inclination to program
and access to computer algebra and numerical software such as Maple,
Mathematica or MatLab, operational definitions and computational empiricism can
replace the theorem and proof continuity required to do old style applied
mathematics. For those of us without sufficient facility in algebraic manipulation to
easily follow the arguments of professional mathematicians, a computer algebra
program such as Maple serves as a delightfully accessible consultant with which to
“check out what the guy is saying. Those motivated enough to write their own data
