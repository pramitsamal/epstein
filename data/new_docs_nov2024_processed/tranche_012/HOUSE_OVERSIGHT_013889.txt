THE BEST TIMES TO SEND E-MAIL

You’ve suggested people check e-mail only a few times a day. Here’s a twist: I reply to e-mails
when it’s convenient, but I time it to arrive when it’s also convenient for me. In Outlook you can
delay e-mail delivery to any time of day. For example, when I return e-mails at 3 p.m., I don’t want
my staff instantly zinging me responses or clarifying questions. (This also prevents e-mail chats.) So I
hit send, but it’s delayed to arrive later in the evening or at 8 A.M. when my employees arrive the
next day. This is how e-mail was meant to be! It’s mail, not a chat service.

. No one can argue with your feelings, so use this to avoid a debate about external circumstances.

18. Notice how I take “you” out of the sentence to avoid finger-pointing, even though it’s implicit.
“Normally, you make priorities clear” sounds like a backhanded insult. If this is a significant other,
you can skip this formality, but never use “you always do X,” which is just a fight starter.

19. Take a little bit of the heat off with this. The point has already been made.

20. “Before I forget” is a great segue to the closing compliment, which is also a topic shifter and gets
you off the sensitive topic without awkwardness.
