You: Hi, Mr. Grisham. My name is Tim Ferriss. I know this might sound a bit odd, but I’m a first-time
author and a longtime fan. I just read your interview in Time Out New York and finally built up the
courage to call. I have wanted to ask you for a specific piece of advice for a long time, and it shouldn’t

take more than two minutes of your time. May I?22
John Grisham: Uh ... OK. Go ahead. I have to be on a call in a few minutes.

You (at the very end of the call): Thank you so much for being so generous with your time. If I have the
occasional tough question—very occasional—is there any chance I could keep in touch via e-mail?28

OVER THE MOON

My 13-year-old daughter would like to be an astronaut when she grows up. Last year she had an
extreme challenge to deal with. The phrase from Apollo 13 “Failure is not an option” sort of became our
motto. I got the idea of contacting the commander of Apollo 13, Jim Lovell. It didn’t take much to find
him and he sent her a wonderful letter about his ordeal just to get into the Apollo program, not to
mention dealing with a crippled spacecraft. His letter made a big difference to my daughter. A couple
months later, we were able to take things a little further by getting her VIP access to a shuttle launch.
