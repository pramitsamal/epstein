Inexpensive but Dependable Hosting Services

Shared hosting solutions, where your site is hosted alongside other sites on a single server, are so cheap
that I recommend using two providers, one as a primary and one as a backup. Put your site pages on
each host and sign up with www.no-ip.com, which can redirect traffic (DNS) to the backup in five
minutes instead of the usual 24 to 48 hours.
