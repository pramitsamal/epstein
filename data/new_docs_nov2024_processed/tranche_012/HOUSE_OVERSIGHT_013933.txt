Call Centers (per-minute and/or per-sale fees)
There are generally two classes of call centers: order takers and commissioned reps. Interview each
provider you consider to understand the options and costs involved.

The former is a good option if you give the product price in an advertisement (hard offer), are offering
free information (lead generation), or don’t need trained salespeople who can overcome objections. In
other words, your ad or website is pre-qualifying prospects.

The latter would more appropriately be called “sales centers.” Operators are commissioned and trained
“closers” whose sole goal is to convert callers to buyers. These calls are often in response to “call for
information/ trial/sample” ads that don’t feature a price (soft offers). Expect higher costs per sale.

» LiveOps ( www.liveops.com )

service with agents, [VR, and Spanish. Often used for one-step order taking instead of soft offers.
