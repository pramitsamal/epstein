Earnings revisions trends. Basic Resources show strongest revisions trends and
revisions are still improving relative to trend, in light of the strong upside recently for
many metals prices. Autos revisions are next strongest and also show some positive
momentum. More broadly most sectors are not showing an improvement in the trend on
earnings revisions. Revisions are weakest in Tech having deteriorated more than other
sectors over the past six weeks. The improvement in Financials revisions continues and
Banks and Financial Services are now in positive territory.
