Some have taken a less sanguine view, arguing
that the “taper tantrum” of 2013 suggests bond
yields have already reached a troublesome level for
stocks. However, the tantrum primarily reflected
concerns that by tightening policy prematurely, the
Federal Reserve was committing a mistake that
would undermine growth—a fact evident in the
episode’s widening credit spreads and declining
breakeven inflation rates. Despite a similarly
rapid increase in rates this time around, we have
seen the opposite market reaction, with credit
spreads tightening and breakeven inflation rates
moving higher alongside growth expectations.
This contrast reminds us that the reason rates are
increasing is as important as their resulting level.

Aside from rates, ongoing concern about a
hard landing in China and a banking or political
crisis in Europe remain top of mind (see Section
I, The Risks to Our Outlook}. We also start the
year with less of a buffer to absorb such adverse
developments, given today’s high valuations. Even
worse, this narrower margin of safety arrives
at a time when policy uncertainty in the US is
particularly acute, given upcoming changes to
tax, trade and immigration policies under the new
administration. A destination tax, for example,
could be particularly damaging to S&P 500
margins given the growth of global supply chains
in the last decade, not to mention the sizable

upward pressure it would place on the US dollar.
Even at current levels, the dollar will represent a
renewed drag on US multinational earnings in the
first quarter (see Exhibit 60).

That said, the collective impact of these various
risks is not yet sizable enough to undermine our
core view: we are in a longer-than-normal US
recovery that supports equity returns that are
