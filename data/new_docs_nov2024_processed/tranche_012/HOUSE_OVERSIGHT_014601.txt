only add to existing concerns about pension
funding levels.

While there is clearly no shortage of risks, the
silver lining to last year’s rout is that we begin
2017 with a much larger valuation buffer to help
absorb them. As seen in Exhibit 83, the ratio
of municipal yields to Treasury yields is above
average for both 5- and 10-year maturities. In
turn, investors can currently earn an extra 70
basis points of after-tax yield by owning five-
year municipal bonds instead of same-maturity
Treasuries—a yield pickup more than double the
post-crisis median of 31 basis points. Moreover,
this incremental after-tax yield would still be
around 50 basis points if the top individual tax on
investment income were reduced by 10 percentage
points—from 43.4% with the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) tax to 33% under new policy
recommendations. In short, municipal spreads
currently offer a potential offset to rising rates and
potential tax changes.

Also keep in mind that municipal fundamentals
remain stable. Major state and local tax revenues
have continued to increase at a moderate 3% pace,
which should be supported by the above-trend
US economic growth and rising home prices we
forecast. Meanwhile, governments have exercised
restraint on capital spending. Consider that net
issuance expectations of $30 billion for 2017 stand
well below the pre-crisis 10-year annual average
of $110 billion.'!5 This restraint has not only kept

net supply low—as new issuance has been largely
offset by maturing debt—but has also helped
municipal finances. Ratings trends have improved
as a result of both stable revenue and spending
discipline, with upgrades in the Moody’s universe
seeing a notable uptick in last year’s third quarter
(see Exhibit 84).

Of course, underfunded long-term pension
liabilities remain a source of concern. But with
aggregate funding levels holding steady at around
74%, we do not think this will be a primary focus
in 2017, particularly given last year’s increase in
stock prices. While rising equity values will do
little to remedy municipals’ inadequate funding
contributions, they will help increase the value
of pension assets. Moreover, these medium-term
concerns are not the primary driver of recent
municipal bond weakness. After all, today’s
funding levels are no worse than they were in
October of last year, a time when municipal bonds
were enjoying some of their best returns ever.

All told, we expect intermediate municipal
strategies to gain about 1% in 2017. With
this return close to that of cash but with more
downside potential, we still think it makes sense
for clients to fund various tactical tilts from their
high-quality municipal bond allocation. This
recommendation is motivated primarily by rate
risk and not credit concerns, since we expect
municipal defaults to be rare events. Outside
tilt funding, we recommend clients target their
