1Q investment thesis

Based on past precedence, our view is that the AET/HUM deal is more likely than not to
be approved by the courts (ruling likely to come in January 2017). PF 2018 earnings
should be close to $11.50 (vs $9.70 consensus), even before taking into account the
upside from tax reform (+15% to EPS} and rising interest rates (+5%). In the event that
the deal breaks, we see little downside and potential upside in 1Q17 in the form of
capital deployment (AET remains underlevered and in the absence of a deal could look to
aggressively repurchase stock}. Current estimates do not include share repurchase and
based on its history of repurchasing shares using free cash flow and its balance sheet
capacity, we expect AET to repurchase a significant amount (~10%) of its shares in
2017 post deal break, providing initial downside support and ultimately driving upside to
Street estimates.

Deregulation/Gov't Legislation: Repeal and Replace of the ACA creates some
uncertainty, but neither AET nor HUM derive a significant amount of EPS from the ACA.
Meanwhile, Republicans have historically supported Medicare Advantage (80% of HUM’s
revenue}, and we expect a stronger rate environment under this Administration than
over the past 8 years.

Tax Policy: As a domestic only company with a relatively high tax rate (est. 35% in
2017), AET would benefit from tax reform. We believe that some benefit would be lost
to minimum MLR rebates or competition, but if taxes are lowered 15%, then we assume
that they keep about 2/3 of the benefit (19% to EPS).

Catalysts: Deal resolution, capital allocation update, tax reform, rising interest rates.

Latest report: MCO rally has just begun; beneficiaries of the non-Health
Care upside from Trump

1Q risks: Risks to the downside are courts not approving the HUM acquisition, lower-
than-expected membership growth and higher than expected cost trend. CMS will issue
the rate update for 2018 for Medicare Advantage in late February, a reg which we
expect to be benign, but which could be worse than expected.

Company Description: Aetna is one of the nation's largest managed care organizations,
covering roughly 23 million members. The company focuses on three main business
segments: Health Care (health insurance, dental, behavioral health and pharmacy benefit
