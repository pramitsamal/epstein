From a mark-to-market perspective, the risk to the trade is a further rise in 3m30y US
rates vol, coming this time with a depreciation in the USD (risk-off event in the US).

Potential US-China trade barriers: bullish CNH vol

The Republican clean sweep has already sparked a strong USD rally and US rates selloff,
but could put further pressure on the USDCNY exchange rate. A stronger USD by itself
adds pressure to depreciate as China still needs looser financial conditions to maintain
stability in the debt market, a relationship confirmed by the USDCNY rally following the
2015 Fed hike. With Trump’s victory, we see increased risk of a larger depreciation.

Trump publicly labeled China as a currency manipulator on multiple occasions during the
campaign, so any speculation of anti-trade policies could put significant depreciation
pressure on the Renminbi. Potential trade tariffs on Chinese exports to the US could
raise the probability of a trade war. Furthermore, Trump could encourage the Treasury
to alter its criteria for labelling currency manipulators, which could also hurt trade
relationships. Either scenario would lead to a sharp re-pricing of risk premia higher.

The Trade: Buy USDCNH 6m 7.60 call

We recommend buying a 6m USDCNH 7.60 call for 0.37% USD (off 6.9700
forward), with a target of 1% USD. USDCNH topside is now at the cheapest levels
since the August 2015 depreciation (Chart 56). The trade could benefit from either a
rally in spot as well as any increase in the risk premium between now and inauguration
on speculation of anti-trade policies. The structure appreciates significantly from
increases in volatility, which is plausible given the 300% increase in volatility in August
2015 and the 100% increase from October 2015 to February 2016. The risk to the trade
is that China increases capital controls and dampens USDCNH appreciation, which could
cause the options to expire worthless.
