Tail risk 3: China-led commodity weakness

Commodity collapse hedge: buy AUD/USD 6m 0.67 digital put

Metal and bulk commodity prices have skyrocketed in anticipation of infrastructure
spending in the US, We are wary of this rally: tax cuts are likely to be the first line of
fiscal stimulus and potentially easier to get through Congress than sizeable
infrastructure spending, which in any case will take a longer time to impact commodity
demand (allowing for supply adjustments). Perhaps most importantly, China is still the
swing factor for global commodity prices and the risks here remain to the downside.

The recent dramatic rise for China-linked bulk commodity prices, especially coal, has
been driven by a combination of supply and demand imbalances (China floods, pit
closures and inventory shortages) and an apparent rise in speculative activity in futures
markets that has already drawn attention from regulators (Chart 76). Our resource
analysts have raised forecasts but still see moderation over 2017 (Chart 77). The futures
forward curve has already moved into backwardation. We see iron ore prices back at
USD50/t in 2017 compared to a current spot price of USD74.

While global reflation might be positive for commodities, there are reasons for caution:

e We expect Chinese property investment, the most commodity-intensive sector of
the economy, to slow in 2017.

¢  Sizeable RMB depreciation would be an additional deflationary impulse for
industrial commodities.

« There will be a supply response as current prices bring uneconomic producers back
on line, admittedly with a lag.

¢ There is potential for trade friction to impact regional trade while higher US rates
are already impacting regional EM currencies. Australia is especially exposed to
intra-regional trade and resource demand from the region.

Persistent supply/demand imbalances ahead of Chinese New Year might delay
commodity weakness until after 1Q17, especially for coking coal due to a preference for
thermal coal supplies over the Chinese winter. However, the risk of a sharp reversal
beyond is worth hedging against given the demand dynamics in China, most obviously
through the AUD. While short-dated implied volatility rose following the US election, the
risk-reversal skew remains high as a percentage of implied volatility relative to G10
pairs. This suggests hedging via AUD/USD digital puts is appropriate, in our view.

Trade recommendation: Buy 6m AUD/USD 0.67 digital put, entry: 10% (spot
reference: 0.7550). Risk is global demand recovery provides support to commodity

prices.
