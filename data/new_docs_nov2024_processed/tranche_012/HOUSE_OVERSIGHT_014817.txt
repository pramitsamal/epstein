The Prince, a paedophile
and the sex slave teen

A MOTHER of three living in Australia has revealed she was a teenage prostitute flown all over the world
by a convicted sex offender to meet Prince Andrew.

The revelations have rocked Buckingham Palace as the woman, Virginia Roberts, 27, confessed

she was the minor identified in FBI and subsequent civil proceedings against wealthy financier

and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

A photo of Epstein and the Duke of York, Prince Andrew, together last week compelled Ms
Roberts to come forward.

First employed as a 15-year-old as Epstein's masseuse, she alleges he groomed her to become a
prostitute, paying her for sex with him and his influential friends.

While Ms Roberts said there was never any sexual relationship between the Prince and herself,
she claims that as a 17-year-old she met the Prince on three occasions - at one of which she was
told to sit on his knee while he touched another woman's breast.

Ms Roberts told London newspaper The Mail on Sunday she was first flown to England on a
private jet to meet the Prince in March 2001.

The 17-year-old was told to dance with the Prince and even posed for a photograph.
For her time with Epstein and the Prince on that trip, Epstein paid her $US15,000.

When she next met the Prince in the US, a 21-year-old woman who was working for Epstein
was sitting on Prince Andrew's knee. Ms Roberts said she was instructed to do the same while
the Prince touched the older woman's breast as a joke.
