Calendar puts are attractively priced given the steep term
structure

With the continuous low realized volatility environment, both
NKY and HSCEI 3-month minus 12-month term structures
steepened to -3.7 vol points, which are near multi-year lows.

As our Strategists think the Fed now appears concerned about
surging asset prices, investors should consider downside
hedges. Calendar puts, i.e. buying short-dated ATM puts and
selling long-dated OTM puts, are attractively priced given the
steep term structure.

Currently, we still have an open trade on NKY calendar puts (buy
Jul-17 19,500 puts vs sell Dec-17 17,500 puts) to hedge
downside risks.

The Bo)’s ongoing yield curve control has capped the
Nikkel/Topix ratio and its volatility

Japanese government bond (JGB) yield has been on a downward
trend over the last few years and has negatively impacted bank
earnings. As the Topix has higher weightings in banks than the

Nikkei, the NKY/TPX ratio has been grinding higher.

However, the NKY/TPX ratio appears to have flattened out since
the Bo}’s commitment to maintain the 10-year JGB yield at
around 0% in September 2016. With global central banks
increasingly advocating tighter monetary policies, the market
may start to speculate Bo)’s exit strategy and this may reverse
NKY/TPX’s upward trend. With TPX vol trading below NKY vol,
buying TPX calls funded by NKY calls may perform well in such a
scenario.
