See the little boy. He has leukemia. Too bad for him. The nice
lady is holding him up to the TV camera. Aren't you glad it's not
you? But wouldn't you like to be on television? Maybe you can fall
down a well.

See the pretty scoreboard. It tells how much money they get.
They want a million dollars. Uncle Sam has many millions of dollars.
He cuts medical research funds by more than seven million dollars.
Why? He needs the money for more important things.

See the mushroom cloud. That costs lots of money. It has
loads of particles. They cause leukemia. Money might help to find a
cure. That is why we have telethons.

See the tired man...
