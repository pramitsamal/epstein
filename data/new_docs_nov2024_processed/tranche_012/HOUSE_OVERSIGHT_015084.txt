reconcile. She came back, not for the money, but because she sincerely
believed that the nation needed Jack Kennedy, and she didn't want to bear
the burden of losing enough public favor to forestall his winning the
presidency.

Consequently she was destined to bear a quite different burden--
with great ambivalence--the paradox of fame. She enjoyed playing her role
to the hilt, but complained, “Can't they get it into their heads that there's
a difference between being the First Lady and being Elizabeth Taylor?”
Even after she became First Widow, the movie magazines would not--or
could not--leave her alone. Probably the most bizarre invasion of her
privacy occurred in Photoplay, which asked the question, “Too Soon for
Love?” --then proceeded to print a coupon that readers were requested
to answer and send in. They had a multiple choice: “Should Jackie (1)
Devote her life exclusively to her children and the memory of her husband?
(2) Begin to date--privately or publicly--and eventually remarry? (3)

“Marry right away?” Mrs. Kennedy fumed. “Why don't they give them
some more decisions to make for me? Some rea/ ones. Should | live in
occasional sin? Should | use a diaphragm or the pill? Should | keep it in the
medicine cabinet or the bureau drawer?” But she would never lose her

dignity in public; she had too deep a faith in her own image.
