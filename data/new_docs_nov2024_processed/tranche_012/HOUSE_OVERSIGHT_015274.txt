Swimming in the Dead Pool

When Ken Kesey’ s son Jed was killed in an accident--the van

carrying his University of Oregon wrestling team had skidded off a cliff--I
immediately flew to Oregon. “You were his favorite,” Kesey said as we
embraced, sobbing. “I feel like every cell in my body is exploding,”

A few days later, several of us old friends were sitting around the
dining-room table there, and someone mentioned that the Dead
Kennedys were on tour.

“| wonder if Ted Kennedy is gonna go see’ em,” | remarked.

Kesey, standing in the kitchen, responded, “That’ s not funny.”

“You' re right. | apologize. It’ s not very abstract right now.”
“It' s never abstract.”

| recalled that little dialogue as | began to explore The Game, now in
its 34th year [2004], the longest-running dead pool in America, currently
with 125 players. Before January 1st everyone submits 68 names of people
who might die that year. (Dr. Death, co-founder of The Game, liked to
work on a legal pad--34 lines, two columns, hence 68 names.) Points are
awarded according to the age of each dead person--anybody in their 50s

is worth five points; 60s, four; 70s, three.
