Prejean’ s Miss USA crown. And another thing. You promised to end the
raids on medical marijuana dispensaries, but they haven’ t stopped.

[In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder issued a memo ordering an
end to federal raids of medical marijuana dispensaries. In March 2011,
there were 28 such raids in a duration of 24 hours.]

Here’ s how | understand Washington. America’ s_ puritanical
political process serves as a buffer between the status quo and the force of
evolution. For instance, in order to get Republican votes for the children’ s
healthcare bill, Democrats agreed to fund $28 million to the/r abstinence-
only program.

And, during your own campaign, you admitted, in the context of
health care reform, that the multinational insurance conglomeration is so
firmly entrenched that you would be unable to dispense with it. So there
would have to be compromises. Now, what with the compromises made to
help passage of Prop. 19, amnesty becomes the single-payer system of
marijuana reform, and growing your own pot becomes the public option.
Meanwhile, as long as any government can arbitrarily decide which drugs
are legal and which drugs are illegal, then anyone serving time for a

nonviolent drug offense is a political prisoner.
