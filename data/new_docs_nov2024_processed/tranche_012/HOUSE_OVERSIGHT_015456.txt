6. | had taped an interview on an electric recorder-transcriber, plus a
battery-operated cassette recorder as a back-up precaution, which turned
out to be an absolute necessity when the electric recorder conked out
right in the middle.

Later on, | bought a new one to replace it, but first | had to get rid of
the old one. My desk consisted of a wooden door supported by a couple
of two-drawer filing cabinets. | was just too damn lazy to take all the
equipment and books off the desk so that | could move the desk toward
me and pull up the wire from behind it.

So | simply cut the wire with a pair of scissors. Bzzzzzt///| was shocked, but
not injured. Though the recorder had conked out, | had incredibly left the wire
still plugged into a socket on the surge protector. Where the scissors had cut the
wire, parts of the metal had melted away just a couple of inches from my hand. |
might’ ve been electrocuted. Yikes/

| could’ ve been killed, and the cause would’ ve been a simple lack
of the practice of mindfulness that | treasure so much. Instead, | had
emptied my mind. Oops, wrong discipline. But | was still alive, and |
thanked God for that. And then | heard a resplendent voice booming

through the clouds: “SHUT UP, YOU SUPERSTITIOUS FOOL!“
