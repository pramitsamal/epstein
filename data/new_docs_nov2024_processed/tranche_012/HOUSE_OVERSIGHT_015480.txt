Nitrogen: Your natural curls

The next time you brush your hair, think of the nitrog-
enous waste that helped create it. All of your proteins,
including hair keratin, contain formerly airborne
nitrogen atoms. But the nitrogen in air is biologically
inert. For nitrogen to become a component of your
hair, it has to be converted into a more accessible form.
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria is one way that can happen.
They live among the roots of beans, peas, and other
legumes, consuming atmospheric nitrogen and releas-
ing it as ammonia, a kind of microbial manure that
fertilizes soil in which plants grow. When you eat a
plant, you consume formerly atmospheric nitrogen.

Every flash of lightning and every automotive spark
plug emits a puff of nitrogen oxide, which can dissolve
into raindrops and fall to earth as a form of fertilizer,
again finding its way into food webs through plants.
But most of the nitrogen in modern foods comes from
urea and ammonium nitrate fertilizers artificially fixed
by industrial processes. In ages past, the nitrogen in
human hair came mainly from bacterial waste and
lightning. But today, unless you eat a strictly organ-
ic diet, you run your hairbrush through nitrogenous
frameworks that are mostly of human origin.
