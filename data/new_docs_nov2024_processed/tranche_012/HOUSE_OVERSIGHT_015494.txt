to sequence his wife’s genomes. He paid several thou-
sand dollars from his own pocket to learn his wife had
calpainopathy.

The Topics had no such luxury. But they did have
luck. Cornelius Boerkoel, a clinical geneticist at the
University of British Columbia, enrolled the Topics
in one of his studies, and so they didn’t have to pay to
have each of the family member’s genomes sequenced.
The genome tests gave Ivana and Antonia the bad
news about calpainopathy. Their younger brother,
Mario, is free of the disease.

Scientists classify calpainopathy, or “calpain,” as
a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2a, caused
by a mutation in the gene calpain 3, predominantly
expressed in skeletal muscle. Those who suffer from
Type 2a, such as Wrubel, Ivana, and Antonia, gener-
ally exhibit weak hip flexors—muscles that lift up the
thigh. The weak flexors give them an awkward gait;
they swing their legs forward, landing on their toes,
and then sometimes on the sides or soles of their feet.
Some walk only on the balls of their feet. The upper
body muscle weakness creates abnormally prominent
shoulder blades.

Melissa Spencer from the University of California,
Los Angeles, who has studied calpainopathy for 14
years, explains that the disease contains many sub-
types. The problem with Type 2a, she says, “was a
