others repeat such false and defamatory statements and thereby further damaged Giuffre’s
reputation.

33. | Maxwell made her statements to discredit Giuffre in close consultation with
Epstein. Maxwell made her statements knowing full well they were false.

34. | Maxwell made her statements maliciously as part of an effort to conceal sex
trafficking crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, Epstein and other powerful persons.

35. | Maxwell intended her false and defamatory statements set out above to be
broadcast around the world and to intimidate and silence Giuffre from making further efforts to
expose sex crimes committed by Maxwell, Epstein, and other powerful persons.

36. | Maxwell intended her false statements to be specific statements of fact, including
a statement that she had not recruited an underage Giuffre for Epstein’s abuse. Maxwell’s false
statements were broadcast around the world and were reasonably understood by those who heard
them to be specific factual claims by Maxwell that she had not helped Epstein recruit or sexually
abuse Giuffre and that Giuffre was a liar.

Shs On or about January 4, 2015, Maxwell continued her campaign to falsely and
maliciously discredit Giuffre. When a reporter on a Manhattan street asked Maxwell about
Giuffre’s allegations against Maxwell, she responded by saying: “I am referring to the statement
that we made.” The New York Daily News published a video of this response by Maxwell
indicating that she made her false statements on East 65 Street in Manhattan, New York, within

the Southern District of New York.
