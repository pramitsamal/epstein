Mind over Computer 19

To give you some idea of how Moore's Law works, the graph shows
growth in computing power over time; the y-axis is a logarithmic plot
using engineering notation. Because the growth is exponential we rapidly
end up with very large numbers. Scientists use a special notation to cope
with these large and small numbers. In scientific notation a number
is written out in a compact form. For example, three hundred can be
written as 3.0 x 10’. To expand it back to a regular number you move the
decimal point in 3.0 two spots to the right, making the number 300.0. A
similar technique is used for small numbers. To expand 3.0 x 10? move
the decimal point 2 points to the left, giving 0.03. Why use scientific
notation? Well, once the numbers get large they would no longer fit on
a page! We can shorten the representation of numbers even further by
dropping the ‘3.0 x’ part and just looking at the order of magnitude.
The number 10°, one with eighty zeroes after it, is the number of atoms
in the Earth, and 10’ the number of particles in the known Universe.
10° meters is the ‘plank number’ believed to be the smallest dimension
you can have, and 10!” is called a googol, named by Milton Sirotta, the

Moore’s Law is only one example
