Mind over Computer 45

you if this crowd-sourced random
number generator really works.
There should be no way to predict
the resulting number as both
of you are affected by quantum
randomness and, provided you
wait a little before shouting stop,
any social stereotyping should
be overcome. If you want to be
scientific, remember the random
number you started with and the
length of time before your friend
shouted stop. There should be an
improvement in randomness with
the amount of time they wait.

In the absence of human
interaction another way to give
a computer access to a random
number is from a quantum
device. A lava lamp works well!
The Lavarand, developed by
Silicon Graphics, is a hardware
random number generator which
uses images of a lava lamp to seed
a random number generator. It is
covered by U.S. Patent 5,732,138, fave Lamp
titled “Method for seeding a pseudo-random number generator with a
cryptographic hash of a digitization of a chaotic system.’ Got that!

A computer does not acquire free will just through the injection of
randomness. You could simply put an intercept on the link from the lava
lamp to the computer and completely predict the computer’s behavior.
The system as a whole will certainly do unpredictable things, but the
computer did not make a choice; behaving randomly is not exercising
free will. Where is the will?

Consciousness

I remember my first trip to Death Valley in the United States. We were
driving along the main east-west highway at the bottom of the valley
and a sign said, “Turn off your air conditioning now.’ I did as I was told
and to cool down I opened the window. When I put my hand out I felt
