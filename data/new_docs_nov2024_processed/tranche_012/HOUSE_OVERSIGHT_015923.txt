Can't be Fired

uman brains are wonderfully creative things. We can compose
H music, play golf, write novels, and turn our hands to all manner

of problems. Many people use their brains to write software. In
our modern-day lives we use software all the time: when we access the
web, type on a word processor or play a computer game. Software also
inhabits many apparently dumb devices. Modern cars contain dozens
of computers quietly working away; providing entertainment and
navigation, controlling the engine, and helping the car brake safely. In
my living room I count over a hundred computers. Many are tiny, like
the one in my TV remote control, while others are hidden as parts of
larger machines. The laptop on which I write has over twenty computers
inside it, besides the main Intel processor.

One thing all these computers have in common is that a human
being sat for many hours writing their software. Software is formal logic
written in something resembling English.

If I go to my ATM and try to withdraw cash, a programmer will
have written out the logic for the transaction as a set of rules.

When I put my bankcard in the slot, and type in my PIN, a line of
software will ask: If the bank balance of ‘James Tagg’ is less than twenty
dollars and I have pressed ‘withdraw for an amount in excess of twenty
dollars, then display, “We are sorry we cannot process the transaction at
this time.” and return the card. There seems to be an unwritten rule that
the things a computer says should be accurate but unhelpful!
