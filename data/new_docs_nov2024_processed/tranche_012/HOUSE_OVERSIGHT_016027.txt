Quantum Morse Machine

A Simple Free Will Theorem

In the quantum Morse machine, I do transmit information faster than the
speed of light. But the information I have transmitted is useless as it is, in
effect, encrypted using a one-time pad. The only person in possession of
a copy of this one-time pad is me: the sender.

Claude Shannon proved a one-time pad is unbreakable during the
Second World War. Yet the British succeeded in breaking it. How was
this possible?

The fatal weakness in the German one-time pads was the random
numbers used to code the messages were generated by a machine, and
were therefore not truly random. The numbers followed a sequence,
and it was possible for Allied code breakers to work out the sequence
and decode the messages. It follows that if we believe no message can
propagate faster than the speed of light, my sequence of numbers must
be non-computable. There must be no algorithm or computation that
could generate it. Otherwise it would be liable to the same sort of
decryption attack that the one-time pads suffered. If sequences of random
measurements taken in the universe are non-computable it follows the
Universe as a whole must be non-computable.

There are a few holes you could pick in this argument. Would it
be sufficient if it were impossible to decrypt the message in the age of
the Universe? What if there was an algorithm, but it was practically
unknowable? But, I am talking here of principle. In principle, the
Universe must be non-decryptable.
