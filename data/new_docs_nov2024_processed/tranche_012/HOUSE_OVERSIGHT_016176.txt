Tax on land: a lever to lower real estate prices in urban areas

Given that the government is giving landlords a grace period in order to either develop
or sell land to developers, we perceive the newly approved land tax as a lever to lower
real estate prices. Ultimately, this would improve household affordability, reduce social
tensions and indirectly tackling energy subsidies as it frees up potential household
income to spend on electricity and gasoline.

Land tax could generate up to US$11bn/yr from the major urban cities

We estimate that the government could potentially collect up to US$11bn per annum of
tax related to undeveloped land in the top 5 urban Saudi cities which accommodate
more than 50% of the Saudi population. While the law will not be effective until end-
2016, we do not expect the tax proceeds to be significant early on.
