°° See Harmon, Policing Reform, supra note 21 (discussing structural reform aimed at police violence without noting any instances of
targeting sexual assault offenses).

°° Leading observers view this structural reform as insufficient to address the scope of the police-misconduct problems. See id. at 59-61
(describing injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § /4/4/, noting limits on data about police misconduct, and explaining how insufficient data
limits the effectiveness of reform efforts). On the prospect of reduced federal commitment to this strategy in the Trump administration, see
U.S. Attorney Gen., supra note 24; Horwitz et al., supra note 24.

197 See Dripps, supra note 149, at 19 & n.100 (citing five federal actions under § 14141 addressing local agencies' responses to sexual assault
crimes).

198 That is, federal criminal law is effective at successful prosecutions, if not at reducing the underlying social problem targeted by criminal
law. See generally, e.g., Steven B. Duke & Albert C. Gross, America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs (1993)
(examining and critiquing American drug policies).

199 See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 241 (2012) (criminalizing conspiracy); id. § 242 (criminalizing willful deprivation of federal rights while acting
under color of law); id. § 249 (criminalizing willful bodily injury because of victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity).
Federal prosecutors focus on other serious direct-victim crimes as well, such as human trafficking and child pornography. See U.S. Dep't of
Justice, supra note 145 (describing prioritization of such cases). But federal involvement in that realm is presumably motivated not so much
by a need for oversight of untrustworthy state prosecutors as by the greater resources, expertise, and interstate jurisdictional advantages that
federal prosecutors bring to such cases. Criminal prosecution is only one aspect of federal policies to reduce custodial deaths and improper
uses of force by police. Other strategies include investigating abuse and corruption in local police agencies and using civil injunctive
remedies against those agencies to change patterns of wrongdoing, as well as gathering data on custodial deaths and police uses of force. See
Harmon, Policing Reform, supra note 21; Simone Weichselbaum, Policing the Police: As the Justice Department Pushes Reform, Some
Changes Don't Last, Marshall Project (May 26, 2015), https:/Avww.themarshallproject.org/2015/04/23/policing -the-police (describing the
difficulties in achieving lasting reforms in local police departments through federal consent decrees).

200 See 18 U.S.C. § 242 (liability for an official who willfully subjects any person ... to the deprivation of any [federal] rights); United
States v. Screws, 325 U.S. 91, 103 (1945) (interpreting § 242's willfulness term to require specific intent to deprive a person of a federal
right).

201 The prosecution of South Carolina police officer Michael Slager provides an example. State prosecutors charged Slager with murder;
federal prosecutors charged him with criminal violation of civil rights under 18 U.S.C. § 242. For an example of this contrast between state
and federal charges for the same offense, see Blinder, supra note 52; Michael S. Schmidt & Matt Apuzzo, Officer Is Charged with Murder of
