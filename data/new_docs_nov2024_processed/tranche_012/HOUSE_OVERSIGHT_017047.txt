Fig. S8. Example of grammatical change. Irregular verbs are used as a model of grammatical evolution.
For each verb, we plot the usage frequency of its irregular form in red (for instance, ‘found’), and the
usage frequency of its regular past-tense form in blue (for instance, ‘finded’). Virtually all irregular verbs
are found from time to time used in a regular form, but those used more often tend to be used in a
regular way more rarely. This is illustrated in the top two rows with the frequently-used verb “find” and
the less often encountered “dwell”. In the third row, the trajectory of “thrive” is one of many ways by

which regularization occurs. The bottom two panels shows that the regularization of “spill” happened

earlier in the US than in the UK.
