Fig. $13. Values of the four parameters of fame as a function of time. ‘Age of peak celebrity’ (75 years
old) has been fairly consistent. Celebrities are noticed earlier, and become more famous than ever
before: ‘Age of initial celebrity’ has dropped from 43 to 29 years, and ‘Doubling time’ has dropped from
8.1 to 3.3 years. But they are forgotten sooner as well: the half-life has declined from 120 years to 71.
