The jury at the second trial, having heard our new scientific evidence, acquitted Murphy of
murder. They believed neither the burking nor the cocktail theory. The more like cause of death,
they concluded, was a self-administered overdose of heroin. Murphy now lives in California,
where she runs an art gallery.

even though there was little other evidence of Binion's state of mind before his death. But
if the statement was relevant to show Binion's state of mind at the time he made the
statement, the exception still does not allow the statement to be used as evidence of the
intent or conduct of anyone else-in this case, Murphy. The district court did not give a
limiting instruction advising the jury that the statement was only admissible for the limited
purpose of showing Binion's state of mind.”
