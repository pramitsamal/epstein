Mazoltuv Borukhova

In February 2011, I argued the appeal of Mazoltuv Borukhova, whose murder conviction became
the basis of Janet Malcolm’s best seller, Iphigenia in Forest Hills: Anatomy of a Murder Trial.
Borukhova, a young doctor who recently immigrated from Bukhara in the former Soviet Union,
was involved in a hotly contested divorce and custody suit with her dentist husband, who had also
immigrated from Bukhara. Mazoltuv was accused of hiring a cousin from the State of Georgia to
come up to Queens and murder her husband. She was convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment. The major issue on appeal was similar to the one that resulted in the reversal of
Sandra Murphy’s conviction, namely a hearsay statement, testified to by the murder victim’s
father, describing a statement allegedly made by the murder victim that suggested he feared being
killed by his estranged wife. The court ruled that this statement should not have been admitted
into evidence, but that the other evidence presented to the jury was so overwhelming, that the
error of admitting the hearsay was “harmless’”—that means that the jury would have convicted
Borukhova even if they had never heard this inadmissible evidence. Appellate courts are not
really in a good position to evaluate what a jury would have concluded if certain evidence had
been excluded. The case is now on habeus corpus.
