victims’ rights. In their view, such statutes frequently fail to provide meaningful protection whenever they come into conflict
with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, [or] sheer inertia. 7° As the Justice Department reported:

Efforts to secure victims’ rights through means other than a constitutional amendment have proved less than fully adequate.
Victims’ rights advocates have sought reforms at the state level for the past twenty years, and many states have responded with
state statutes and [*868] constitutional provisions that seek to guarantee victims' rights. However, these efforts have failed to
fully safeguard victims’ rights. These significant state efforts simply are not sufficiently consistent, comprehensive, or
authoritative to safeguard victims’ rights. *?

To place victims’ rights in the constitution, victims advocates (led most prominently by the National Victims Constitutional
Amendment Network 3°) approached the President and Congress about a federal amendment. 3' In April 22, 1996, Senators
Kyl and Feinstein introduced a federal victims’ rights amendment with the backing of President Clinton. 3? The intent of the
amendment was to restore, preserve, and protect, as a matter of right for the victims of violent crimes, the practice of victim
participation in the administration of criminal justice that was the birthright of every American at the founding of our Nation.
33 A companion resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives. *4 The proposed amendment embodied seven core
principles: (1) the right to notice of proceedings, (2) the right to be present, (3) the right to be heard, (4) the right to notice of
the defendant's release or escape, (5) the right to restitution, (6) the right to a speedy trial, and (7) the right to reasonable
protection. In a later resolution, an eighth principle was added: standing. 3°

The amendment failed to pass in the 104th Congress. On January 21, 1997, the opening day of the first session of the 105th
Congress, Senators Kyl and Feinstein reintroduced the amendment. *° A series of hearings were held that year in both the
House and the Senate. *7 Responding to some of the concerns raised in these hearings, the amendment was reintroduced the
following year. 38 The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings *° and passed the proposed amendment. * However, the
full Senate did not consider the amendment. In 1999, Senators Kyl [*869] and Feinstein again proposed the amendment. +!
On September 30, 1999, the Judiciary Committee again voted to send the amendment to the full Senate. ** But on April 27,
