the defense have reciprocal rights and courts apply the Rules consistently.
The objectionable feature of the Advisory Committee proposal is that the subpoena could be issued without notice to a crime
victim. A narrower issue is whether certain pleadings could be filed on this question on an ex parte basis. Such ex parte filing
might be appropriate, in the sense that once the court gives notice that it is considering whether to issue a subpoena, then the
defendant, the government, or, indeed, the victim might wish to file parts of their pleadings under seal for good cause shown.
Requests for such sealing could be handled in the ordinary course of litigation - once the victim knew that such litigation was
occurring.

Even if there is some tangential defense interest in conceding strategy, the Advisory Committee proposal addresses it in the
most haphazard way. Consider the Elizabeth Smart example mentioned earlier, in which the defense sent ex parte subpoenas to
Elizabeth's school and hospital. Under the Advisory Committee's proposal, a court could still decide to approve those
subpoenas ex parte to prevent disclosure of some secret defense strategy. But once the school and the hospital received the
subpoenas, nothing would bar them from revealing the subpoenas’ existence to the victim - and, indeed, the world. Thus, the
interest the Advisory Committee purports to protect (concealing defense trial strategy) would actually be [*908] protected
only when the third party, for whatever reason, chose not reveal the subpoena. In the Smart case, for instance, the school did
not reveal the defense strategy ?°° because it simply handed the materials over to the defense - in possible contravention of
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 7°? But the hospital refused to hand over Elizabeth's records and contacted the
Smart family, which ultimately led to a public outcry over the subpoenas. There is no rhyme or reason to a procedure that is
supposed to protect defense strategy but that actually turns on the happenstance of whether third parties choose to notify crime
victims or the public about subpoenas they receive.

The haphazardness of the Advisory Committee's approach becomes even clearer when one realizes that defense strategy can
be protected only where the confidential information happens to rest in the hands of a third party rather than the victim herself.
Consider, for example, a rape victim who has talked to a rape crisis counselor, who takes notes of the meeting. A defendant
might attempt to subpoena those notes from the counselor. 7° But if the counselor had previously transferred the notes back to
the rape victim, then the subpoena would have to be directed to the victim herself - and the victim could then move to quash the
subpoena. This is not some academic hypothetical, as rape counselors in Pennsylvania in the 1980s used precisely this
procedure to protect their clients against abusive defense subpoenas. 7°! Moreover, rape counselors - and, indeed, most third
parties involved in maintaining the personal and confidential information of victims - will probably have very strong incentives

257 See Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 475-76 (1973); United States v. Bahamonde, 445 F.3d 1225, 1229 (9th Cir. 2006); Newman v.
Hopkins, 192 F.3d 1132, 1135 (8th Cir. 1999), vacated 529 U.S. 1084 (2000); United States ex rel. Veal v. DeRobertis, 693 F.2d 642, 646-
47 (7th Cir. 1982). Indeed, such reciprocity may not even be required if significant governmental interests support its omission. See
Wardius, 412 U.S. at 476.

258 Such as it was - apparently the only reason for the subpoenas was to try and dig up some dirt on the young kidnapping victim. See

260 As will be discussed shortly in the next Section of this Article, such a subpoena would likely be inappropriate for substantive reasons as
well. See supra Part IV, § 3.

261 The Pennsylvania Supreme Court initially found that records held by rape counseling centers were subject to only limited protection from
defense subpoenas. See Jn re Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 428 A.2d 126, 132 (Pa. 1981). The results of that unfortunate decision were
swift. Rape victims requested the return of their records from the center and, in some cases, even requested termination of the counseling
relationship. Commonwealth v. Wilson, 602 A.2d 1290, 1294 n.6 (Pa. 1992); Tera Jckowski Peterson, Comment, Distrust and Discovery: The
Impending Debacle in Discovery of Rape Victims' Counseling Records in Utah, 2007 Utah L. Rev. 695; Beth Stouder, Note, Pennsylvania
Establishes New Privilege for Communications Made to a Rape Crisis Center Counselor - In re Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 55 Temp.
L.Q. 1124, 1146 (1982). In light of this serious problem, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a new, absolute privilege protecting
communications to rape crisis counselors from any disclosure without the consent of the victim. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5945.1(b) (2000)
(upheld against constitutional attack in Wilson, 602 A.2d at 1297).
