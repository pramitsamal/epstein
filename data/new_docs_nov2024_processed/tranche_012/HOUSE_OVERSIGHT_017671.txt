good faith and is not intended as a general fishing expedition.
Because of this governing law, I proposed that Rule 17 should itself identify restrictions on a defendant's ability to subpoena
confidential information. My proposal incorporates specificity, relevancy, and admissibility components - conforming with,
rather than altering, existing law. My current proposal 7°° requires the information be specifically described and admissible at
trial - and it bars evidence sought for impeachment purposes only. In contrast, the Advisory Committee seemingly enlarges the
substantive rights of defendants by failing to reference even a single Nixon factor in its proposal. Thus, unless a court takes it
upon itself to ensure the relevancy, specificity, and admissibility of the subpoenas, [*912] the Advisory Committee proposal
might provide the defendant with license to conduct the very fishing expedition that Nixon forbids.

The proposed Advisory Committee Note adds to this confusion. The Note indicates that in considering whether to issue the
subpoena, the court should consider the relevance of the subpoenaed material to the defense. 78! But this is an overly broad
formulation. The court should only consider the relevance of the material to the defense at trial, since this is the only
permissible basis for a subpoena.

Current law clearly limits Rule 17 subpoenas to evidence that is admissible at trial. 2°? The reason for Nixon's limitations of
relevance, admissibility, and specificity is that subpoenas are not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal cases
but only to expedite the trial by providing a time and place before trial for the inspection of subpoenaed materials. 78? With
regard to admissibility, Nixon explained that generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to require its
production in advance of trial. 784 In other words, documents sought for the narrow purpose of impeachment are not
evidentiary for the purposes of Rule 17. 7°° In Nixon, only because the prosecutor made a sufficient preliminary showing that
the subpoenaed tapes contained evidence admissible with respect to the offenses charged in the indictment and that the
evidence could be validly used as nonimpeachment evidence, did the Court find the evidence to be subpoenable. 78°

Courts apply Nixon's admissibility test strictly, rejecting, for example, subpoenas for hearsay evidence that would be
inadmissible at trial. 78” The cases have recognized that broad subpoenas run afoul of these limitations - including subpoenas
seeking information about crime victims. 7°* For example, in United States v. Hang, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district

279 Id. at 699-700 (citing United States v. Iozia, 13 F.R.D. 335, 338 (S.D.N.Y. 1952)).

280 My earlier proposal specifically required that no subpoena would issue without a finding by the court that the information is relevant to
trial. Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 875 (emphasis added). In view of the importance of the Nixon factors, it now seems
desirable to spell them all out, as my current proposal does.
