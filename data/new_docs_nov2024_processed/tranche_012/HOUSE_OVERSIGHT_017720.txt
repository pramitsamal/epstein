to make its best efforts to ensure [*845] that victims’ rights were protected. ” Yet this federal statute never successfully
integrated victims into the federal criminal justice process and instead became something of a dead letter. Because Congress
passed the CVRA in 2004 to remedy the problems with the 1990 Act, a brief review of the law's shortcomings is valuable.

Curiously, the 1990 Victims' Rights and Restitution Act was codified in Title 42 of the United States Code - the Title dealing
with Public Health and Welfare. Such placement effectively limited the Act's effectiveness because federal practitioners
reflexively consult Title 18, the Title that covers Crimes and Criminal Procedure, *4 for guidance on criminal law issues.
More prosaically, federal criminal enactments are bound together in a single West publication entitled the Federal Criminal
Code and Rules. This publication is carried to court by prosecutors and defense attorneys and is on the desk of most federal
judges. Because West Publishing never included the Victims' Rights Act i this book, the statute was essentially unknown even
to experienced judges and attorneys. 4°

The prime illustration of the ineffectiveness of the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act comes from the Oklahoma City
bombing case. *° While one might expect victims’ rights would have been fully protected during such a high profile trial, in
fact victims were denied one fundamental right: the right to observe court proceedings. During a pretrial motion hearing, the
district court sua sponte precluded any victim who wished to provide victim impact testimony at sentencing from observing
proceedings in the case. +7 The court based its ruling on Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence - the so-called Rule on

Witnesses. 4° Thirty-five victims and survivors of [*846] the bombing then filed a motion for reconsideration. *? They
noted that the district court apparently had overlooked the Victims’ Rights Act giving victims the right to be present at all
public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially
affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial. *° The district court denied the motion for reconsideration. *! It
concluded that victims present during court proceedings would not be able to separate the experience of trial from the
experience of loss from the conduct in question, and, thus, their testimony at a sentencing hearing would be inadmissible. °?
Unlike the original ruling, which was explicitly premised on Rule 615, the later ruling was more ambiguous, alluding to

concerns under the Constitution, the common law, and the rules of evidence. >?

4 Last year, I wrote a letter to West Publishing requesting that they include the law in their book. That request became moot with the passage
of the CVRA, which moved victims’ rights from obscurity in Title 42 to centrality in Title 18, thereby guaranteeing them a spot in the West
publication.
