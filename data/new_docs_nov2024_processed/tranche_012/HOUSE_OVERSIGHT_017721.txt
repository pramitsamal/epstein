2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *846

The victims subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit seeking
review of the district court's ruling. *4 Three months later, a Tenth Circuit panel rejected the victims' claims. >> The circuit
found a number of problems with the excluded witnesses’ reliance on the Victims’ Rights Act. °° Indeed, the circuit found
that the Act created no obligations for courts:

[*847]

The statute charily pledges only the best efforts of certain executive branch personnel to secure the rights listed. The district
court judge, a judicial officer not bound in any way by this pledge, could not violate the Act. Indeed, the Act's prescriptions
were satisfied once the government made its arguments against sequestration - before the district court even ruled. >”

Efforts by both the victims and the Department of Justice to obtain a rehearing were unsuccessful, °® despite the support of
separate briefs urging such a rehearing from forty-nine members of Congress, all six Attorneys General in the Tenth Circuit,
and some of the leading victims' groups in the nation. >?

In the meantime, the victims, supported by the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, sought remedial legislation in Congress
clearly providing that victims should not have to decide between testifying at sentencing or watching the trial. A bill was
introduced to provide that watching a trial in a capital case does not constitute grounds for denying a victim the chance to
provide an impact statement. In a matter of weeks, Congress passed the Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997, © but even
that specific statute failed to protect the bombing victims’ rights. The district court in the Oklahoma City case found that the
statute had constitutional problems. ©!

Because of the difficulty accompanying the statutory protection of victims’ rights, victims advocates decided to press for a
federal constitutional amendment. They argued that the statutory [*848] protections could not sufficiently guarantee victims'
rights. In their view, such statutes frequently fail to provide meaningful protection whenever they come into conflict with
bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, [or] sheer inertia. ©? As the Justice Department reported:

Efforts to secure victims’ rights through means other than a constitutional amendment have proved less than fully adequate.
Victims’ rights advocates have sought reforms at the state level for the past [twenty] years, and many states have responded
