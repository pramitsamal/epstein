Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)

of action for trespass under New York law
pursuant to concerted action theory.

86. Damages €757.14, 57.27

In New York, a plaintiff may establish
negligent infliction of emotional distress
under the bystander or direct duty theory.

87. Damages €°57.27

Under the bystander theory for prov-
ing negligent infliction of emotional dis-
tress under New York law, a defendant’s
conduct is negligent as creating an unrea-
sonable risk of bodily harm to a plaintiff,
and such conduct is a substantial factor in
bringing about injuries to the plaintiff in
consequence of shock or fright resulting
from his or her contemporaneous observa-
tion of serious physical injury or death
inflicted by the defendant’s conduct on a
member of the plaintiff's immediate family
in his or her presence.

88. Damages €-57.14

Under the direct duty theory for
proving negligent infliction of emotional
distress under New York law, a plaintiff
suffers emotional distress caused by defen-
dant’s breach of a duty which unreason-
ably endangered the plaintiff's own physi-
cal safety.

89. Negligence ¢=202

To establish a claim for negligence
under New York law, a plaintiff must show
that the defendant owed the plaintiff a
cognizable duty of care, that the defendant
breached that duty, and that the plaintiff
suffered damages as a proximate cause of
that breach.

90. Negligence <=210

The most basic element of a negli-
gence claim under New York law is the
existence of a duty owed to plaintiffs by
defendants.

91. Banks and Banking <-100

Under New York negligence law,
banks do not owe non-customers a duty to
protect them from the intentional torts of
their customers.

92. Damages €757.18

Negligence <=210

Survivors of victims of September 11,
2001 attacks failed to state causes of action
in complaint against alleged supporters of
terrorists for negligence and negligent in-
fliction of emotional distress, inasmuch as
they failed to allege or identify duty owed
to them by defendants.

93. War and National Emergency <=50

In light of extreme nature of charge of
terrorism, fairness required extra-careful
scrutiny of allegations by survivors of vic-
tims of September 11, 2001 attacks as to
any particular defendant, to ensure that
he, or it, had fair notice of claims, includ-
ing claims under Antiterrorism Act (ATA).
18 U.S.C.A. § 2331 et seq.

94. Banks and Banking ¢=226

Allegations in complaint by survivors
of victims of September 11, 2001 attacks,
that Saudi Arabian bank aided and abetted
terrorists by donating to charities and act-
ing as bank for charities, failed to state
cause of action under Antiterrorism Act
(ATA) against bank, in that survivors of-
fered no facts to support conclusion that
bank knew of charities’ alleged support for
terrorism, and failed to allege relationship
between Hamas, with which bank allegedly
had ties, and September 11 terrorists. 18
U.S.C.A. § 2331 et seq.

95. Conspiracy 1.1

Torts 21

Under New York law, concerted ac-
tion liability, pursuant to a conspiracy or
aiding and abetting theory, requires gener-
al knowledge of the primary actor’s con-
duct.
