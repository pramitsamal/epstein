Prince Turki is also alleged to have at-
tempted to protect Saudi Arabia from ter-
rorism and to have implemented the King-
dom’s foreign relations with the Taliban
and Osama bin Laden. In determining
whether these were discretionary func-
tions, the Court must decide whether the
actions involved an element of choice or
judgment based on considerations of public
policy. See Callahan v. United States, 329
F.Supp.2d 404, 408 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (inter-
preting FTCA); Berkowitz v. United
States, 486 U.S. 531, 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954,
100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988) (construing FTCA).

[29,30] There can be little doubt that,
as the chairman of the Supreme Council of
Islamic Affairs, charged with making rec-
ommendations to the Council of Ministers
regarding requests for aid from Islamic
organizations located abroad, and as the
head of the Special Committee of the
Council of Ministers, charged with decid-
ing which grants should be made to Islam-
ic charities, Prince Sultan’s decisions were
made at the planning level of government,

in social, economic, and political policy,”
Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct.
2755. Similarly, as the head of DGI,
Prince Turki’s decisions regarding the
treatment of the Taliban and Osama bin
Laden were judgments based on consider-
ations of public policy. See Callahan v.
United States, 329 F.Supp.2d at 408; see
also Burnett If, 292 F.Supp.2d at 20-21
({TJhis conclusion would be nearly self-
evident: Prince Turki, as director of intel-
ligence, taking acts to protect Saudi Arabia
from terrorism, and Prince Sultan, as
chairman of the Supreme Council, making
recommendations to the Council of Minis-
ters about requests for assistance from
Islamic organizations outside Saudi Arabia

clearly making ‘decisions grounded in so-
cial, economic, and political policy, ”)
(quoting Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814,
104 S.Ct. 2755).

Accordingly, to the extent that Plaintiffs
allege acts Prince Sultan and Prince Turki
performed in their official capacities,
Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s motions
to dismiss the certain consolidated com-
plaints and the Federal complaint are
granted. The Court denies Plaintiffs’ re-
quest for jurisdictional discovery because
Plaintiffs have not presented any factual
basis for believing that discovery might
reasonably be expected to result in evi-
dence that would overcome the discretion-
ary function exception. See 28 U.S.C.
§ 1605(a)(5)(A) (exception not applicable to
“any claim based upon the exercise or
performance or the failure to exercise or
perform a discretionary function regard-
less of whether the discretion be abused.”)
The Court will consider the appropriate-
ness of exercising personal jurisdiction
over Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s
personal acts in Part II below.

b. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

There is no dispute that the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia is a foreign state within the
meaning of the FSIA. Federal Complaint

“burden of going forward with evidence
that, under exceptions to the FSIA, immu-
nity should not be pranted.” Virtual
Countries, 300 F.3d at 241 Gnternal quota-
tions omitted). As explained above, the
only possible applicable exception is the
torts exception under 28 U.S.C.
§ 1605(a)(5).

[31,32] The Federal Plaintiffs’ allega-
tions arise “predominantly from miscon-
