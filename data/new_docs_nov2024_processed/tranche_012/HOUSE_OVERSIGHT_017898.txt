with the opportunity to clarify their claims
against Al Rajhi Bank, the Burnett Plain-
tiffs do not offer facts to support their
conclusions that Al Rajhi Bank had to
know that Defendant charities WAMY,
MWL, IIRC, and SJRC were supporting
terrorism. See Rule 12(e) Statement
11 44-60. “[A] complaint which consists of
conclusory allegations unsupported by fac-
tual assertions fails even on the liberal
standard of Rule 12(b)(6).” De Jesus v.
Sears, Roebuck & Co. 87 F.3d 65, 70 (2d
Cir.1996).

This Court, like Judge Robertson before
it, has found no basis for a bank’s liability
for injuries funded by money passing
through it on routine banking business.
See Burnett [, 274 F.Supp.2d at 109. Sim-
ilarly, allegations concerning the Al Rajhi
family cannot support a claim against Al
Rajhi Bank because there is no allegation
that the family members were acting in
furtherance of Al Rajhi Bank business.

(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 1997). Plaintiffs attach
to their opposition brief a September 2002
SAMA report summarizing the initiatives
and actions taken by the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia to combat money laundering and
terrorist financing. See Burnett Plaintiffs’
Opp. to Al Rajhi Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 2.
Neither this document, nor the complaint,
alleges that SAMA or Al Rajhi Bank im-
plemented “know your customer” rules
that Al Rajhi failed to follow with respect
to accounts held by the Defendant chari-
ties. Finally, Plaintiffs’ allegations that Al
Rajhi Bank has connections to Hamas sup-
porters fails to state a claim because Plain-
tiffs have not alleged any relationship be-
tween Hamas and al Qaeda or the terrorist

attacks of September 11. Even accepting
all the allegations against Al Rajhi Bank as
true, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim
that would entitle them to relief. Accord-
ingly, Al Rajhi Bank’s motion to dismiss
the Burnett complaint is granted in its
entirety.
