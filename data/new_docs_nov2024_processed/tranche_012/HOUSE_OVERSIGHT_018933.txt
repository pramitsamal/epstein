Surse him hundreds of thousands of |

dollars after their failed investment
in Texas oil wells. A judge decided
Epstein owed him nothing.

“Its a bad memory. I would
rather not have ever met J effrey
Epstein,” said Michael Stroll, the
retired former president of Williams
Electronics and Sega Corp. “Suffice
it to say I have nothing good to say
about him.”

Among the characteristics most
attributed to Epstein is a penchant
for women.

He has been linked to Maxwell,
a fixture on the high-society party
circuits in both New York and Lon-
don. Previous girlfriends are said to
include a former Ms. Sweden and a
Raia model.

“He’s a lot of fun to be with,”
Donald Trump told New York maga-
zine in 2002. “It is even said that he
likes beautiful women as much as I
do, and many of them are on the
younger side. No doubt about it,
Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

Investigation leads to Epstein

Although he was not a fre
quenter of the Palm Beach social
scene, he made his presence felt.
Among his charitable donations, he

In Palm Beach, he lived in luxu-

ry. Three black Mercedes sat in his

garage, alongside a green Harley-

Davidson. His jet waited at a hangar
at Palm Beach International Airport.
At home, a private chef and a small
staff stood at the ready. From a
window in his mansion, he could
look out on the Intracoastal Water-
way and the West Palm Beach sky-
line. He seemed to be a man who -
had everything.

In March 2005, a worried mother :

ven ' WOntacted Palm Beach police. She

said another parent had overheard a
conversation between their chil-
dren.
__ Now the mother was afraid her
14-year-old daughter had been
‘ molested by a man on the island.
The phone call triggered an
extensive investigation, one that
‘ would lead detectives to Epstein but
leave them frustrated.

Palm Beach police and the state
attorney's office have declined to
discuss the case. But a Palm Beach
police report detailing the criminal
probe offers a window into what
detectives faced as they sought to
close in on Epstein.

Detectives interviewed the girl,
who told them a friend had invited
her to arich man’s house to perform
a massage. She said the friend told
her to say she was 18 if asked. At the
house, she said she was paid $300
after stripping to her panties and
massaging the man while he mas-
turbated. ;

Police interview 5 alleged victims

The investigation began in full
after the girl identified Epstein in a
photo as the man who had paid her.
Police arranged for garbage trucks

to set aside Epstein’s trash so police -

could sift through it. They set up a
video camera to record the comings
and goings at his home. They mon-
itored an airport hangar for signs of
his private jet’s arrivals and depar-
tures.

They quickly learned that the
woman who took the 14-year-old girl
to Epstein’s house was Haley Rob-
son, a Palm Beach Community Col-
lege student from Loxahatchee. Ina
sworn statement at police head-
quarters, Robson, then 18, admitted
she had taken atleast six girls to visit
Epstein, all between the ages of 14
and 16. Epstein paid her for each
visit, she said.

During the drive back to her

house, Robson told detectives, “I’m
like a Heidi Fleiss.”

Police interviewed five alleged

victims and 17 witnesses. Their
report shows some of the girls said
they had been instructed to have sex
with another woman. in front of
Epstein, and one said she had direct
intercourse with him.

In October, police searched the |

Palm Beach mansion. They discov-
ered photos of naked, young-looking
females, just as several of the girls
had described in interviews. Hidden

cameras were found in the garage |

area and inside a clock on Epstein’s

desk, alongside a girl’s high school |

transcript.

Two of Epstein’s former
employees told investigators that
young-looking girls showed up to
perform massages two or three
times a day when Epstein was in |
town.

They said the girls were permit-
ted many indulgences. A chef
cooked for them. Workers gave
them rides and handed out hun-
dreds of dollars at a time.

One employee told detectives he
was told to send a dozen.roses to one
teenage girl after a high school :
drama performance. Others were
given rental cars. One, according to -
police, received a $200 Christmas
bonus.

The cops moved to cement their
case. But as they tried to tighten the
noose, they encountered other
forces at work.

In Orlando they interviewed a
possible victim who told them noth-
ing inappropriate had happened
between her and Epstein. They
asked her whether she had spoken

to anyone else. She said yes, a pri-

vate investigator had asked her the
same questions.

When they subpoenaed one of
Epstein’s former employees, he told
them the same thing. He and a pri- |
vate eye had met ata restaurant days
earlier to go over what the man
would tell investigators.

Detectives received complaints
that private eyes were posing as
police officers. When they told
Epstein’s local attorney, Guy Frons-
tin, he said the investigators worked |
for Roy Black, the high-powered |
Miami lawyer who has defended the |
likes of Rush Limbaugh and William
Kennedy Smith.

While the private eyes were
conducting a parallel investigation,
Dershowitz, the Harvard law pro- |
fessor, traveled to West Palm Beach
with information about the girls.
From their own profiles on the pop- .
ular Web site MySpace.com, he
obtained copies of their discussions
about their use of alcohol and mari-
juana.

He took his research to a meet-
ing with prosecutors. in early 2006,
where he sought to cast doubt on the
teens’ reliability.
