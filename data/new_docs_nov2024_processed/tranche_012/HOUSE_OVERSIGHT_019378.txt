p EPSTEIN from 1A
asking questions and teenage girls

started talking, a wave of legal
resistance followed.

Tf Palm Beach police didn’t know
quite who Jeffrey Epstein was, they
found out soon enough.

Epstein, now 53, was a quintes-
sential man of mystery. He amassed
his fortune and friends quietly,
always in the background as he
navigated New York high society.

When he first attracted notice in
the early 1990s, it was on account of
the woman he was dating: Ghislaine
Maxwell, daughter of the late British
media tycoon Robert Maxwell.

In a lengthy article, headlined
*The Mystery of Ghislaine Max-
well’s Secret Love,” the British Mail
on Sunday tabloid laid out specula-
tive stories that the socialite’s beau
was a CIA spook, a math teacher, a
concert pianist or a corporate head-
hunter.

“But what is the truth about
him?” the newspaper wondered.
“Like Maxwell, Epstein is both
flamboyant and intensely private.”

The media frenzy did not begin
in full until a decade later. In Sep-
tember 2002, Epstein was flung into
the limelight when he flew Clinton
and actors Kevin Spacey and Chris
Tucker to Africa on his private jet.

Suddenly everyone wanted to
know who Epstein was. New York
magazine and Vanity Fair published
lengthy profiles. The New York Post
listed him as one of the city’s most
eligible bachelors and began
describing him in its gossip columns
with adjectives such as “mysterious”
and “reclusive.”

Although Epstein gave no inter-
views, the broad strokes of his past
started to come into focus,

Building a life of extravagance

He was born blue-collar in 1953,
the son of a New York City parks
department employee, and raised in
Brookiyn’s Coney Island neighbor-
hood. He left college without a
bachelor’s degree but became a
math teacher at the prestigious
Dalton School in Manhattan.

The story goes that the father of
one of Epstein’s students was so
impressed with the man that he put
him in touch with a senior partner at
Bear Stearns, the global investment
bank and securities firm.

In 1976, Epstein left Dalton for a
job at Bear Stearns. By the early
1980s, he had started J. Epstein and
Co. That is when he began making
his millions in earnest,

fron,

Little is known or said about r

Epstein’s business except this: He
manages money for the extremely

wealthy. He is said to handle .

accounts only of $1 billion or great-
er.
it has been estimated he has

. roughly 15 clients, but their identt-
- ties are the subject of only specula-

tion. All except for one: Leslie Wex-
ner, founder of The Limited retail

‘ chain and a former Palm Beacher

who is said to have been a mentor to

- Epstein.

a

Wexner sold Epstein one of his
most lavish residences: a massive
townhouse that dominates a block
on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It
is reported to have, among its finer
features, closed-circuit television
and a heated sidewalk to melt away
fallen snow.

That townhouse, thought to be
the largest private residence in
Manhattan, is only a piece of the
extravagant world Epstein built over
time.

In New Mexico, he constructed a
27,000-square-foot hilltop mansion
onai0,000-acre ranch outside Santa
Fe. Many believed itto be the largest
home in the state.

In Palm Beach, he bought a
waterfront home on Ei Brillo Way.
And he owns a 100-acre private
island in the Virgin Islands.

Perhaps as remarkable as his
Javish homes is his extensive net-
work of friends and associates at the
highest echelons of power. This
includes not only socialites but also
business tycoons, media moguls,
politicians, royalty and Nobel Prize-
winning scientists whose research

‘ he often funds.

“Just like other people collect
art, he collects scientists,” said
Martin Nowak, who directs the
Program for Evolutionary Dynamics
at Harvard University and was

reportedly the recipient of a $30 °
million research donation from ,

Epstein.

Epstein is said to have
befriended former Harvard Presi-
dent Larry Summers, prominent law

| Professor Alan Dershowitz, Donald
* Trump and New York Daily News
; Publisher Mort Zuckerman.

And yét he managed for decades |

to maintain a low profile. He avoids

* eating out and was rarely photo-
| graphed.

“The odd thing is I never met
him,” said Dominick Dunne, the
famous chronicler of the trials and
tribulations of the very rich. “I wasn’t
even aware of him,” except fora
Vanity Fair article.

Epstein’s friendship with Clinton
has attracted the most attention.

Epstein met Clinton as early as
1995, when he paid tens of thou-
sands of dollars to join him at an
intimate fund-raising dinner in Palm
Beach. But from all appearances,
they did not become close friends
until after Clinton left the Oval Office
and moved to New York.

Epstein has donated more than
$100,000 to Democratic candidates’
campaigns, incliding John Kerry’s
presidential bid, the reelection
campaign of New Mexico Gov, Bill
Richardson and the Senate bids of
Joe Lieberman, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Christopher Dodd and
Charles Schumer.

Powerful friends and enemies

A Vanity Fair profile found
cracks in the veneer of Epstein’s life
story. The 2003 article said he left
Bear Stearns in the wake of a federal
probe and a possible Securities and
Exchange Commission violation. It
also pointed out that Citibank once
sued him for defaulting on a $20
million loan.

The article suggested that one of
his business mentors and previous
employers was Steven Hoffenberg,
now serving a prison term after
“bilking investors out of more than
$450 million in one of the largest
Ponzi schemes in American histo-

ry. |

As he amassed his wealth,
Epstein made enemies in disputes
both large and small. He sued the
man who in 1990 sold him his
multimillion-dollar Palm Beach
home over a dispute about less than
$%6,000 in furnishings.
