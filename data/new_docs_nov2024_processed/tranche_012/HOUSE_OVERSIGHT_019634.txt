multibillion-dollar enterprise of outsourcing the management of the
NSA’s computer networks and other technical work to outside con-
tractors. It also casts doubts on the post-9/11 decision by the intel-
ligence community to strip away much of the NSA’s “stovepiping”
that previously insulated its most sensitive computers. Without
such stovepiping, any rogue civilian employee could bring down the
entire edifice of shared intelligence.

A finding that Snowden had acted in concert with others in breach-
ing compartments at the NSA would hardly be any more reassuring.
Such collaboration among intelligence workers would reflect gravely
on the mind-set of the NSA. Snowden described an atmosphere in
which intelligence workers exchanged lewd photographs of foreign
suspects. Some NSA employees met to protest the NSA policies. Did
this violation of the NSA‘s rules also involve abetting the theft of
documents? If so, the NSA would have to evaluate further vulner-
abilities that might arise when it entrusts its secrets to technicians
who do not share its values. A collaborative breach would signal an
immense failure of the present concept of the counterintelligence

ment’s intelligence secrets. However it was organized, it was clear
that Snowden had played a major role in what amounted to a bril-
liant intelligence coup.
