legislation. The chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence & Security,
Andrew Hastie, named one of Australia’s most generous political donors as a “co-
conspirator” in a UN bribery investigation and linked the affair to covert interference.
“In Australia it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party is working to covertly
interfere with our media and universities and also to influence our political processes
and public debates,” Hastie told his committee, after receiving support from the deputy
chair, Anthony Byrne. “And it’s time we applied sunlight to our political system and a
person who has featured prominently in Australian politics over the past decade,.”™

The counter-interference criminal legislation and the foreign influence transparency
scheme both passed through Parliament on June 28. The Home Affairs legislation had
passed through Parliament earlier in the year, with the counter-foreign-interference
task force established in April 2018. This effectively elevated the importance of
countering foreign interference to a similar status as countering terrorism.” At the time
of writing, the legislation to ban foreign political donations has not passed through
Parliament. And Turnbull himself has been replaced as prime minister. The new prime
minister, Scott Morrison, appears to have opted for policy continuity.

The Turnbull government led the way in diagnosing the challenge, forging an internal
consensus, and setting out a bold and coherent counterstrategy. Australia became the
first country in the world to lay the foundations for a sustained and coherent counter-
interference strategy.

But if Australia is going to reset the terms of its engagement with a superpower—holding
China to its principle of noninterference and setting a precedent of sovereign equality
that others might follow—then it will have to accept strains on the bilateral relationship.
If the government is to successfully implement a transformational strategy to defend
Australia’s democratic processes and social cohesion, then it has to find politically
sustainable ways of engaging the democratic process and publicly making the case.
