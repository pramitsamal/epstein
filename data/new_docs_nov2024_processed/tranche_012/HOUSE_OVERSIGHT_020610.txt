10 The debate in Australia has evolved considerably since 2009, when Prime Minister Kevin Rudd proposed
campaign finance reform legislation that would have rendered foreign-sourced political donations illegal,
and Turnbull (as opposition leader in parliament) declined to support the legislation. Rudd has argued that
this legislation would have mitigated some of the more problematic behaviors regarding foreign influence
that have since occurred. Others, however, maintain that the ban would not have stopped the bulk of
CCP-backed donations, which are channeled through Australian residents and citizens, and that the more
important reform was to ensure greater transparency in identifying foreign agents. For Rudd’s critique, see

CANADA

Canada has a long history of engagement with the PRC dating back to 1970.
Substantial and rapidly expanding connections with China at multiple levels include
human flows (migrants, tourists, students), trade (with a major and recurring
imbalance in China’s favor), and diplomatic interactions. There are roughly

160,000 PRC students in Canadian schools, about 70 percent of them in universities
and colleges. Per capita, this is about three times as large as in the United States and
roughly on par with Australia.

Canadian experiences with Chinese interference are less intense than those documented
in Australia and New Zealand. As early as 1997, a leaked report by Canada’s RCMP-SIS
