An Observation from Ben Bernanke,

Current Chairman of the Federal Reserve

A famous economist once said anything that can’t go on
forever will eventually stop, and this [government liabilities
from entitlement programs] will stop, but it might stop in a
very unpleasant way in terms of sharp cuts, a financial crisis,
high interest rates that stop growth, continued borrowing
from abroad. So, clearly we need to get control of this over
the medium term, and specifically we’re going to have to
look at entitlements because that’s a very big part of the
obligations of the federal government going forward.

-- Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve

Testimony before House Budget Committee, June 9, 2010
