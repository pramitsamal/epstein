— Another woman filed a
federal lawsuit against Jef-
frey Epstein on Wednesday,
‘alleging that he turned a
massage she gave him at his
Palm Beach mansion into a
sexual episode when she was
16 years old.

Identified as “Jane Doe
No. 3,” she is seeking more
than $50 million, the same
as two other “Jane Does” who
filed similar lawsuits in the
past six weeks, All three suits
were filed by Miami lawyer
Jeffrey Herman. .

Herman subsequently
“withdrew the first Jane Doe’s.
lawsuit because of squabbling
by her parents over the litiga-
tion. The girl may refile the
suit after she turns 18 in May
and can make her own deci-
sions, Herman said.

Other alleged victims also
have contacted him, Herman
, ' said. “I do anticipate more

cases,” he:said.

In the latest litigation, Jane

Doe No. 3 alleges that she

was recruited by a former col-

lege student, Haley Robson,
to give Epstein a massage for
money at his waterfront home

late in 2004 or early in 2005.

The lawsuit alleges that,
while on the massage table,

Epstein sexually touched

Jane Doe No. 3, then mas-

turbated. She is suing on

grounds of sexual assault and
intentional infliction of emo-

tional distress.

“She felt intimidated. She
felt scared,” Herman said.
Jarie Doe No. 3-made only the
one visit to Epstein’s home,
he said.

“Its just another copycat
lawsuit filed by the same
lawyer who appears less
interested in the truth than
in grandstanding with these
press conferences,” said Jack
Goldberger, one of Epstein’s
attorneys. “We now have
sworn testimony that girls
lied about their age to Jeffrey
Epstein, and they were care-

ful in being convincing that.

they were over the age of 18.”
Herman said Robson
instructed Jane Doe No. 3,
“When he asks how old you
are, tell him 18 or 19 years
old.” But he said it doesn’t
matter. “They were underage
girls,” Herman said. “They
were sexually assaulted.”

In addition to the civil law-
suits, Epstein was indicted
on a single count of felony
solicitation of prostitution
in July 2006 after a lengthy
Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment investigation into his
activities with underage girls
at his home. A resolution has
been delayed continually. The
case is on Monday's court
docket but is expected to be

_ rescheduled once again.

“One of the reasons (Jane
Doe No. 3) came forward is
she is tired of waiting for jus-
tice,” Hérman said.
