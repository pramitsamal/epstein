Prostitution Ring Leader Sentenced To 21 Months

November 11, 2001 | Staff report

Aman extradited from Germany has been sentenced to 21 months in prison
and fined $6,000 for recruiting Czech women to a prostitution ring with
promises of modeling work.

Ronald Eppinger had faced up to 10 years after pleading guilty this month to
charges of alien smuggling for prostitution, interstate travel for prostitution and
money laundering.

Eppinger worked with two Czech women to get tourist visas for the future rs
prostitutes and kept nearly half of their earnings from operations in Miami, New wv FRI Tenn

York, Texas and the Bahamas, prosecutors said. Women were brought to the United States illegally from 1997 to 1999.

As part of his plea, Eppinger forfeited a boat and limousine used to promote the call-girl service.

Eppinger learned he was under investigation in June 1999 and moved from the United States to the Czech capital of Prague.

He was arrested in Germany last December while traveling from the Czech Republic to Spain and was sent to the United
States in May.
