answer questions about the names of the girls that he
was sexually trafficking. And that's one of the things
that has made this case so difficult, because if we
could get the names of those girls, then we could -- we
could try to help them.

We could -- we could start to unravel the
many crimes that Mr. Epstein has committed along with
his associates. So, again, I could go on longer, and I
don't want to filibuster your time, I think I've seen
illustrations of that recently, but I -- what I want to
do is make sure that -- that I could give additional
information if people like Mr. Epstein would cooperate
and give me the names of the girls that he was sexually
trafficking.

MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike the

nonresponsive portion of the answer.

Can I have the same standing objection,

Mr. Scarola?

MR. SCAROLA: No, I don't think -- I don't

think you will need a standing objection.

MR. SIMPSON: Well, I'll just make the

objection there and --

MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.

MR. SIMPSON: I will go back to my question.
