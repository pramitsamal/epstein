had asked him, hey, what do you Know about Jeffrey
Epstein? And, again, off the top of my head, you want
to know what I can remember right now.

What I can remember right now is that in the
Vanity Fair article, the -- in the Vanity Fair article,
Mr. Dershowitz said, I've written 20-some odd books.
There's only one person outside my immediate family with
whom I share drafts and that's Jeffrey Epstein.

So I took that as indicating a very close
personal association that, you Know, among the people
that obviously he's sharing these kinds of things that
he wants evaluated before he shares them with the
broader world. There's his immediate family and then
there's Jeffrey Epstein.

There was also another similar quote in the
article that indicated that -- that Mr. Dershowitz said
that he wasn't interested in Epstein just because he has
a lot of money. I mean, Epstein was identified as a
billionaire -- billionaire with a B, so the record is
clear.

But he said, look, if Epstein wants all his
money, and I'm paraphrasing here, I will be happy to
walk down, you know, the Coney Island Boardwalk with him
and discuss things with him, even if he didn't have any

money .
