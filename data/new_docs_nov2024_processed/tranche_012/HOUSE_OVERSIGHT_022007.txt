he Palm Beach County Main Detention Center is on the
west side of Lake Worth Lagoon, which separates West
3 Palm Beach from the island of Palm Beach. Epstein’s

home on El Brillo Way is five miles to the east. Mary’s high

 school is several miles to the west.
It's fitting, somehow, that this jail—which is the jail Epstein
'ends up in, after turning himself in to the local sheriff—lies in
7 between the two points.
The detention center’s inmates, their families, and their law-
ers call it the Gun Club, a reference not only to the jail’s address,
on Gun Club Road, but also to its population of hustlers, bur-
glars, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers. There’s the occa-
sional hooker as well. And, from time to time, Haitian refugees
fe lodged there.
There are three thousand inmates in all.
