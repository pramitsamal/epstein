How a “Cascading GRAT” strategy works

G) Grantor transfers asset(s) to an irrevocable
trust. Grantor may manage GRAT assets as
trustee.

@) Grantor pays little or no gift tax, or uses
gift tax exemption*, on present value of
trust remainder**

Annuity payments from existing GRATs
fund a new GRAT

Grantor pays tax on ordinary income and
realized gain earned by the trust (but not
on annuity amount transferred from trust
to grantor)

©; When trust term ends, remaining trust
assets pass to beneficiaries free of gift tax
if grantor does not survive the term,
trust assets are included
in the estate and subject to
estate tax

If necessary, grantor pays gift tax or
uses gift tax exemption on transfer

*Gift tax exemption in 2012 shelters up to $5,120,000 per individual of value transferred from gift tax.
**Calculation based on Treasury discount rate in effect at time of funding GRAT. A recent Tax Court decision (Walton v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. No. 41 (Dec. 22, 2000))

allows GRAT to be “zeroed out,” eliminating the need to incur any gift tax.
