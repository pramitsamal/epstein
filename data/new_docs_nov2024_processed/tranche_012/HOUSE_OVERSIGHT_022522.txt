As this language makes clear, the FCPA broadly
applies to corrupt payments to “any” officer or employee
of a foreign government and to those acting on the for-
eign government's behalf.!? The FCPA thus covers cor-
rupt payments to low-ranking employees and high-level
officials alike.!*

The FCPA prohibits payments to foreign officials, not
to foreign governments.'> That said, companies contem-
plating contributions or donations to foreign governments
should take steps to ensure that no monies are used for cor-
rupt purposes, such as the personal benefit of individual
foreign officials.

Department, Agency, or Instrumentality of a
Foreign Government

Foreign officials under the FCPA include officers
or employees of a department, agency, or instrumental-
ity of a foreign government. When a foreign government
is organized in a fashion similar to the US. system, what
constitutes a government department or agency is typically
clear (e.g., a ministry of energy, national security agency, or
transportation authority).!!* However, governments can be
organized in very different ways.'!” Many operate through
state-owned. and state-controlled entities, particularly in
such areas as aerospace and defense manufacturing, bank-
ing and finance, healthcare and life sciences, energy and
extractive industries, telecommunications, and transporta-
tion.'!® By including officers or employees of agencies and
instrumentalities within the definition of “foreign official,”
the FCPA accounts for this variability.

The term “instrumentality” is broad and can include
state-owned or state-controlled entities. Whether a particu-
lar entity constitutes an “instrumentality” under the FCPA
requires a fact-specific analysis of an entity’s ownership,
control, status, and function.!? A number of courts have

approved final jury instructions providing a non-exclusive

The FCPA:

Anti-Bribery Provisions

list of factors to be considered:

e the foreign state’s extent of ownership of the entity;

e the foreign state’s degree of control over the entity
(including whether key officers and directors of
the entity are, or are appointed by, government
officials);

e the foreign state’s characterization of the entity and
its employees;

e the circumstances surrounding the entity's creation;

e the purpose of the entity’s activities;

e the entity’s obligations and privileges under the
foreign state’s law;

e the exclusive or controlling power vested in the
entity to administer its designated functions;

e the level of financial support by the foreign
state (including subsidies, special tax treatment,
government-mandated fees, and loans);

e the entity's provision of services to the jurisdiction’s
residents;

e whether the governmental end or purpose sought
to be achieved is expressed in the policies of the
foreign government; and

e the general perception that the entity is performing
official or governmental functions.'”°

Companies should consider these factors when eval-
uating the risk of FCPA violations and designing compli-
ance programs.

DOJ and SEC have pursued cases involving instru-
mentalities since the time of the FCPA’s enactment and
have long used an analysis of ownership, control, status,
and function to determine whether a particular entity is
an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government.
For example, the second-ever FCPA case charged by DOJ
involved a California company that paid bribes through a

Mexican corporation to two executives of a state-owned
