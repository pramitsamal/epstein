under 18 U.S.C. § 371. For conspiracy offenses, the govern-
ment generally need prove only that one act in furtherance
of the conspiracy occurred during the limitations period,
thus enabling the government to prosecute bribes paid or
accounting violations occurring more than five years prior
to the filing of formal charges.”

There are at least two ways in which the applicable
limitations period is commonly extended. First, compa-
nies or individuals cooperating with DOJ may enter into
a tolling agreement that voluntarily extends the limitations
period. Second, under 18 US.C. § 3292, the government
may seek a court order suspending the statute of limitations
posed in a criminal case for up to three years in order to
obtain evidence from foreign countries. Generally, the sus-
pension period begins when the official request is made by
the US. government to the foreign authority and ends on
the date on which the foreign authority takes final action

on the request.”

Statute of Limitations in Civil Actions

In civil cases brought by SEC, the statute of limita-
tions is set by 28 U.S.C. § 2462, which provides for a five-
year limitation on any “suit or proceeding for the enforce-
ment of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture.” The five-year
period begins to run “when the claim first accrued.” The
five-year limitations period applies to SEC actions seek-
ing civil penalties, but it does not prevent SEC from
seeking equitable remedies, such as an injunction or the
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, for conduct pre-dating
the five-year period. In cases against individuals who are
not residents of the United States, the statute is tolled for
any period when the defendants are not “found within the
United States in order that proper service may be made
thereon.”*!° Furthermore, companies or individuals coop-
erating with SEC may enter into tolling agreements that

voluntarily extend the limitations period.
