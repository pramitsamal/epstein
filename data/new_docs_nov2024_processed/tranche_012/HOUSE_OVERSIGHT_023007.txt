The Marriott hotel in West Palm Beach, at 1001 Okeechobee Blvd., is where U.S.
Attorney Alexander Acosta met with Jeffrey Epstein’s attorney to work out a plea
arrangement. Emily Michot emichot@miamiherald.com

November: Epstein’s lawyers object to an addendum to the agreement. The
provision called for a special master to appoint an attorney to represent Epstein
victims’ rights to civil compensation.

December: The two sides continue to debate the addendum. Epstein attorney
Kenneth Starr asks for a review of the agreement by the U.S. Department of Justice
in Washington, further delaying its execution. Victims are told the investigation is
continuing.

2008

January: Epstein attorney, Lefkowitz, calls Acosta, telling him his client will not go
through with the agreement because it requires him to register as a sex offender.

February: With the plea negotiations and the Justice Department review still in
limbo, the FBI continues its probe, locating more witnesses and evidence.

March: Preparations are made for a new federal grand jury presentation. In court
documents, the U.S. Attorney’s Office notes that Epstein’s victims are being
harassed by his lawyers, who are not specifically named.
