Both these components of variance convexity suggest that
long-dated ESTX50 tails (e.g., VarSwaps or far OTM puts} are
historically cheap vs. ATMF vol.

variance strike = ATMf vol squared x (1 +3 x T x skew squared), where T is time to maturity and skew
= [implied vol at strike 90 - implied vol at strike 100 ]/[ 90 - 100]. For more details see Derman’s

D he Tel has run fi ickly; hedge using a Sep17 +17P/-18C collar

BofAML equity telecom analysts have reiterated their recommendation to be cautious
on Deutsche Tel as the company may face regulatory hurdles in their T-Mobile merger.
Given the stock has outperformed European telcos (SXKP} by 15.1% over the past 1
year, investors who own the stock should consider hedging downside with a long DTE
GY Sep17 17 put, short DTE GY Sep17 18 call for 0.46%, in our view. Indeed, spending
0.46% to protect gains is attractive as the price of the structure has rarely been cheaper
(only 14% of the time since Jun-08, Chart 29). Moreover, Chart 30 illustrates that this
structure enables stock owners to protect from losses greater than 2.1% while retaining
3.6% upside potential if the stock rises to 18 (near its 15-year high) by the Sep expiry.
