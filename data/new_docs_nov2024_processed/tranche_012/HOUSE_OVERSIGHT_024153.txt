Japanese equities

Topix (27 June): 745 (last month: 721)
UBS View Topix (6-month target): 780
¢ We expect earnings growth of about 45% over the coming 12 months. This exceptional high growth is
mainly due to the two natural disasters last year, as well as tax regulation changes which caused a
number of one-time losses to be booked in the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.
e In our base case scenario, we see only limited scope for an additional earnings boost from the local
economic recovery, given the slowing in export markets. Japanese companies are expected to continue
their cost reduction efforts to counter the impact of a strong yen.
¢ The Japanese government has started implementing its JPY 18tn recovery budget in 4Q 2011, and we
expect the budget to boost Japanese GDP by 1-1.5% in FY2012.
e Mainly due to the earnings rebound, we expect the TOPIX trailing P/E to drop from around 16.5x to 14x
— 14.5x by year end; still the earnings rebound should provide some room for moderate price increases.

4 Positive scenario Topix (6-month target): 900
¢ Stronger global demand and stabilizing European markets provide an additional boost to earnings, and
also lead to improved risk taking. Falling risk aversion is likely to lead to a weaker yen, providing further
upside to earnings. TOPIX target is based on 16.0x trailing P/E.

& Negative scenario Topix (6-month target): 600
¢ Faltering global growth leads to weak exports, triggering negative earnings surprises. A strengthening
USDJPY below 75 in response to rising risk aversion might provide an additional drag on the economy and
earnings. We would then expect the P/E ratio to contract to 13.5x, even if earnings show no recovery.

What we're watching Why it matters

JPY and exports The exchange rate is an important factor for the Japanese equity market, and
central bank intervention is a key swing factor. Japan’s trade balance could be in
deficit and may impact USDJPY rates. Key date: 09 July, Japanese trade

balance

BoJ’s monetary policy

The Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) additional commitment to its asset purchase program,
board meeting

which is currently JPY 65tn in size, would lead to a weaker yen, in our view. Key
date: 12 July, BoJ policy meeting

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e The earthquake in Japan and recent
floods in Thailand have impacted
Japanese earnings negatively. A recovery
from these disasters should benefit auto
and industrial stocks in particular.

e We prefer companies that continue cost
reduction initiatives to maintain price
competitiveness during the period of yen
strength.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e A weaker USDJPY may drive Japanese
companies’ earnings recovery beyond a
technical recovery from natural disasters.

e Arapidly aging population and the lack
of a powerful and stable government
remain negative for the country's longer-
term economic prospects.
