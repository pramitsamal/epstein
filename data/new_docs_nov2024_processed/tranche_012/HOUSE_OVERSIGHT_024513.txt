Restructuring charges. Restructuring charges during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, were
$29.4 million. Included in the $29.4 million of non-recurring integration costs were $11.0 million of
severance costs that resulted primarily from the closure of KLC’s former corporate offices at Golden, CO.
Additional restructuring costs in 2005 were the result of consulting, temporary contract-based labor and
other charges. Restructuring charges in 2004 were $5.1 million and were related to KLC’s acquisition of
AER in May 2003.

Parallel_Organization Costs. For much of 2005 KLC was burdened with the central operations and
infrastructure of both KinderCare and KLC. KLC has defined parallel organization costs as the cost of
maintaining these duplicative corporate functions during the overhead rationalization associated with the
KinderCare acquisition. KLC believes that approximately 70% of parallel organization costs are related to
salaries. Remaining parallel organization costs are related to upkeep, maintenance and utilities at
corporate facilities. During the first month of 2006 parallel organization costs had been reduced to
$174,042 (annualized run-rate of $2.1 million) compared to an estimated $23.3 million in 2005.

Parallel organization costs for the 2004 fiscal year are estimated based on an annualized run-rate based
on the costs incurred during the first month following the KinderCare acquisition. During that month
(January 2005), KLC incurred approximately $2.3 million of parallel organization costs ($28.1 million on
an annualized run-rate basis).

Interest. Interest expense in 2004 and 2005 is almost identical because both years are pro forma for the
financings associated with the Real Estate Transaction, which refinanced the indebtedness incurred to
finance the KinderCare acquisition. In 2005 pro forma interest expense of $89.9 million includes $5.1
million of non-cash interest expense. Actual interest expense during the 2005 fiscal year was $80.7
million which did not include $32.2 million related to the early extinguishment of debt.
