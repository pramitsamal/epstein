Genetics and Propagation

Selective breeding and other botanical techniques are being used to develop cannabis varieties with
desired profiles of compounds, and scientists are developing tools to synthesize isolated cannabinoids
in laboratory settings in order to study cannabis at the genetic level. For example, the first mapping
of a cannabis genome was completed in 2011 by a team of Canadian botanists, led by Jon Page from
the National Research Council Canada and Timothy Hughes from the University of Toronto, who
sequenced 30,000 genes in a sativa variety named “Purple Kush.”

Cannabis Genome

Genetic copies, or “clones,” of cannabis plants are generally produced using two methods, “clone
clipping” and micropropagation, or “tissue culture.” Clone clipping involves cutting a growing
tip from a cannabis plant that is several inches long and inserting the cut tip into a grow-
ing medium, where it then grows into a new plant. Tissue culture involves taking a small tissue sample
(which may even be a single cell) from a plant and growing it temporarily in a sterile nutrient solu-
tion before transferring it to a permanent growing medium. Controlling cannabis plant genomes is
expected to be an important intellectual property issue in the cannabis industry (at least one U.S. pat-
ent has been issued for a strain of cannabis).
