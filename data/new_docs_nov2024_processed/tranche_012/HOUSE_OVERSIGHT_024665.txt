CHAPTER II Cannabis Science 101

Cannabis Plant Tissue Cultures

Synthetic cannabinoids and terpenes can be manufactured by modifying plant-based compounds
or through tools of synthetic biology and biocatalysis. For example, a synthetic version of THC
known as dronabinol is the active compound in the pharmaceutical product Marinol, which was
approved by the FDA in 1985 for use in treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer
chemotherapy. Methods for biosynthetic production of cannabinoids have been patented in the United
States. Some medical practitioners and cannabis users have found synthetic compounds to be less effec-
tive than plant-based cannabinoids and have attributed this reduced efficacy to the lack of an entourage
effect.

Dosage, Safety and Side Effects
Cannabis dosing schedules provided by doctors and producers generally lack scientific rigor and,
although industry participants strive to create a reliable dosing framework, users generally determine
dosage through self-titration and trial and error. (This method of dosing does not always lead to the
desired effect, but it is generally agreed that there is a low risk of death from an overdose of cannabis.)
Product packaging commonly indicates that a 10-mg serving of cannabinoids represents one dose,
and servings of 2 mg to 5 mg are commonly characterized as “microdoses.” Examples of representative
dosage amounts used to treat some common medical conditions are presented in the following table.
