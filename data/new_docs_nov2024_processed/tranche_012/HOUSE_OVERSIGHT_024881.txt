eCommerce To Be A Key Consumer Distribution Channel Long Term
(Blackledge)

2

A significant portion of the CBD products that are currently available fall into the
Personal Care / Beauty Products or Vitamins and Food Supplements verticals, both of
which are part of the larger Consumables category. Consumables continues to be a
highly under-penetrated eCommerce vertical in the midst of a progressive shift online,
and we see an opportunity for these CBD companies to expand online as secular
tailwinds continue to drive eCommerce growth for the larger Consumables market. For
context, we forecast overall US Consumables eCommerce sales of $51.BN in ’18, or 11%
eCommerce penetration, rising to $111BN in 23 or 19% eCommerce penetration.

Longer term, Consumables eCommerce market share, led by Amazon, should rise well
above our 19% penetration forecast in 23, as the sector favors eCommerce vs. Brick &
Mortar, for multiple reasons, namely (1) changing consumption trends, particularly with
younger demographics, who would prefer to “Skip the Trip” for these high
replenishment factor goods; and (2) rising smart speaker penetration, like AMZN's
popular Echo device, driving gains in high replenishment re-ordering.

Due to the aforementioned macro factors, we view eCommerce as a major potential
customer distribution channel for CBD longer term as consumers’ spending habits
continue to shift, and purchasing of Personal Care Products, Vitamins & Food
Supplements and other Consumable items moves online at an accelerated rate. We
expect growth within the Consumables (Personal Care, HH Goods, etc) and Food &
Beverage verticals to consistently outpace overall eCommerce growth '18-'23, resulting
in an increased share of U.S. eCommerce sales.
