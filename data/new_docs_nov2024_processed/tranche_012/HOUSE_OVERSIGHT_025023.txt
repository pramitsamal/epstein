This duality—desperate need for love entwined with either willful
ignorance or even nuanced hate—has underlain the Arab view of
America for a generation, unchanged even by the collapse of the
Twin Towers. But based on my recent trip across the region, a
confluence—Arab Spring and the technology that empowered it—has
provided the U.S. a new chance to push reset with a half-billion
Arabs, as long as it can shout louder than increasingly sophisticated
bunk merchants like El Aschkar.

Ask about basic political facts—al Qaeda’s responsibility for 9/11, or
the death of Osama bin Laden—and even the most educated will start
popping off inanities.

I’ve been dealing with this frustrating relationship for much of the
past decade. Shortly after 9/11, in an effort to win Arab “hearts and
minds” in the mold of the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe,
the State Department poured hundreds of millions into a new public-
diplomacy initiative, overseen by former ad executive Charlotte Beers
and then Bush communications czar Karen Hughes. In short order

Hi, sold on newsstands in 20 Arab countries, was charged with
providing a window into, and dialogue with, the U.S. for Arabs
between 18 and 35. To maximize the project’s efficacy, I conducted
perhaps the most extensive qualitative study of Arab sentiment about
America in the post-9/11 era. With two colleagues, I traveled across
the Arab world—the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon, and
Morocco—for two weeks on what we called a “listening research
tour,” interviewing scores of young Arabs individually, in focus
groups and at giant roundtables, using Hi as proxy for the region’s
perpetual question: what do you think about the U.S.? While the
