The war being waged has two components - mental and physical. The mental side is a minefield of
constructs, deeply implanted within generations of Americans, and its PC chickens are coming home to
roost. So much so, millions of Americans (westerners) cannot break free of its shackles. But it is not as if
these mental chains magically appe ared. Far from it - http://adinakutnicki.com/2012/1 1/26/the-death-of-...

In addition, the fault-lines of democracy allowed for the most retrograde forces, on this planet, to infiltrate
and penetrate the body politic- http://adinakutnicki.com/2012/09/02/the-subversio...

IF the mental and physical constraints are not immediately removed, it is a given that western civilization
will fall. Cause and effect.

And I would think one phy sical constraint is to not let them in in the first place. By & quot;them I mean
those who have allegiance to a socio-political system disguised as a religion that seeks world dominance by
man imposed methodology/effort -- unlike Judaism and Christianity properly understood. If we are to
believe, the world already has a King and does not need a Caliph.

Ground-breaking, brilliant. There are absolutely essentially lessons to be learned from this. Buy this book,
read it, study it, and lend it to your friends and colleagues. Do it.
