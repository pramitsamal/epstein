BEN KNIGHT (Second Unit Director of Photography)
Ben Knight

Ben Knight headed westward from his home in North Carolina at the age of 17 to follow his
dream of documentary work and photojournalism. For 10 years, he worked as the Photo Editor
for the Daily Planet in Telluride, Colorado. His still photography, video, and editing skills are
entirely self-taught. For years he operated the projector at the Telluride Mountainfilm, soaking
in the style of the films that showed from around the globe. In 2008 Knight stood upon the stage
at the Mountainfilm Awards to accept the Director’s Choice Award as well as Audience Choice
for Best Film for Red Gold. What a journey.

Red Gold, a feature-length documentary, is set at the headwaters of the Kvichak and the
Nushagak Rivers in Bristol Bay Alaska: the two largest remaining sockeye salmon runs on the
planet. Mining companies Northern Dynasty and Anglo American have proposed to extract what
may prove to be the richest deposit of gold and copper in the world. Red Gold is a portrait of a
unique way of life that would not exist if the salmon didn't return with Bristol Bay's tide. This
film won many awards, including Best Film, Ellensburg Film Festival, Award for Cinematic
Vision, Camden International Film Festival, Audience Choice Award for Best Film, Banff
Mountain Film Festival, and Director’s Choice for Best Film, Telluride Mountain Film
(2007/2008).
