here is my latest and final comment on Peter Richerson's comments on Gordon's idea about Trump being a
narcissistic psychopath—a view with which i firmly agree

i have learned a lot by thinking through all of Peter's argumentation but i have not learned much that
contradicts either my biases nor reality herself

all best wishes
