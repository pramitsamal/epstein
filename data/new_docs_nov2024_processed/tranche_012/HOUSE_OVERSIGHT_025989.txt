Week in review (Europe)

The FTSE100 reached 13 months highs last week as the BOE exceeded market
expectations by announcing a 25 bp rate cut (its first rate cut in 7yrs}, a further £60bn
of QE purchases (vs forecasted £50 bn) while also hinting at more potential stimulus in
the autumn. Unsurprisingly, GBPUSD fell further on the back of this. The better-than-
expected US nonfarm payrolls that beat all surveyed forecasts helped drive US markets
to new all-time closing highs also helped European equities rebound from a mid-week
trough. As a result, the V2X has retraced close to its 11 month lows as foreseeable
catalysts are behind us for a potentially quieter end to the summer.

« Long dated ESTX50 var term structure is historically elevated; vol term
structure is not: The dislocation of 3y var convexity (var strike/ATMf volatility)
vs that of ly, which in itself is near extremes, is particularly striking

- European issuance of ESTX50-linked structured products picked up in July:
We estimate issuance of ~€120Mn/day in July, which compares to €5Mn daily
issuance in June and €55Mn daily issuance in 1H16 (excluding June).

- The current vega outstanding in SX5E-linked products is €143Mnh, which is in
its 97 percentile since Jan-14 (when our records begin}. Moreover, this could
rise to as much as €169Mn if the SX5E rallied to 3280.

Long-dated ESTX50 var term structure is steep; vol term structure is not

Despite a significantly steep longer dated ESTX50 variance term structure (vs its
average since 2008), the volatility term structure is nearly flat. As a result, the level of
ESTX50 long dated variance is historically elevated vs the level of long dated vol. The
dislocation of 3y var convexity (varswap strike/ATMf vol ratio) vs 1y var convexity (which
in itself is near its historic highs) is particularly striking.

snapshot as of 5-Aug-16

Structured product Jul update: EU issuance picked up; Korean issuance lagged

We estimate issuance of ESTX50-linked structured products in Europe was
~€120Mn/day in July, much higher than the €5Mn daily issuance in June and €55Mn daily
issuance in 1H16 (excluding June). This compares to ~€20Mn daily issuance in July out of
Korea.
