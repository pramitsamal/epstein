deals in Europe aggregating ca. €390m. When benchmarked against other similar funds, the investment team
has succeeded in deploying faster and with credit spreads well above the infrastructure senior debt benchmark,
enabling BRIDGE to become a force in the growing institutions-backed infrastructure debt market. BRIDGE’s
ability to invest beyond the traditional definition of core infrastructure and to structure transactions was a key
differentiator when Edmond de Rothschild launched this platform, as part of its commitment to real economy.
BRIDGE is innovative in the sense that the investment team sources transactions directly from sponsors and is
actively involved in the structuring phase, acting as Mandated Lead Arranger.

BRIDGE comprises a large, international and skilled London based investment team of 11 investment
professionals who between them have arranged more than €100bn of landmark infrastructure deals over the
last 20 years across the globe. The BRIDGE team is among the largest within the debt funds universe and
demonstrates the Edmond de Rothschild Group’s commitment to the platform.
