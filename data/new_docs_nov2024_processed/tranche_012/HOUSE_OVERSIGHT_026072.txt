The BRIDGE platform has a long-term European investment strategy and a mandate to cover all sectors of
infrastructure, notably energy, renewables, utilities, transportation, telecommunications and_ social
infrastructure and can execute project financing, refinancing and acquisition finance transactions.

The BRIDGE platform currently comprises investments of between €20-120 million each, in 17 European
infrastructure transactions. In 2016 alone, the BRIDGE team has achieved financial close for 11 infrastructure
deals in Europe aggregating ca. €390m. When benchmarked against other similar funds, the investment team
has succeeded in deploying faster and with credit spreads well above the infrastructure senior debt
benchmark, enabling BRIDGE to become a force in the growing institutions-backed infrastructure debt market.
BRIDGE’s ability to invest beyond the traditional definition of core infrastructure and to structure transactions
was a key differentiator when Edmond de Rothschild launched this platform, as part of its commitment to real
economy. BRIDGE is innovative in the sense that the investment team sources transactions directly from
sponsors and is actively involved in the structuring phase, acting as Mandated Lead Arranger.

BRIDGE comprises a large, international and skilled London based investment team of 11 investment
professionals who between them have arranged more than €100bn of landmark infrastructure deals over the
last 20 years across the globe. The BRIDGE team is among the largest within the debt funds universe and
demonstrates the Edmond de Rothschild Group’s commitment to the platform.
