Antigua is still a very limited economy, Mendel said.

As recently as Friday, the U.S. and Antigua were still talking about settlement options, Nkenge
Harmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. government, told me in an email. And, she wrote:

...lf Antigua does proceed with the unprecedented plan for its government to authorize the theft
of intellectual property, it would only serve to hurt Antigua's own interests. Government-
authorized piracy would undermine chances for a settlement. It also would serve as a major
impediment to foreign investment in the Antiguan economy, particularly in high-tech industries.

With warm regards,

Cecile
