Venezuela: The spiral widens and intensifies... but
there is some good news

- The Venezuelan legislative elections are only one month away (December
6') and the country continues to be wracked by dysfunction, corruption and
shortages of food, toilet paper, medicines, etc.

- The government has also banned a number of leading opposition figures
from running for office and/or has placed them under house arrest.

- Inthe first half of 2105, their were reports of 132 lootings of stores and 2,800
protests”*.

- Inflation is now estimated at over 800 percent, making it the highest in the
world.

- Meanwhile, President Maduro has revived old border disputes with Guyana
and closed the border with Columbia, causing significant social unrest.

- So whatis the good news? There is a new and serious dialogue underway
between the United States and Venezuela. Multiple high-level diplomatic
visits have been undertaken in the last six months. A by-product of the US-
Cuba rapprochement?
