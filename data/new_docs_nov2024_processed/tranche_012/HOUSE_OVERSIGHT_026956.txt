= Total costs of the war on terror for the US (including wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria), are estimated to be $5.9 trillion.

= Over 40% of Americans think the US is spending the right amount on national defense, the highest level in 15 years, but
would there be appetite for yet another costly military incursion into the Middle East?

*Costs of military operations only. Iraq & Afghanistan costs based on all overseas contingency operations as of 2018; all other estimates based on 2010 CRS report scaled by US CPI

through 2018. **Deaths: Battle and other in the theater.
