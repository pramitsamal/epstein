is still years from completing an efficient enrichment infrastructure,
constructing a nuclear arsenal and developing a reliable means of delivery.
By agreeing to a compressed timeline, the U.S. only narrows its options
and makes a solution even more elusive.

As the United States again contemplates its Iran conundrum, it should
eschew calls for a take-it-or-leave-it deal. The history of Iran's
confrontation with the international community suggests that keeping it a
crisis situation benefits the Islamic Republic. Ironically, it is the Western
powers that have generated alarmist conditions. And then to escape the
predicament of their own making, they offer Iran more concessions and
further incentives.

To avoid a repeat of that outcome, it would be prudent to have a sense of
proportionality and appreciate that, in the end, time works best for the
United States and not the economically beleaguered theocracy.
