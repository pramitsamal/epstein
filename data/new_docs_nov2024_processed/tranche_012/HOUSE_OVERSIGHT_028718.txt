side of the showroom and see the city being
built, and reality starts sinking in.

It's a type of living closely associated with
the Palestinians’ neighbors in Israel. They
know very well that just a 20-minute drive
away, there's a community with a much
higher standard of living. And that
community happened to be one
representing the occupier, quote-unquote
the 'enemy.'’ But they would love to live
like that. And that's why when they come
to Rawabi some of them don't believe this
is for them initially. The first thing that
goes through their mind is that this could
be for the Israelis.

But it is for them. Rawabi's significance
could lie in something more mundane than
basic issues of sovereignty and control in
the West Bank. It lies in the common,
human desire -- powerful on either side of
the Green Line -- for a comfortable and
dignified existence.

In some quarters, this idea of working
within the present and less-than-ideal
political and economic framework to
achieve this goal is nothing short of
inflammatory. The U.S.-based, anti-peace
process website Electronic Intifada has
smeared Masri as an Israeli collaborator,
and there have been scattered accusations
that the project actually legitimizes Israeli
control over the West Bank.
