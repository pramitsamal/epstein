As for the sanctions, they may hurt ordinary Iranians but this regime is
famously indifferent to the suffering of its own people. The Ayatollah also
doesn't seem to take the Administration's talk about all options being on
the table seriously. Mr. Obama's nomination of Iran dove Chuck Hagel to
be Secretary of Defense reinforces that impression, as do reports that the
White House blocked Pentagon and CIA plans to arm the opposition that's
fighting to overthrow Iran's client regime in Damascus. An America that
won't help proxies in a proxy war isn't likely to take the fight directly to
Iran's nuclear facilities.

In rejecting Mr. Biden's offer, the Ayatollah said frankly, I'm not a
diplomat; I'm a revolutionary. Another round of multilateral talks with
Iran is set to resume this month, but maybe Joe Biden and his boss should
start taking no for an answer.

Let's face it: Obama's Iran policy ts failing

James Traub

February 8, 2013 -- There is no better example of an Obama
administration initiative that has succeeded on its own terms, and yet
failed as policy, than Iran. By engaging the regime in Tehran, and being
rebuffed, the White House has been able to enlist China, Russia, and the
European Union in imposing tough sanctions on Iran. By steadily
ratcheting up those sanctions, the administration has been able to
gradually squeeze the Iranian economy. By insisting that containment is
not an option, Obama has persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that he need not launch an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities --
at least not any time soon.
