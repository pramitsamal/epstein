footage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the WGBH episodes, and so this

funding will make all the rest possible.

I can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think I have wrong.

And I can attach a draft budget based on real Harvard numbers (what my Harvard video editor, producer,
media manager cost) as well as a draft WGBH budget I'll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at

a second stage.

Let me know what you think? And when are we reading Whitman together. Why don't we set a date for Feb
when Poetry in America 3: Whitman is running online and we could screen a little video and then have a

discussion around your table with you and some friends?
