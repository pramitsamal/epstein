weak, and there will be no second
opportunity for those who don't defend
themselves. Every year, new threats
arise. And the old ones: Hezbollah, Iran,
terrorism —are all alive and kicking and
erowing even stronger.

But there is good news too. Israel is the
strongest country in the region, from
Tripoli in Libya to Tehran. It's the
strongest militarily, strategically, and
economically, and if we know act
wisely—diplomatically too. Equally
important: Israel will continue to be the
strongest country in the region in the
foreseeable future — especially if we
manage to identify and cultivate these
sources of empowerment and advantage
— including:

¢ Armed Forces capable of defeating
any outside combination of threats,
including terrorism.

e A strong and growing economy in
an open relationship with global
markets.
