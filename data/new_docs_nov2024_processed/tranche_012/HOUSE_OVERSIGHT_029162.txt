IF THIS IS TRUE—THAT “HUMAN COOPERATION AMONG KIN” and also AMONG
“CLOSE ASSOCIATES”—“MAY REQUIRE ENFORCEMENT OF NORMS BY THIRD
PARTIES”, THEN I HAVE WASTED 40 YEARS OF MY LIFE ON THESE TOPICS.

THE MORE GENERAL PROBLEM WITH PETER’S BIAS IS THAT SO LITTLE OF
INTEREST HAS EMERGED FROM CULTURAL ARGUMENTATION. CONTRAST
GENETIC. FOR EXAMPLE, WE NOW KNOW THAT WHEN MATERNAL
GRANDMOTHERS INVEST IN THEIR CHILDREN’S CHILDREN, BOTH
GRANDDAUGHTERS AND GRANDSONS BENEFIT, WHILE WHEN PATERNAL
GRANDMOTHERS DO THE INVESTING, GRANDDAUGHTERS BENEFIT WHILE
GRANDSONS ARE HARMED. THIS WAS PREDICTED BASED ON THE DIFFERENT
WAY IN WHICH THE GRANDMOTHER'S X CHROMOSOME IS INHERITED IN THE
TWO SYSTEMS. NO “CULTURAL” ARGUMENTATION HAS COME ANYWHERE CLOSE.

OR TAKE THE LOGIC OF SO-CALLED HONOUR KILLINGS, WHICH I HAVE NOW
WORKED ON INTENSIVELY FOR TWO YEARS. NOTHING OF USE FROM CULTURAL
“THEORY” BUT A POWERFUL ARGUMENT BASED ON THE EFFECTS OF REPEATED
FIRST COUSIN MARRIAGES IN MUSLIM SOCIETIES—AND IN HINDU SOCIETIES
ENDOGAMOUS CASTES IN COMPETITION WITH EACH OTHER. See my talk in
