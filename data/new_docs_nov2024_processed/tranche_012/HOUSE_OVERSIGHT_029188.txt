Hi Lawrence,
| think we take Journey to the Beginning of Time.

Could you write two sentences for my colleague to
make clear where your talk will go for..

This may well lay the groundwork for next year’s major focus
on ORIGINES.

| do look forward to having you here again!
As ever Jakob

P.S I'll cc Michael!
