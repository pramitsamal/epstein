from one-offs to a deal flow. The zero
returns for savers from U.S. monetary
policy can make infrastructure
investments attractive.

In addition to offering financing, the
private sector can improve the design,
operation and maintenance of
infrastructure. As the state of Indiana has
shown, the federal government could

for its infrastructure, too.

The administration has talked about some
of these topics. But it is oddly passive, as

carve out an international economic
strategy, the new secretary of the
Treasury needs to choreograph policies
across all U.S. departments and with
multilateral economic institutions. The
U.S. had better wake up: International
economic strategy is the new foreign
policy.

Mr. Zoellick has served as president of
the World Bank Group, U.S. trade

Center at Harvard and the Peterson
Institute for International Economics.
