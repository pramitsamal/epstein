New paradigm in Palestine

Mahmoud Musa and Awni Sarrif

30 June - 6 July 2011 -- All roads to a meaningful settlement of the
Arab Israeli conflict are at a dead end. Nevertheless, should two
states be established in historic Palestine, bloody conflict will persist.
Putting aside disputes over natural resources, Israel will remain a
Zionist supremacist state with a clear arsenal that can turn the entire
Middle East into an inferno, and the enclaved improvised Palestinian
Arab entity cannot exist without aid from the outside world. There
will be democracy for the Jewish people of Israel, with second and
perhaps third class citizenships for all others.

The Palestinians, as the last twenty years have shown, will be ruled
under an autocratic corrupt police state. The plight of the Palestinian
refugees living outside the new Palestine will continue and their right
to return totally forgotten. The Jordanian regime may collapse to
become the alternate home leading to civil wars between the
indigenous Jordanians and the Palestinians. It is also reasonable to
assume that, in order to preserve the Jewish identity of Israel, another
Nakba will befall the Israeli Arabs who may be relocated to areas in
the West Bank.

There can only be one solution -- one state where Palestinians and
Israelis alike are equal citizens in a nation that belongs indeed to the
Middle East. Three conditions must be met for the new state to take
hold: dissolving the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Hamas
Government in Gaza, the rejection of Zionism by the Israelis, and the
return of the Palestinian refugees. These can only be accomplished
under the auspices of the United Nations (UN).
