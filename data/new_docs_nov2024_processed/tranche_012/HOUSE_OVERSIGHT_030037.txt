Obama failing as commander in chief

Robert D. Blackwill

March 28, 2011 -- The Obama administration deserves credit for its
foreign policy achievements.

There has been no successful terrorist attack on U.S. soil. President
Barack Obama and his colleagues have, thus far, skillfully handled
the popular eruptions in Tunisia and Egypt — though those crises are
far from over. They strengthened sanctions against Iran regarding its
nuclear weapons program; reset U.S.-Russia relations and completed
the New START Treaty. They have begun to deal effectively with the
rise of Chinese power; continued, after a slow start, the
transformation of U.S.-India relations, and signed a bilateral trade
accord with South Korea. They also modernized the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization with summit agreements on a new strategic
concept and ballistic missile defense.

But the administration’s record of failure is equally as long. It has not
seriously tackled our deficit and debt problem, the single greatest
threat to long-term U.S. power and influence. It is now mishandling
relations with the Gulf Arab monarchs and made a mess of the
Middle East peace process. It has allowed the U.S.-Turkey
relationship to reach historic lows, just as Turkey is becoming a
formidable actor in the Greater Middle East.

By concentrating on health care for its first two years, the
administration, and the large majorities in Congress, missed a crucial
opportunity to pass climate change legislation. With the Democratic
party’s internal constituencies, there also has been almost no
movement on international trade.
