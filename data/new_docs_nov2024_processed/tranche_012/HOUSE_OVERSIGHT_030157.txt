Avoiding a summer of blood

David Ignatius

June 22 -- “Peace is at hand,” Henry Kissinger famously announced
in October 1972 after a seeming breakthrough in Vietnam
negotiations. But it wasn’t at hand. It took three more months to
complete the Paris Peace Accords, which collapsed in 1975 when
North Vietnam overran Saigon.

This Vietnam history is a caution against premature optimism about
diplomatic solutions to deeply embedded conflicts, such as the one in
Afghanistan. But the fact remains, as is so often stated, that there is
no military solution to such conflicts. The challenge is creating a
dialogue among people who profoundly mistrust each other — and
averting a pell-mell civil war.

President Obama is embracing the logic of a political settlement for
Afghanistan with his speech Wednesday night. With Osama bin
Laden dead, Obama can claim that America’s core mission of
combating al-Qaeda is succeeding. He can bring some troops home
and step up diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban to reach a broad
peace deal by 2014.

Obama’s strategy for the Afghanistan negotiations highlights two
factors that could also be relevant in the increasingly messy conflicts
in Libya and Syria. First, the dialogue must be sponsored by people
inside the country that’s facing internal strife. The United States may
encourage contacts, but the process has to be “Afghan-led,” or
“Libyan-led,” or “Syrian-led.” Second, this dialogue requires a
regional framework, so that the combatants don’t turn to meddling
neighbors for help.
