In all seriousness, do let me know what fires/thorns you want me quelling over the next

It’s important I stand fast, and alongside you.

You have carried yourself admirably today.

As I retire for the night, I’m reminded of a poem my father was awfully fond of. It seems
very apt.

Good night, Jes.

Worry not of tomorrow’s end
Hurry not towards falling trees
Ignore at once, the jesters dance
Sigh, oh sigh, at the folly foiled
Take down the mighty route of ills
Lest not make a scratch in time
Evenhanded wins fair stance.
Broken wooden spoons we take
Left, oh left, in such a state
