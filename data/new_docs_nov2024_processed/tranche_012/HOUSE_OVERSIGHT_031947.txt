Europe’s Contagion

Editorial

November 16, 2011 -- Two years of gross mismanagement of the
euro-zone debt crisis have all too predictably produced a wider crisis
of market confidence that now threatens the entire 17-nation euro
zone. This week’s formation of new technocrat-led governments in
Greece and Italy has not calmed fears. Practically every euro zone
country is paying the price in higher interest costs and ebbing
economic growth.

The only country that isn’t suffering — yet — is Germany, whose
competitive export-driven economy feeds on foreign demand and an
exchange rate held down by its neighbors’ troubles. But all European
countries cannot be Germany and run net surpluses, especially if
Berlin insists on policies that keep factories shuttered and workers
unemployed.

And German leaders are wrong if they think their country will remain
unscathed as its major trading partners and neighbors unravel.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been talking a more pro-
European line. But she is still insisting on growth-killing austerity as
the price for European bailouts and still blocking the European
Central Bank from printing more euros and acting as a lender of last
resort.

Mrs. Merkel’s advisers insist that she is doing what the German
people want. That is not leadership. She needs to challenge her
voters’ simplistic stereotypes of southern European sloth and tell
them the truth: The real threat to Germany isn’t inflation; it is an
economic collapse across Europe. And Germany has a huge amount
to lose from a fracturing of the European Union.
