The South African Safari Goes Posh

Morukuru - South Africa

In the heart of the Madikwe Game Reserve, Morukuru Family's trio of
boutique-chic, exclusive lodging options are the perfect pick for small
groups seeking an intimate, totally tailor-made bush adventure. Half
wild, half unabashedly posh, the getaway is less than a four-hour drive -
or an even shorter charter plane ride - from Johannesburg. Choose
between the Owners House, the Lodge or the Farm, and the the only
people you'll share sundowners and lion cub photos ops with will be the
pack you arrived with. Family-friendly and super flexible, this is a true
South African safari vacation, complete with personal cooks, butlers and
animal trackers at your service.
