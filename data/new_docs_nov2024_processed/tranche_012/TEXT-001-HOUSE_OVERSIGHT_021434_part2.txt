The latest alleged victim

Palm Beach mansion in 2004

another girl recruited her 
to go there to give Epstein a 
massage. 
Once there, she alleges, 
she was led to an upstairs 
room with a massage table.

only a towel around his waist 
and told her to remove her 
clothes. She did, except for

The two attended the same

school. Jane Doe No. 2 is now

that Epstein, 55, targeted 
economically disadvantaged

perceived as less likely to

whose credibility would be 
quectpned if they did. 
Both complaints are full of 
lies, said Guy Lewis, former 
U.S. attorney in Miami and 
one of Epstein's many attor-
neys. Jane Doe No. 2's lawsuit 
is an outrageous, defamatory 
copycat of the first 
There has been a twist in 
the first Jane Doe lawsuit. Her 
mother in Georgia contends 
that her former husband 
— Jane. Doe's father — con-
sulted with neither of them 
before filing the lawsuit She 
is asking a judge to halt the 
litigation until her daughter 
turns 18 in May and can make 
her own decisions. 
The mother asked in court 
filings to be added to the law-
suit, saying she has suffered 
and will continue to suffer 
severe mental anguish and 
pain as a result of Epstein's 
reckless conduct. 
Jane Doe just didn't'want 
the lawsuit • going forward 
with the father's involve-
ment, said Ted Leopold, 
the mother's attorney She 
wanted to pursue it on her 
own. The father essentially 
did this on his own. 
Jane Doe has • been es-
tranged from her father since 
Thanksgiving, Leopold said. 
That's why it's even stranger 
what he did, he said. 
The girl's mother is asking 
a judge in their divorce case 
to find the father in contempt 
of court for violating their 
divorce decree by not con-
ferring with her on a matter 
involving their daughter. 
The father has sole custo-
dy and has the right to make 
decisions on his daughter's 
rights, Herman said. 
Epstein is a wealthy New 
York money manager who 
has counted Bill Clinton, 
Donald Trump and Britain's 
Prince Andrew among his 
friends. He was the target of 
a lengthy investigation into 
his activities with girls by the 
Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment that resulted in his in-
dictment in July 2006 on one 
count of felony solicitation 
of prostitution. That case is 
pending. 
Epstein has been sued in 
New York by a woman who 
says he had sex with her 
when she was 16. Herman 
said he has received calls 
from others making the same 
assertions in that state. 
Herman convened a news 
conference Wednesday on 
the middle bridge connecting 
West Palm Beach and Palm 
Beach. 
This is the bridge ... these 
girls were recruited to come 
over and give a massage, he 
said. When they crossed this 
bridge, they had no idea what 
was in store for them, This is 
a bridge of tears. 
Herman has described 
both Jane Does as typical 
teenage girls Epstein robbed 
of their innocence. 
But Harvard University law 
Professor Alan Dershowitz, 
another Epstein attorney, pro-
vided the state attorney's of-
fice with information gleaned 
from the myspacekom Web 
site two years ago showing 
that some of Epstein's alleged 
victims boasted of their alco-
hol and marijuana use. 
Herman said the girls' 
backgrounds aren't relevant 
to Epstein's purported 'be-
havior They don't have the 
mental capacity to consent 
to something like this with a 
grown man, he said.

Girl drops lawsuit against Palm Beach man 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
A girl who says that wealthy money 
manager and part-time Palm Beach 
resident Jeffrey Epstein engaged in 
'• sexual activity with her when she was 
14, has dropped her lawsuit against 
him because her divorced parents are 
squabbling over the litigation. 
It has to do with the fact that the 
parents aren't on the same page right 
• now said Jeffrey Herman, the attorney 
• for the girl, identified in court papers 
only as Jane Doe. It's like a sideshow 
The girl turns 18 in May and can sue 
• again at that time without her parents' 
involvement, Herman said. 
Herman sued Epstein last month on 
• 
behalf of the girl, her father and her 
Stepmother. Her birth mother, who lives 
near Atlanta, then asked- to intervene 
on her daughter's behalf and asked that

the litigation be halted 
until her daughter 
turns 18. 
• The mother com-
plained that Jane Doe's 
father did not consult 
with her or their 
daughter before suing 
Epstein ' for $50mi1-
lion. The lawsuit al-
leges sexual assault, 
intentional infliction 
of emotional distress 
and loss of parental 
consortium. Herman 
also represents a Jane 
Doe No. 2 who, like Jane Doe, claims 
Epstein summoned her to his home for 
a massage when she was a minor and 
sexually touched her. 
Epstein, 55, induced several under-
age girls to give him sexual niassages 
at his Intracoastal home, a Palm Beach 
Police Department investigation con-
cluded. He was indicted in. July 2006 on 
a single count of felony solicitation of 
prostitution. The case is pending. 
Jane Doe's parents separated two ' 
months after she was born at Good Sa-
maritan Medical Center, according to 
court records. The couple's subsequent 
divorce has been contentious. Each has 
had primary custody of the girl at various 
times. 
The father pleaded guilty to. fed-
eral fraud charges in 2001 and was sen-
tenced to 21 months in federal prison, 
plus three years probation. The US. 
attorney overseeing his prosecution 
was Guy Lewis. Now in private practice, 
Lewis was hired by Epstein to defend 
him against the father's lawsuit filed on 
behalf of Jane Doe.

Another suit alleges 
sex during massage 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH 
— Another woman filed a 
federal lawsuit against Jef-
frey Epstein on Wednesday, 
• alleging that he turned a 
massage she gave him at his 
Palm Beach mansion into a 
sexual episode when she was 
16 years old. 
Identified as Jane Doe 
No. 3, she is seeking more 
than $50 million, the same 
as two other Jane Does who 
filed similar lawsuits in the 
past six weeks. All three Suits 
were filed by Miami lawyer 
Jeffrey Herman. 
Herman subsequently 
'withdrew the first Jane Doe's 
lawsuit because of squabbling 
by her parents over the litiga-
tion. The girl may refile the 
suit after she turns 18 in May 
and can make her own deci-
sions, Herman said. 
Other alleged victims also 
have contacted him, Herman 
said. I do anticipate more 
cases, he said. 
In the latest litigation, Jane 
Doe No. 3 alleges that she 
was recruited by a former col-
lege student, Haley Robson, 
to give Epstein a massage for 
money at his waterfront home 
late in 2004 or early in 2005. 
The lawsuit alleges that, 
while on the massage table, 
Epstein sexually touched 
Jane Doe No. 3, then mas-
turbated. She is suing on 
grounds of sexual assault and 
intentional infliction of emo-
tional distress. 
She felt intimidated. She 
felt scared, Herman said. 
Jane Doe No. 3 made only the 
one visit to Epstein's home, 
he said. 
It's just another copycat 
lawsuit filed by the same 
lawyer who appears less 
interested in the truth than 
in grandstanding with these 
press conferences, said Jack 
Goldberger, one of Epstein's 
attorneys. We now have 
sworn testimony that girls 
lied about their age to Jeffrey 
Epstein, and they were care-
ful in being convincing that . 
they were over the age of 18. 
Herman said Robson 
instructed Jane Doe No. 3, 
When he asks how old you 
are, tell him 18 or 19 years 
old. But he said it doesn't 
matter. They were underage 
girls, Herman said. They 
were sexually assaulted. 
In addition to the civil law-
suits, Epstein was indicted 
on a single count of felony 
solicitation of prostitution 
in July 2006 after a lengthy 
Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment investigation into his 
activities with underage girls 
dt his home. A resolution has 
been delayed continually. The 
case is on Monday's court 
docket but is expected to be 
rescheduled once again. 
One of the reasons (Jane 
Doe No. 3) came forward is 
she is tired of waiting for jus-
tice, Herman said.

Girl, sues Epstein, two others

Jane Doe,' 1? sues in state court 
after dropping a federal suit. 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — A former Palm 
Beach Community College student who 
police say procured underage girls to give 
Jeffrey Epstein sexual massages at his Palm 
Beach mansion, and Epstein's personal assis-
tant have been sued along with Epstein over 
their alleged conduct. 
The girl behind the lawsuit was 14 years 
old when she contends he engaged in sexual 
conduct with her after she went to his water-
front home in 2005 to give him a massage. 
Her lawsuit, filed under the name Jane Doe, 
seeks unspecified damages from Epstein for 
sexual assault and intentional infliction of 
emotional distress. 
She also sued Epstein, Haley Robson of 
Loxahatchee and Sarah Kellen of New York 
City on grounds of conspiracy and civil rack-
eteering. 
We just want a full measure of justice for 
this girl, said her attorney, Ted Leopold. 
Robson, who attended Palm Beach Com-
munity College, was paid by Epstein to bring 
girls to his mansion for massages and more, 
according to Palm Beach police. I'm like a 
Heidi Fleiss, they said she told them. Her 
attorney could not be reached immediately 
for comment. 
Kellen was an Epstein personal assistant 
who arranged the encounters, even escort-
ling the girls to his massage room, police 
Epstein 
In,dexing: 
These two conspired With 
him to help with the criminal 
enterprise, Leopold said. 
Jane Doe, through her 
father and stepmother, filed 
a federal lawsuit against 
Epstein in January She dis-
missed it after her mother 
said she wasn't consulted 
about the litigation and 
sought to intervene. The 
mother is acting on her daughter's behalf in 
the latest lawsuit. 
Epstein's lawyer has denied the girl's al-
legations and said her family is simply at-
tempting to get money from a very rich man. 
Epstein, 55, is a Manhattan money manager 
who has homes there, in New Mexico and the 
Virgin Islands, in addition to his $8.5 million 
Palm. Beach mansion. 
Two other Jane Does have sued Epstein 
in federal court this year, making similar al-
legations to those of the first Jane Doe. Those 
cases remain active. 
Also pending against Epstein in state court 
is a felony charge of solicitation of prostitu-
tion arising from the same alleged incidents 
with several girls. That case is set for' trial in 
July, two years, after he was indicted. 
° Jane Doe's new lawsuit, filed in Palm Beach 
County Circuit Court, is the most explicit in 
detailing Epstein's alleged misconduct. It is 
the only suit to include Robson and Kellen 
as defendants, and the only one to make con-
spiracy and racketeering allegations. 
Jane Doe will turn 18 in May. She lives with 
other family members in Palm Beach County, 
is nearing graduation from high school and is 
working part time, Leopold said.

Beacher 
pleads in 
sex case 
Jeffrey Epstein will 
serve 11/2 years on teen 
solicitation charges. 
By. LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — He 
lives in a Palm Beach water-
front mansion and has kept 
company with the likes of 
President Clinton, Prince An-
drew and Donald Trump, but 
investment banker Jeffrey Ep-
stein will call the Palm Beach 
County Jail home for the next 
18 months. 
Epstein, 55, pleaded guilty 
Monday to felony solicitation 
of prostitution and procuring 
a person under the age of 18 
for prostitution. After serving 
18 months in jail, he will be 
under house arrest for a year. 
And he ,will have a lifelong 
obligation to register as a sex 
offender. He must submit to 
an HIV test within 48 hours, 
with the results being pro-
vided to his victims or their 
parents. 
As part of the plea deal, 
federal investigators agreed 
to drop their investigation 
of Epsteih, Which they had 
taken to a grand jury, two law 
enforcement sources said. 
. Epstein was indicted two 
years ago after an 11-month 
investigation by Palm Beach 
police: They received a 
complaint from a relative of 
a 14-year-old girl who had 
given Epstein a naked mas-
sage at his five-bedroom, 
7,234-square-foot, $8.5 million 
Intracoastal home. 
Police concluded that there

'It's validation 
of what we're saying 
in the civil cases.' 
JEFFREY HERMAN 
Attorney who represents alleged 
victims, commenting on the plea 
The judge was skeptical but 
agreed to it. 
Epstein's legal woes don't 
end with Monday's plea. 
There are four pending fed-
eral civil lawsuits and one 
in state court related to his 
behavior. At least one woman 
has sued him in New York, 
where he owns a 51,000-
square-foot Manhattan man-
sion. 
It's validation of what 
we're saying in the civil 
cases, said Miami attorney 
Jeffrey Herman, who repre-
sents the alleged victims in 
the federal lawsuits. West 
Palm Beach attorney Ted 
Leopold represents one al-
leged victim in a civil suit in 
state court. He said he antici-
pates amending that lawsuit 
to add a few other clients 
as well. 
In the criminal case, po-
lice went so far as to scour 
Epstein's trash and conduct 
surveillance at Palm Beach 
International Airport, where 
they watched for his private 
jet so they would know when 
he was in town. They con-
cluded that Epstein paid girls 
$200 to $300 each after the 
massage sessions. 
I'm like a Heidi Fleiss, 
Haley Robson, now 22, told 
police about her efforts in 
recruiting girls for Epstein. 
There was probable cause 
to chaise Epstein with un-
lawful sex acts with .a minor 
and lewd and lascivious mo-
lestation, police concluded. 
The state attorney's of-
fice said questions about 
the girls' credibility led it to 
take the unprecedented step 
of presenting the evidence 
against Epstein to a grand 
jury rather than directly 
charging him. 
Palm Beach Police Chief 
Michael Reiter was furious 
with State Attorney Barry 
Krischer, saying in a May 
2006 letter that the prosecu-
tor should disqualify himself. 
I continue to find your 
office's treatment of these 
cases highly unusual, he 
wrote. He then asked for and 
got a federal investigation. 
Epstein hired a phalanx of 
high-priced lawyers — includ-
ing Harvard law professor 
and author Alan Dershowitz 
— and public relations people 
who questioned Reiter's com-
petence and the victims' 
truthfulness. 
In addition to mansions 
in Palm Beach and Manhat-
tan, Epstein owns homes in 
New Mexico and the Virgin 
Islands. He's a frequent con-
tributor to Democratic Party 
candidates. He also donated 
$30 million to Harvard in 
2003. 
Former New York Gov. 
Eliot Spitzer returned a 
$50,000 campaign contribu-
tion from Epstein after his 
indictment, then resigned 
this year during his own sex 
scandal. And the same Palm 
Beach Police Department 
that vigorously investigated 
Epstein returned his $90,000 
donation for the purchase of 
a firearms simulator.

staff researcher Michelle Quig-
ley contributed to this story.

Edition: Palm Beach Post 
Rich man fought the law 
and he mostly won 
Two years after a grand jury 
indicted him on a felony charge of 
solicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey 
Epstein finally admitted that he 
lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 mil-
lion, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach 
mansion for sex. A week ago, the 
.55-year-old investment banker be-
gan serVing 18 months in jail. 
But that plea deal — guilty of 
felony solicitation of prostitution 
and procuring a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitution — does 
not account for all five of the girls, 
one as young as 14, who alleged that 
 Epstein sexually abused them. And 
why is Epstein serving his 
term in the overcrowded 
Palm Beach County Jail 
and not a state prison, 
where inmates are sent if 
their sentences are longer 
than one year? 
The slow, dissatisfy-
ing resolution of the case 
sends a message to the 
public that there's a dif-
ferent system of justice for 
the wealthy who hire high-powered 
lawyers. Epstein's legal team includ-
ed West Palm Beach defense attor-
ney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law 
School Professor Alan Dershowitz, 
who defended 0.J. Simpson against 
murder charges, and Kenneth 
Starr, the prosecutor who pursued 
then-President Bill Clinton for lying 
about sex with young women. 
Palm Beach police spent 11 
months investigating Epstein be-
fore State Attorney Barry Krischer 
sent the case to a grand jury in-
stead of charging Epstein so the 
man who once boasted of accepting 
c;nly billionaire clients could face a 
trial. The police had taken a high 
school transcript, class schedules 
and phone messages from Epstein's 
Why is Jeffrey Epstein in 
jail, and not prison? 
home that showed he knew the girls 
were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer 
was more swayed by Epstein 's law-
yers, who attempted to impugn the 
girls' character by showing they 
had chatted on myspace.com about 
smoking marijuana and drinking. 
He should have let a jury decide 
whether the victims — and Epstein 
— were credible. 
Ultimately, one charge against 
Epstein finally reflected 
the age of one victim, and 
the plea agreement left 
Epstein labeled a sex of-
fender. With that additional 
charge, if Epstein had been 
convicted at a trial, he 
could have been sentenced 
to anything from probation 
to 15 years in prison, Assis-
tant State Attorney Lanna 
Belohlavek said, adding that the 
recommended guideline sentence 
was 21 months. 
Epstein also won't have to cer-
tify to the court that he is receiv-
ing counseling, typically required 
of sex offenders, because he has 
a private psychiatrist But without 
court supervision, who will ensure 
Epstein is in fact being treated? 
The plea deal also drops a federal 
investigation of Epstein. If a federal 
investigation was warranted, how 
does dropping it before completion 
benefit the public? 
Epstein preyed on girls and de-
nied it. For three years, his wealth 
and the influence of his lawyers 
bought him the protection the state 
attorney owed to the victims.

THREE young women suing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein for sex abuse 
at his Palm Beach mansion want a federal judge to quash the plea 
deal he made with the state of Florida to serve 18 months in jail in 
exchange for admitting he solicited a 14-year-old hooker. Their 
lawyer, Brad Edwards, has asked US District Judge Kenneth Marra 
to toss the deal - which included an agreement that Epstein's wouldn't 
face federal prosecution, which could have led to a longer jail term - 
because they weren't consulted on it. Marra has asked for more 
information before he rules. Epstein's rep, Howard Ruben stein, 
said, The lawsuit has absolutely no merit. They're just looking for 
money. These women have lied repeatedly, and in no way shape or 
form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. 
And one of them showed Epstein a fake ID.

AS A CRIME VICTIM, YOU HAVE THE 
FOLLOWING RIGHTS under 
18 United States Code, Section 3771: 
The right to be reasonably protected from the 
accused; 
O The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of 
any public court proceeding, or any parole 
proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or 
escape of the accused; 
cp The right not to be excluded from any such public 
court proceeding, unless the court, after reviewing 
clear and convincing evidence, determines that 
testimony by the victim would be materially altered if 
the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding; 
The right to be reasonably heard at any public 
proceeding in the district court involving the release, 
plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding; 
• The right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government in the case; 
• The right to full and timely restitution as provided in 
law; 
O The right to proceedings free from unreasonable 
delay; 
G The right to be treated with fairness and with respect 
for the victim's dignity and privacy. 
We will make our best efforts to ensure you are 
afforded the rights described. Most of these rights 
pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an 
individual for the crime, and it will be the responsibility 
of the prosecuting United States Attorney's Office to 
ensure you are afforded those rights. You may also 
seek the advice of a private attorney with respect to 
these rights. 
IF YOU ARE THREATENED OR HARASSED 
Your safety is paramount. If anyone threatens you or you feel 
that you are being harassed because of your cooperation with 
this investigation, there are available remedies. If you are 
in immediate danger, contact your local law enforcement 
agency mmediately. Also, you should contact your Victim 
Specialist or the Case Agent and inform them of the 
situation. There are penalties for harassment and other 
threats; therefore, it is important that you report any 
incident as soon as possible. 
IF YOU NEED FINANCIAL HELP OR 
SUPPORT SERVICES 
All states have crime victims compensation programs 
that help cover some expenses resulting from violent crimes. 
Your state program may pay for medical and mental health 
care costs, lost wages and support, and funeral and burial 
expenses not covered by insurance or other benefits. Your 
FBI Victim Specialist may be able to help intercede on your 
behalf with employers and creditors, when appropriate. In 
addition, your Victim Specialist can refer you to other types of 
programs and services, such as emergency housing, 
counseling, support groups, and credit counseling. If the 
offender is convicted or pleads guilty, the court may order 
payment by the offender, called restitution, which may help 
cover expenses and losses caused by your victimization. 
IF YOUR PROPERTY WAS STOLEN OR 
HELD AS EVIDENCE 
If your property was stolen, we hope 
WI 
to recover it as part of our 
investigation and return it as soon 
as possible. If your property is held 
as evidence, we will notify you, 
maintain it in good condition, 
and make every effort to see 
that it is returned to you as quickly 
as possible when it is no longer 
needed as evidence. 
Please understand that some property we receive as 
evidence has been damaged during the course of the crime. 
IF AN ARREST IS MADE 
Every effort will be made to notify you if a suspect is 
apprehended. If criminal charges are filed, you will be 
contacted by the United States Attorney's Office (USA0) 
assigned to handle your case. 
Each USA° has a Victim Witness Coordinator 
to help answer your questions and deal with 
your concerns during the prosecution of the 
case.

Introduction 
The Department of Justice and the United States 
Postal Inspection Service are committed to ensuring 
that victims of federal crime are treated fairly as their 
case moves through the criminal justice system. 
In order to provide victims with information on case 
events, the Department of Justice has developed the 
Victim Notification System (VNS). This brochure 
provides information about VNS. 
Victim Notification System (VNS) 
VNS is a cooperative effort between the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States 
Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), the United States 
Attorneys' Offices, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
(BOP). 
This free, computer-based system provides important 
information to victims. In many cases you will 
receive letters generated through VNS containing 
information about the events pertaining to your case 
and/or any defendants in the case. 
This information is also available in English and 
Spanish on the Internet and through a toll-free 
telephone number (Call Center). In cases with many 
victims, you may receive only one letter and then be 
directed to the Internet or Call Center for further 
information. 
VNS Information 
Registration:  
You will receive a Victim Identification Number 
(YIN) and a Personal Identification Number (PIN) 
that will allow you to access VNS on the Internet and 
using your telephone. You may write those numbers 
on the attached tear-off card to keep with you. 
If you have chosen to participate in VNS, but have 
not received these numbers, please contact either the 
FBI, the USPIS, or U.S. Attorney's Office handling 
your case.
