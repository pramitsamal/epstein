MR. SCAROLA: Because of concern about a --
an inadvertent potential waiver of the
work-product privilege, while it is not our
intent to assert a privilege with regard to
nonexistent communications, any effort to
identify the subject matter of communications in
the questions that you asked will require that we
assert work-product privilege with regard to
those questions.

MR. SIMPSON: Okay. We disagree, obviously,
on that position.

MR. SCAROLA: We understand.

MR. SIMPSON: So I will ask some additional
questions and we will see if the witness answers
them.

MR. SCAROLA: If it begins: “Did you talk
about, the answer is going to be an assertion of
privilege.

MR. SIMPSON: Okay.

MR. SCAROLA: Okay?

MR. SIMPSON: [ll ask the questions.
