Virginia Roberts.

I knew Josefsberg was an attorney who had
represented Miss Roberts based on public
information, and I knew that that would be a
gross violation of Mr. Josefsberg's
attorney/client obligations. And as a result of
that, it seemed to me that, once again,

Mr. Dershowitz was giving false information under
oath In an effort to exculpate himself from the
sex trafficking that he had been involved with.

In addition to that, I learned during the
deposition on Thursday that it had, quote, not
crossed my mind, close quote -- I believe that's
a direct quote from Mr. Dershowitz -- to record a
conversation with a woman allegedly named Rebecca
who had allegedly made certain statements. That
was on Thursday.

And then yesterday, Friday, I learned that
Mr. Dershowitz, not only had it crossed his mind
to make a recording, he had, in fact, made such a
recording; and in fact, had it transcribed; and
in fact, turned it over to his attorneys. So,
once again, I had what appeared to be a false
statement under oath by Mr. Dershowitz in an
attempt to exculpate himself from the -- the sex

trafficking that we -- we have evidence he has
been involved with.

The false statements or certainly misleading
statements continue. I suppose, some of these
could be a matter of judgment. The -~ they raise
grave concern to me.

One of them was that we had propounded an
interrogatory requesting the basis for
Mr, Dershowitz's statements that Virginia Roberts
had a criminal record. And he said that, well,
she's admitted that she had sex with various
people, so that renders her a criminal, and
something along those lines, which I didn’t think
was very accurate.

But in any event, that was the answer he
gave. And then I learned during the deposition
in the last two days, that Mr. Dershowitz had
received information that he says shows that
Virginia Roberts had stolen money from a
restaurant and had been criminally charged with
that,

That was not produced to us during discovery,
even though it would have been obviously
relevant, and it was directly called for in the
discovery that we were provided with.

You know, I also have -- I would like to
refresh my recollection and if ~~ if counsel --
that's --
MR. SCAROLA: You can refresh your
recollection on anything you need to.
THE WITNESS: All right. I'd like to refresh
my recollection by looking at --
MR. SIMPSON: Actually, I -~ I object to this
answer as nonresponsive. I haven't heard
anything about flight logs once.
MR. SCAROLA: You can continue.
THE WITNESS: These -- you know, these all go
to the statements.
BY MR. SIMPSON:
Q. You're looking at a document?
A. Yeah. Let's mark it as an exhibit if you'd
like. This is a memory aid to me.
Q. Did you prepare it?
A. Yes, I did. All right. Let's see. At page
114 of a rough transcript that I saw prepared of
Thursday's testimony, Mr. Dershowitz was asked. Quote:
You know that Virginia Roberts is not the only person
who has sworn under oath that you were present at
Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach home with young girls,
right? Answer: No.

That seemed to me to be false or at the very
least misleading testimony given that Mr. Dershowitz
knew that Juan Alessi, among potentially other people,
had identified him as having been in the presence of
Jeffrey Epstein and young girls at the Florida mansion
and, indeed, had identified a photograph of Virginia
Roberts,

At page 164 of the transcript, Mr. Dershowitz
was asked, quote: All of the manifests that have been
produced in this litigation, the ones that you say
corroborate your testimony and exonerate you,
demonstrate that you never flew on Jeffrey Epstein's
plane in the company of your wife, correct? Answer:
No, that's not true. I don't know that.

And, again, in the context of this litigation
where the flight logs have been, as this question that
I'm answering tends to show, are so central for
Mr. Dershowitz to testify under oath that he didn't know
whether his wife was depicted on the flight log, struck
me as, at the very least, misleading information, but I
concluded in my opinion was actually deliberately false
information, particularly, given this litigation where
he has produced, not only his own personal travel
record, but all of his wife's travel records for the
relevant period of time.
