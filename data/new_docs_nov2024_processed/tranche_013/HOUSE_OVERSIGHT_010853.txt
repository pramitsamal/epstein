So I thought that was, again, a deliberate
faise statement under oath designed to exculpate him
from his criminal involvement in this international sex
trafficking ring.

At another point in the transcript, he was
asked, quote, -- no, I'm sorry. He stated, quote: I
challenge you to find any statement where I said I have
never traveled outside the presence of my wife, close
quote, representing that there would be no such
statement there, when, in fact, I'm aware of an American
Lawyer quotation attributed to him from January 15th,
2015, quote: I've been married to the same woman for 28
years. She goes with me everywhere, close quote. And,
again, you know, this -- I understand sometimes people
may go away from their wife, but the American Lawyer
was, obviously, on January 15th, 2015, asking about:
Well, have you been outside the presence of your wife in
situations where you might have interacted with Virginia
Roberts? And that was the answer that he gave to the
American Lawyer.

And based on -- on my review of the flight
fogs, I thought that was, again, a deliberate effort to
obscure and try to exculpate himself from his
involvement in this International sex trafficking ring.

The -- he also said yesterday: Nobody knows

about Prince Andrew and Virginia, except for the two of
them. And, again, I thought that was at a minimum,
deliberately mis -- misleading information and more
likely deliberately false information, because
Mr. Dershowitz was aware of the photograph and had long
been aware of the photograph that shows Prince Andrew
with his arm around Virginia Roberts, standing next to a
beaming Glenn Maxwell who has been involved in this
international sex trafficking organization.

And in the circumstances of that photograph,
it seems quite likely that the photographer who took
that picture was the head of the international sex
trafficking ring, Jeffrey Epstein. And so for him to
say that only two people knew what went on was, again,
deliberately faise information, because I know he is the
attorney for Jeffrey Epstein, and he could have asserted
attorney/client privilege over that, said, I can't get
into my communications with my client about what he was
doing with Prince Andrew.

But instead he said, no one knows what
happened, other than those two people in circumstances
where it was quite clear that there would have been
others who would have been aware of that.

Now, the question is: Why do I think the --
the -- you know, there are inaccuracies in the flight

logs. And I could refresh my recollection here by
looking at, I think it's docket entry 291 of our
pleading that we presented on January 21st to
Judge Marra where we provided specific itemized examples
of inconsistencies between the Dave Rogers’ flight log
and the -- again, I'll call it, the Alan Dershowitz
flight log, which was a selected presentation of flight
log information,

And when you see those inconsistencies, it
becomes very hard to believe that all of the information
that was provided in those flight logs was accurate. So
when I take all of that information, put it together, I
believe that there's sufficient -- I have a sufficient
basis for believing at this point in time, that
Mr. Dershowitz has, indeed, provided inaccurate
information to -- to law enforcement agencies, or at a
minimum has provided -- has produced inaccurate
information through circumstances beyond his control.

But when he continually represents that the
information is accurate and exonerates him, I believe
that that is a deliberately false statement.

MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike the answer --

the nonresponsive portion of the answer.
MR. SCAROLA: Which portion is that?
MR. SIMPSON: 99 percent of it. I think at

the end, we got to the flight logs.
I move to strike the nonresponsive portion.
BY MR. SIMPSON:
Q. Mr. Cassell, you came here today looking for
an opportunity to give that statement; did you not?
A. If it was relevant to an answer I was giving,
yes.
Q. The answer to my question is, yes, you came
here today looking for a question to which you could
respond with that prepared statement?
A. Iwas prepared to give that -- I anticipated
that a very good attorney for Mr. Dershowitz might ask a
question where that would be relevant. And if that
question were asked and I was given the opportunity to
make that statement, I wanted to be prepared to give it
in the most accurate way that I could.
MR. SIMPSON: I would like the reporter to
mark as Exhibit -- are we up to 4 ~- Exhibit 4,
the document that Mr. Cassell was referring to.
lil fet the reporter do that.
THE WITNESS: Okay.
(Casseil's 1.D. Exhibit No. 4 - document
produced by the witness was marked for identification.)
MR. SIMPSON: I just want to make that part
of the record.
