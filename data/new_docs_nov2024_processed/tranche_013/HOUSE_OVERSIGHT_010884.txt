033638 1 couple of lines above it that do refer to Virginia 0338027 1 A. The lawyer -- look, this is not the first

033633 2 Roberts, put it in the context. 033827 2 time --

033641 3 My question is: Does that, fairly read, 033827 3 Q. I'm not asking the --

03346 10 there is, up above -- you cited 18 to 20 -- 22 to 25 --
o3e46 11 no, 18 to 20. I'msorry. You cited 18 to 20 which is
