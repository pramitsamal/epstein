MR. SIMPSON: I've got --
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Two minutes.
MR. SIMPSON: Two minutes. All right. That
won't take --
BY MR. SIMPSON:
Q. I want you to look at the video of that --
that testimony. Would you play it, please, for the
witness? This is from the videotape of the deposition.
THE WITNESS: I do not want to watch just --
I want to watch -- what -- what I'm seeing here
as I dive into this, I would -- if you're going
to ask me questions about what's in these
particular lines, I want to see -- I want to go
back. I want all of the -- the relevant parts of
Virginia Roberts's testimony played. And I
believe there are approximately four points in
the transcript where she’s mentioned, so can we
play all four of those?
MR, SCAROLA: We are not going to do that.
We have run out of time. Per agreement, this was

supposed to stop at noon.
MR. SIMPSON: Okay.
MR. SCAROLA: It is now 12:12, so this
deposition is ended. There were a lot of things

that I would have like to have finished with
Professor Dershowitz and wasn't permitted to do
that. So by agreement, this deposition is now
over.

MR, SIMPSON: It -- it's -- it's ending over
my objection and the witness's --
MR. SCAROLA: I -- I understand that.
MR, SIMPSON: -- the -- I'm going to make my

record,
MR. SCAROLA: Okay.
MR. SIMPSON: -- the witness's refusal to

look at the videotape of the portion of the
deposition that he just characterized in his
testimony as suggesting an affirmative answer to
the question of whether Virginia Roberts and
Professor Dershowitz were there at the same time,
and I will represent --

MR. SCAROLA: That record is clear.

MR. SIMPSON: -- and anyone looking at that
videotape would know, to a moral certainty, that
that was false.

THE WITNESS: Okay. And I -- I want to make
clear that I would be happy to look at
everything. We will do that at another time
perhaps.
