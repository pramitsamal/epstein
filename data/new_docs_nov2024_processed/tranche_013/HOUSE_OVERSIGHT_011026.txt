the partial exception of Becker. I will generally prefer (5.3a), although the two are

identical in meaning.

Schultz’ analysis of consumption found

consumption = invested consumption + pure consumption. (5.4)

This plus (5.1) and (5.3a) combine for

output = total growth + pure consumption
= investment + human growth + pure consumption
= investment + invested consumption + self-invested work
— recovered human depreciation + pure consumption
= investment + invested consumption + self-invested work
— recovered human depreciation + consumption
— invested consumption
= investment + consumption + self-invested work
— recovered human depreciation. (5.5)

“EX post net”, as always, should be understood before both “output” and

“investment”.

Chapter 6 will revisit this logic once again, and add a second way to the same

conclusion.

The Growth Equation Under the Y Rule

(5.1) can be arranged as
total growth = output - pure consumption, (5.1a)
as a counterpart to (4.1a). Total growth means growth in total capital. My argument

continues as in Chapter 4. Since (4.2) was a blind alley, skip to (4.3). That now

becomes
