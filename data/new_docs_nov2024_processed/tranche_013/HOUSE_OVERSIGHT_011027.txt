totalgrowth _— output pure consumption

which can be written as
total growth rate = total capital productivity
— pure consumption rate, (5.6a)

as with (4.3a). Since (5.6a) is always true, and not only under occasional

circumstances, we also get

change in total growth rate = change in total capital productivity

—changein pure consumption rate. (5.7)

This parallels the logic of (4.4). Again save space by reexpressing this as

total acceleration = total productivity + total thrift, (5.7a)

where “total” means “of total capital”. Now divide by total acceleration to reach the

counterparts of (4.5) and (4.5a).
I will sometimes save space, from now on, by expressing these arguments in the
equations of Chapter 4, as for example in leaving the words “total” and “pure”

implicit if the context shows that I mean them.

The Slave Paradox

Say that Phil enslaves Bill. Bill’s maintenance consumption had been taste-satisfying
pure consumption to Bill when Bill was free, and so was not deducted from his pay
to find his gross realized output as valued by himself. But Bill’s maintenance
consumption satisfies no tastes of Phil. Cash flow is gross realized output less

plowback from revenue less new investment from outside, for either factor, while
