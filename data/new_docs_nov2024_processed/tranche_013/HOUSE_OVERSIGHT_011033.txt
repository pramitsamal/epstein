do with words alone. One less something nearer zero, whether that something (the
thrift index) is positive or negative, is nearer one. The wonderful books of Einstein
(with Enfeld) and Steven Hawking, not to mention Mill, show that even calculus can
be put that way. My task has been to follow their tough act. But I will now start to
infiltrate notation where | think that that form of shorthand should help more then

it hurts.

Summary

The data for the free growth index of total capital @(Kt) in the charts and tables do
not represent a separate test. It is the same test adjusted to the three fourths rule.
That was proposed as a convenient rule of thumb. I would have shown a true
separate test if 1 knew how. Pure consumption might become separately measurable
some day, but human capital will not. The Phil and Bill parable shows that not even
evidence from slave markets would be on point. Human capital has no possible

value to any but its original owner.

Whether in words or notation, I hope to make the point that Chapter 4 and the
charts and tables showing ¢(K)are likely to understate the case for Mill. Those

showing @(K,) should be nearer the truth. Physical capital and pure consumption

are less than the whole. My three fourths rule will never be exact because reality
cares little for the convenience of modelers. Proportions between the kinds of

consumption will not hold exactly constant and will never exactly agree. But I don’t

think the three fourths rule is so wrong that the real value of g(K,,) doesn’t run

nearer one than the real value of @(K). (The infiltration begins.)

Then the data support free growth theory convincingly enough if we trust equation
(4.1), as do all macroeconomists as far as | know, and probably more convincingly

when human capital is considered too.
