that there was an investigation.
MR. PAGLIUCA: You know, she could be asked that
question: Did you know there was an investigation? I think

she's going to say no. I gave you her affidavit in which she

said prior to making her statement, she had never seen thes
police reports. So we all know --

THE COURT: That's a different question.

MR. PAGLIUCA: I understand. But we all know the

answer is, that's in these police reports, and I'm pretty sure

she testified at her deposition that she wasn't really aware of

this investigation. All she knew -- I think is what she
testified to -- was that Epstein went to jail and she knew at
some point he was a registered sex offender. Those are the two
things I think she knew at the end of the day at this

deposition. Anyway, I agree with you that the question, did

you know there was an investigation, you know, I suppose you
can ask that question and the answer will be yes or no,
whatever it is.
