Q As part of your employment with MC Square
did you live in New York, for a time?

A I'm sorry, but I take the Fifth.

Q Have you ever heard any model of MC Square
who at the time of being a minor, that means under
the age of eighteen, made an accusation that
Jean-Luc Burnel acted inappropriate with her?

A Never. And that is something that I will
not answer. And I said never because even when
peoples come and ask me I will always say the truth
regarding that.

I know Mr. Brunel for the longest --
maybe eight years. And I always said what I know.
I never saw and I never knew that he did anything.

So I know that. And that's the truth.

Never. I never heard anybody accusing Mr. Brunel
or complaining about Mr. Brunel. Nething.
Q That means -- that means at any time no

model, no minor model came to you and said, you
know, “Maritza, look what just happened to me, that,
something bad happened to me.

A Maybe a model came and told me, Maritza,
look what happen to me. I don't have any money,” or
T doen't have a place to live™. Or, Look, I didn't
get my ticket, or whatever.
