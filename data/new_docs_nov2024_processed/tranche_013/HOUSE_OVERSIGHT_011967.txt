MR. OBRONT: Well, I would object, because
of circumstances.
BY MPR. DAVID:
Q But you said before that you never heard
anything that would indicate that Jean-Luc Burnel
behaved inappropriately with -- with any models,

especially any minor models that MC Square may have

had.
Is that correct?
A Yeah, I said what is the truth. Nobody
cemplain to me. Nebody -- your question was very

clear, has any girl came to you and complain about

sexually, you know, involved with Mr. Brunel.

Q Right.
A And my answer was no. Nobody came to tell
me. I never saw. I never knew. His personal life

was net my problem.

Q Do yeu have any actual knowledge, that is
to say were you present or did you see with your own
eyes, any minor models go with Jean-Luc Burnel to
Jeffrey Epstein's home, or any party ef his?

MR. OBRONT: Objection.
THE WITNESS: T['m sorry, but I take the

Fifth
