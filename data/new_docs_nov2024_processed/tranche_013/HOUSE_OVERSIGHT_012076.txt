Banks and insurance companies
play a vital role in our financial
system, providing savings, fi-
nancing, investment, and pay-
ment services to consumers and
businesses of all sizes. Our mod-
ern economy requires a stable,
trustworthy, and efficient finan-
cial services industry to function
and grow. Active stewardship
can serve a role in maintaining a
strong financial system.

Bank managements should be
motivated to pursue best practic-
es, having experienced the con-
sequences of bad behavior long
after the Global Financial Crisis.
Tighter regulations, enacted in
the aftermath of the Global Fi-
nancial Crisis, including Basel III
and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protec-
tion Act, have increased capital
requirements and compliance
costs for financial institutions.
They have also limited aggressive
forms of lending and risk-taking.

In addition, banks have also in-
curred substantial legal penalties
for poor conduct ranging from
consumer loan servicing, market
manipulation, fraudulent activity,
and money laundering.

However, while new regulations
and legal settlements have placed
incremental financial burdens

on the financial services in-
dustry, banks and insurers have
since made substantial progress
to comply with new rules and
adjusted their business models
accordingly. Balance sheets have
been reinforced with additional
capital and liquidity, and tighter
underwriting. While this may limit
loan growth, it has also result-

ed in reduced risk costs in their
lending businesses. Banks have
added headcount in their compli-
ance and risk control divisions in
an effort to monitor and prevent
future misconduct.

With a new administration in
power in the United States, there
is some concern that an aggres-
sive pullback of regulations is
imminent. However, we believe
that higher quality banks and
insurers should remain conserva-
tive in maintaining their increased
regulatory capital, underwriting
standards, and compliance and
risk monitoring capabilities, as
failing to do so could draw the ire
of legislators and regulatory bod-
ies, as well as the general public.
This could lead to additional costs

through loan losses, further liti-

gation expenses, and even more
stringent regulations. We believe
that through active stewardship,
we can continue to promote re-

sponsible practices among these
companies.

Going forward, we expect banks
and other financial institutions
with adjusted business models,
that exhibit greater stability in
earnings and balance sheet qual-
ity to benefit financially in the
long run. A reduction of earnings
cyclicality should result in higher
investor confidence in dividend
payouts over time, and financial
stocks could see higher valuations
as a result. Swedish banks are

a prime example. Highly capi-
talized by global standards, with
minimal loan losses in their home
market even during economic
downturns, Swedish banks have
maintained premium valuations
(14x to 16x forward earnings, 1.6x
to 2x book value) compared to
their European peers (many trade
at 10x to 12x forward earnings,
<x book value). We believe this
represents significant potential
upside for long-term investors in
the sector.
