career. Ironically, she finds herself in prison awaiting trial while
the Korean stock market continues to trade at a discount to

A truly embarrassing South Korean political scandal emerged
in the fall of 2016 when a journalist discovered a computer
belonging to a personal confidant of President Park Geun-Hye.
