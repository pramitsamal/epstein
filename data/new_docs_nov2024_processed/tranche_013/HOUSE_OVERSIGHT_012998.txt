82 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures

and (except for the lowest level) supervenes over children whose spatiotemporal scope is a sub-
set of its own. The action hierarchy takes care of decomposing tasks into subtasks; whereas the
sensation hierarchy takes care of grouping signals into entities and events. The modeling /guid-
ance hierarchy mediates interactions between perception and action based on its understanding
of the world and the system’s goals.

In his book [AMO01] Albus describes methods for extending 4D/RCS into a complete cognitive
architecture, but these extensions have not been elaborated in full detail nor implemented.

4.5.5 PolyScheme

Nick Cassimatis’s PolyScheme architecture [Cas07| shares with GLAIR the use of multiple
logical reasoning methods on a common knowledge store. While its underlying ideas are quite
general, currently PolyScheme is being developed in the context of the “object tracking’ domain
(construed very broadly). As a logic framework PolyScheme is fairly conventional (unlike GLATR
or NARS with their novel underlying formalisms), but PolyScheme has some unique conceptual
aspects, for instance its connection with Cassimatis’s theory of mind, which holds that the same
core set of logical concepts and relationships underlies both language and physical reasoning
[Cas04]. This ties in with the use of a common knowledge store for multiple cognitive processes;
for instance it suggests that

e the same core relationships can be used for physical reasoning and parsing, but that each
of these domains may involve some additional relationships.

e language processing may be done via physical-reasoning-based cognitive processes, plus the
additional activity of some language-specific processes
