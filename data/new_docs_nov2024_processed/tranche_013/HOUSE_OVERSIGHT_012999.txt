4.5.6 Joshua Blue

Sam Adams and his colleagues at IBM have created a cognitive architecture called Joshua Blue
[AABLO2], which has some significant similarities to CogPrime. Similar to our current research
direction with CogPrime, Joshua Blue was created with loose emulation of child cognitive
development in mind; and, also similar to CogPrime, it features a number of cognitive processes
acting on a common neural-symbolic knowledge store. The specific cognitive processes involved
in Joshua Blue and CogPrime are not particularly similar, however. At time of writing (2012)
