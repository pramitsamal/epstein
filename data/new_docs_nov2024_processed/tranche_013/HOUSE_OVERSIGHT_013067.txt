8.5 The Cognitive Schematic

Now we return to the “cognitive schematic” notion, according to which various cognitive pro-
cesses involved in intelligence may be understood to work together via the implication

Context \ Procedure - Goal < p >

(summarized C A P > G). Semi-formally, this implication may be interpreted to mean: “If the
context C’ appears to hold currently, then if I enact the procedure P, I can expect to achieve
the goal G with certainty p.”

The cognitive schematic leads to a conceptualization of the internal action of an intelligent
system as involving two key categories of learning:

e Analysis: Estimating the probability p of a posited C A P > G relationship

e Synthesis: Filling in one or two of the variables in the cognitive schematic, given as-
sumptions regarding the remaining variables, and directed by the goal of maximizing the
probability of the cognitive schematic

More specifically, where synthesis is concerned, some key examples are:

e The MOSES probabilistic evolutionary program learning algorithm is applied to find P,
given fixed C' and G. Internal simulation is also used, for the purpose of creating a simulation
embodying C and seeing which P lead to the simulated achievement of G.

— Example: A virtual dog learns a procedure P to please its owner (the goal G) in the
conterzt C where there is a ball or stick present and the owner is saying “fetch”.

e PLN inference, acting on declarative knowledge, is used for choosing C, given fixed P and
G (also incorporating sensory and episodic knowledge as appropriate). Simulation may also
be used for this purpose.
