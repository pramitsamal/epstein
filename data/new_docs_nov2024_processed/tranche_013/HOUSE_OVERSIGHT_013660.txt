The subject of complex eigenvalues brings up in me the emotionally
disturbing subject of imaginary and complex numbers. | can still feel a little of my
earlier anxiety. The episode started benignly enough. Our high school’s freshman
algebra class was studying how to solve quadratic equations, equations in which
the highest power of an expression was two. Told to work at the blackboard in front
of the class, | was given the problem of finding the two values of x that were the

roots of the equation, 5x? + 3x + 4 = 0. | had been taught to use the memorized

_ + af 2
quadratic formula, rs in which a = 5, b = 3 and c = 4. | always
a

calculated the square root part first and wound up with the expression,

/9—80 =J/-71.| can still feel the sinking feeling in my stomach as | looked at the
result. | anticipated the usual snide remarks and embarrassment as | contemplated
doing what | did not know how to do, take the square root of a negative number. Mr.
Kirby, the retired mechanical engineer who was my high school freshman algebra
teacher tried to help, but | did not trust him. It seemed to me that he had already
humiliated me in front of the class, several times. He asked, “... what number when
squared, multiplied by itself, would equal —7.” He then asked it another way: solve

the following equation for x: x°+1 = 0. Seeing something | could do, | wrote the next

line quickly x° = -7 and then, taking the square root of both sides, | wrote x = V-1.

He then asked me what that meant. | answered by writing quickly, glibly and blindly

that that meant that J—1xV/—1=-1. He asked me to explain what that meant by
giving him an example from the real world. Not yet knowing about imaginary and
complex (combine real and imaginary numbers), | stood head down, ashamed and
silent, thinking that my smart friend Jerry Blau would get the answer immediately.
Mr. Kirby said he would go on with the class while | continued to stand in front of the
blackboard and thought about it. He told me to interrupt him when | was ready to
answer. Some classmates were smirking, others giggled aloud. They had seen him
do this to me before.

Mr. Kirby, a short, muscular man, an ex-marine with a military haircut and a
brusque manner, lectured that mathematical competence and obedience to

authority and class discipline were all of a piece. | asked him about mathematical
