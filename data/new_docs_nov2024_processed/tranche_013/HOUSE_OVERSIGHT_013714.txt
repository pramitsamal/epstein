as in nonlinear equations representing them and other brain processes (Mandell,
1983).

An early study of power spectral scaling in the EEG reported alpha band

fluctuations that extended a <P 6B ~ 1 pattern to 0.02 Hz (Musha, 1981), as did

other applications of the log-log power spectrum to the EEG in man (Hu and Hu,
1988; Prichard, 1992). This power law scaling led naturally to the suggestion that
the range of frequencies available in the electromagnetic signal from the calivarial
surface extends far beyond those currently appreciated and may be available for
study using relatively noise free recording techniques such as_ the
magnetoelectroencephalogram (Mandell and Selz, 1991). A not surprising range of
intrinsic correlation lengths reflected in Hurst > 0.5 and/or Levy exponents < 2 have
been reported in lamb fetal breathing patterns (Szeto et al, 1992). The exponent
has been shown to be sensitive to maternal alcohol intake in humans (Akay and
Mulder, 1998), rat neonatal motoric activity (Selz et al, 1995), and nuchal atonia
duration sequences (associated with putative intra-uterine REM sleep) in fetal
sheep (Anderson et al, 1998).

Sequential amplitudes in 1 Hz stimulated soleus spinal cord H-reflex

demonstrated a $F 6B ~ 0.83 in control subjects and, reflecting the decrement in

correlations, by 0.31 in patients with losses in supraspinal input from spinal cord
injury (Nozaki et al, 1996). Whereas the sequences of fixation times in eye
movements of normal control subjects reading difficult material demonstrated an
exponentially decaying distribution, those of schizophrenic patients demonstrated a
power law tail, consistent with more sequential correlations (Yokoyama et al, 1996).
This finding may be related to the appearance of velocity arrests, runs of sticky fixed
points, in a spatially oscillating target task, called “smooth pursuit eye movement
dysfunction” in schizophrenic patients which has been modeled as a parametric
disorder in a periodically driven nonlinear dynamical system (Huberman, 1987). The
“short time fractal dimension” has been used to discriminate acoustic signal

transformations from the speech of normal subjects and ataxic patients (Accardo
