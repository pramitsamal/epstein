applicability to other situations), the government should have fashioned a reasonable
way to inform the victims of the likelihood of criminal charges and to ascertain the
victims’ views on the possible details of a plea bargain.

The Fifth Circuit then remanded the matter to the district court to determine
the appropriate remedy for the violation of the victims’ rights.°

The Fifth Circuit’s decision in Dean has been cited favorably in four
recent district court decisions, which provides further support for the
conclusion that the CVRA applies before charges have been filed. In
United States v. Rubin,” victims of a federal securities fraud argued that
they had CVRA rights even before prosecutors filed a superseding
indictment covering the specific crimes affecting the victims. Citing Dean,
the District Court for the Eastern District of New York agreed that the
rights were expansive and could apply before charges were filed but were
subject to the outer limit that the Government has at least “contemplated”
charges.”

Similarly, in United States v. Oakum,” the District Court for the
Easter District of Virginia considered a claim that CVRA nghts did not
apply until after a defendant had been convicted. In rejecting that
argument, the court agreed with the Dean court that victims acquire rights
even before a prosecution begins.”

The District Court for the Northern District of Indiana held to the same
effect in In re Petersen. There, the court held that a victim’s right to be
treated with fairness and with respect for [his or her] dignity and privacy
“may apply before any prosecution is underway and isn’t necessarily tied to
a ‘court proceeding’ or ‘case.””’? The court, however, found that the
“conclusory allegations” in the victims’ petition did not “create a plausible
claim for relief under the CVRA.”’”°

proposition prove no such thing. Confusingly, Petersen cited the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in
