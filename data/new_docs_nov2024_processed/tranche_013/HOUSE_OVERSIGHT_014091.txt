PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

Plaintiffs, Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, by through their undersigned
attorneys, move to compel production of documents relevant to this action that defendant Alan
M. Dershowitz has refused to produce.

Dershowitz has told numerous media sources that he has collected documents that
provide “absolute proof” that he has not sexually abused a minor woman known as “Jane Doe
No. 3.” And yet despite having received a valid discovery request for these and other related
documents more than 45 days ago, Dershowitz has refused to produce these documents to
Edwards and Cassell. Indeed, he has refused to produce any documents to them. Accordingly,
the Court should direct Dershowitz to produce these materials forthwith, as well as order him to
pay reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees necessitated by his refusal to make any appropriate

document production.
