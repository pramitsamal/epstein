- Lower regulatory constraints versus peers present opportunity. Given C’s strong
regulatory position such as its above peer SLR ratio, management noted that it can
compete in balance sheet intensive businesses such as Rates while more
constrained peers are forced to pull back. In terms of its ability to take market share
away from European banks, management noted that European banks are more likely
to cede share in Fixed Income and less so within Equity and Banking.

« Longer term goal of 14% ROTCE in ICG. Management believes that under a more
normalized rate environment and through its work towards improving efficiencies
across ICG on back of its infrastructure refinements, ICG should be able to achieve a
14% ROTCE vs ~12% today.
