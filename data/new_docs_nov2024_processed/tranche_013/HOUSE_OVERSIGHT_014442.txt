It is a decent global growth picture and it is not impossible to imagine it being still
better should the US surprise on the upside and the impact on trade from a Trump
presidency prove to be modest.

It certainly fits with the Peak Deflation theme since this stronger growth is expected to
be accompanied by a pick-up in inflation. We have core PCE in the US reaching 1.9%
next year in our core scenario. Our headline inflation numbers are higher because of the
expected increase in the oil price from our commodity strategists. Indeed with oil
expected to reach $60pb (OPEC permitting) headline CPI inflation in the US could push
3%. In the Euro Area we see headline inflation rising to 1.2%, albeit with core inflation
only nudging modestly higher. UK inflation is expected to move markedly higher care of
the lower pound, again with headline inflation pushing towards 3%. In Japan driven by
our more optimistic view of the economy we project core CPI at 1%.

Politics - does populism strike again, this time in Europe?

Few would have predicted both Brexit and a Trump win in 2016. Both had something to
do with the Peak Inequality and Peak Globalisation themes. Politicians on both sides of
the Atlantic tapped into a deep disquiet, particularly amongst white male blue collar
voters that they were not benefitting from this new globalised world. If opinion polls are
to be believed (something which we have all learnt to question) then Italy may well end
the year with another vote against the governing party - although that one is perhaps a
little more complicated to dissect. We recently added a put spread on the eurostoxx to
hedge against such a bad outcome here, which would be the case if it is perceived to be
