supportive of the 5 star movement or threatened the recapitalisation of the Italian
banks (see Strategy Insights: Italy risks elevated).

In 2017 the focus turns to core Europe, especially France and Germany. Because of the
winner takes all system in France we find investors are more concerned with the
situation there. Marine Le Pen and the Front National look likely to make it to the
second round of voting (again according to polls) and until the vote comes in we suspect
investors will be cautious about European markets. A Le Pen victory could likely bring
the future of the EU and the Euro into question as she has talked about France
withdrawing from both. That in turn has arguably the potential to be even more of an
earthquake for the world’s financial markets. Our central case is that centre right
President is elected in France (with Francois Fillon now the official Republican
candidate) and Merkel is returned at the head of a coalition government in Germany.

Were this to be the case then we think there may well be room for a significant relief
rally in European assets. Until then we think it likely investors will demand a higher risk
premium.

Brexit was the big political topic for Europe going into 2016. Going forward we see it as
an ongoing issue but mostly for the UK. The political uncertainty is likely to be extended,
even after Article 50 is triggered as any significant negotiations probably need to await
the outcome of the French and German elections. We expect the UK economy to
struggle as the lagged effect of the fall in the currency hurts consumers and while there
may be contrarian trades available in the GBP during 2017, our strategists think it goes
lower first on the triggering of Article 50.
