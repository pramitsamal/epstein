We have examined labor productivity growth
rates and, as shown in Exhibit 13, find even
lower correlations.

There are two issues to consider. First, if the
reported productivity growth rates are accurate,
then the exceptionally low rates of the last 10 years
account for part of the slow pace of this recovery.
However, the current low productivity growth rates
do not portend low growth rates going forward.
Just as Hansen was proven wrong on his secular
stagnation theory and Krugman was proven wrong
on his diminished expectations for the US economy
(and they were both influenced by their pessimistic
view on productivity), those who extrapolate
stagnation from the current productivity trends
may be proven wrong as well.

Second, as we discuss below, there is also a high
probability that real GDP may be mismeasured.

If real GDP is mismeasured, it follows that

If real GDP is mismeasured, it follows
that productivity is also mismeasured,
thereby invalidating the whole theory of
secular stagnation and the decline of the

US economy.

productivity is also mismeasured, thereby
invalidating the whole theory of secular stagnation
and the decline of the US economy.

Mismeasurement of GDP Statistics
In addition to the productivity debate, there is
a debate as to whether we are measuring GDP
correctly in the first place. The key argument being
made is that while we correctly measure the value
of nominal GDP based on the value of goods and
services, we mismeasure the value of real GDP
when we convert nominal GDP to real GDP using
various price indices, and this therefore understates
the pace of this recovery. This debate garnered
considerable attention in 2016.

The mismeasurement argument states that
the official price indices do not adequately reflect
significant improvements in many products,
especially in information and communication
technology, due to the methodology
used by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) and the BEA. If the
price indices do not adequately
reflect the greater capacity of
an improved product such as a
smartphone or a microprocessor,
then the price index used to convert
nominal GDP to real GDP is too
high. And if the price index is too
high, then real GDP is understated.
