Exhibit 17: Labor Productivity Growth for

Rapid productivity growth of firms at the frontier of
innovation is not spreading to the rest of the industry.

the rest of the industry. Baily and Montalbano
suggest that increased regulation after the crisis
may be partially responsible for the widening gap
between frontier firms and the rest of the industry,
which lowers overall productivity growth rates
across the economy and hence lowers the pace of
economic growth.

Our colleagues in GIR think that lower capital
investment accounts for the lack of diffusion of
new technologies from more productive firms to
less productive firms.** Here, again, it is likely that
a more favorable business environment could have
boosted capital expenditures and increased overall
productivity levels.

We conclude that it is reasonable to assign
some of the weakness in this recovery to less
effective fiscal and regulatory policies out of
Washington rather than to structural shortcomings
in the US economy.

A Steady Onslaught of External Shocks

A sixth theory posits that numerous external
shocks explain the slow pace of this recovery.

Just as the US economy was recovering from the
trough of 2009, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis
jolted global financial markets. The Eurozone

was a source of uncertainty and financial market
volatility beyond the initial shock in 2010 as the

crisis spread from Greece to Spain and Italy.

The Eurozone crisis was followed by a series
of what the Brookings Institution has called the
“fiscal fights of the Obama administration.” The
first fiscal fight resulted in the Standard and Poor’s
(S&P) downgrade of US Treasury debt in August
2011. The equity markets, as measured by the S&P
500 Index, dropped about 19% between April and
October of 2011.

Taken together, the Eurozone sovereign debt
crisis and the first of the fiscal fights tightened
US financial conditions*®® by 142 basis points (see
Exhibit 18). GIR estimates that a 100 basis point
tightening of financial conditions is equivalent to a
federal funds hike of 150 basis points and a drag
on GDP growth of about one percentage point.

The drop in oil prices from a post-crisis high
of $107 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate
in June 2014 to a trough of $26 per barrel in
February 2016 also provided a shock to the
economy. Employment and capital expenditures
in the oil and gas sector dropped by 29% and
67%, respectively, from peak levels seen in 2014.
The sector’s par-weighted default rate excluding
distressed exchanges reached 14.6% and including
such exchanges 19.8%, in October 2016.°!

and unexpected depreciation of the renminbi were
