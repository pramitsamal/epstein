another shock to the financial markets, resulting

in the tightening of financial conditions in the

US in mid-2015 and early 2016, with US equities

dropping by more than 10% in both periods.
Exhibit 19 provides a time line of shocks,

which, in all likelihood, dampened the pace of the

US recovery.

In Summary

As we review the six theories that could account
for the notably slow pace of this recovery, we
believe that all have some merit. Recovering

from the hangover from the deepest recession
since the Great Depression took a little longer.
Demographics have not been favorable.
Productivity growth appears lower, but that fact
does not portend weak productivity growth in the
future. Productivity growth is also probably not as
weak as it appears, given some mismeasurement
of GDP. Fiscal and regulatory policies hampered
the economic recovery. And the global backdrop
provided a steady source of shocks that slowed
growth in the US.

That said, we feel confident that the US
continues to progress on a solid footing, that the
recovery is intact and, as we argued in our 2016
Outlook: The Last Innings, that this recovery and

bull market have another inning or two left to run.

The glass is still half-full.
We now turn to our expected returns for the
next one and five years.

One- and Five-Year Expected
Total Returns

The Investment Strategy Group began producing
one- and five-year annualized expected total
returns for major asset classes in our 2013
Outlook. Since then, our key message has been
to stay invested in US equities despite the low
returns we have expected for the asset class.

Our recommendation has been driven by a low
probability of recession, a reasonable probability
of upside for equities, zero expected returns for
cash and negative expected returns for bonds.

We have presented these one- and five-year
annualized expected returns to: a) provide more
context for our investment recommendations; b)
encourage our clients to have a longer investment
horizon; and c) increase the odds that our clients
have greater staying power to withstand market
downdrafts.

Fulfilling these three priorities is even
more imperative moving forward. Our return
expectations are lower than in prior years after
several years of outsized returns in equities
and high yield, and, at the same time, we are
confronted with tremendous economic policy and
geopolitical uncertainty. We have been faced with
such uncertainty in the past, but today (in contrast
with periods such as 2008), we no longer have the
wind at our back with the benefit of cheap equity
and high yield valuations. In 2008, we believed
that attractive valuations would eventually lead to
high prospective returns in US equities and high
