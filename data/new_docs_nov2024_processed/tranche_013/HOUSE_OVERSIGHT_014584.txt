This bull market is already quite old by historical
standards, second in length only to the almost 10-
year period that preceded the technology bubble
in 2000. Moreover, valuations now stand in their
10th decile, indicating they have been cheaper

at least 90% of the time historically. In the past,
starting from such a high base has led to muted
equity returns over the subsequent five years, with
only a third of those episodes generating a profit
(see Exhibit 47).

Even so, high valuations should not be
confused with certainty of loss, especially over
short periods. As seen in Exhibit 48, today’s
equity multiples tell us very little about potential
gains over the next year, explaining only 5% of
their variation historically. Moreover, history
teaches us that a strategy of selling equities based
solely on expensive valuations has been a losing
approach over time. As we noted in our 2014
Outlook, research conducted by three professors
at the London Business School concluded that

Investors have ridden this bull market

for eight years, and while we don’t
expect the ride to end in 2017, we

must stay vigilant to avoid the horns.

underweighting equities based exclusively on high
valuations underperformed a strategy of remaining
invested across every one of the 20 countries and
three country aggregates they examined.' In
short, valuations alone are a poor tactical timing
signal. Indeed, the S&P 500 has returned more
than 36% since first entering its 9th valuation
decile in November 2013, a time when many

were already suggesting that US equities were

in a bubble.

Valuations must also be considered in
the context of the prevailing macroeconomic
environment. Consider that periods of low and
stable inflation, such as we expect for the year
ahead, have supported higher valuations in the past
(see Exhibit 49). The same could be said for lower
taxes and deregulation—were they to materialize
later this year—as both would boost real returns
on invested capital and justify higher equity values.
Similarly, today’s structurally lower interest rates—
reflecting slower population and productivity
growth—reduce the rate at which
all future cash flows are discounted,
increasing their present value.

Here, it’s helpful to remember that the
S&P 500’s long-term average P/E ratio—
which many investors use to gauge
fair value—was forged over a period
when risk-free rates averaged 4.5%. In
contrast, the risk-free rate now is just
0.5-0.75% and the Federal Reserve
