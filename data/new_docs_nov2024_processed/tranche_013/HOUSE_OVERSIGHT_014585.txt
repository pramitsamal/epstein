estimates its new long-run equilibrium level has
fallen to 3%, a full 1.5 percentage points below
the historical average.'°’ Of equal importance, the
Federal Reserve is not expected to reach that 3%
target for six years based on current market pricing
in Eurodollar futures.

A similar valuation tailwind emerges from the
market’s current sector composition. The combined
technology and health-care sectors constitute about
40% of S&P 500 earnings today, almost three
times as high as their 15% share in the late 1980s.
Because these faster-growing, higher-margin sectors
are generally accorded premium valuations, their
higher representation in the index today justifies a
higher S&P 500 P/E multiple.

Although current valuations may be
fundamentally justified, that does not mean
they are impervious to downward pressure. Our
central-case equity view for 2017 acknowledges
this, calling for some contraction in P/E multiples
given the uncertainty associated with a new
administration and continued Federal Reserve
interest rate hikes. Even so, that headwind will be
more than offset by the 6-10% earnings growth
we forecast, resulting in a 1-5% total return for US
equities this year (see Exhibit 50).

Investors might rightly ask whether it is worth
bearing equity risk for such meager returns. Our
read of the evidence suggests it is. The linchpin
of this view is our expectation of a continued
