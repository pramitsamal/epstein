footprint—75% of sales come from outside the
UK economy—should benefit from the accelerating
global GDP growth we expect this year, just

as this exposure profited from last year’s 16%
depreciation of the British pound (see Exhibit

65). Second, last year’s best-performing sectors—
commodities and financials—are well positioned
to extend their run. Financials—the largest UK
sector—stands to benefit from rising interest rates,
while the commodity sectors should get a boost
from higher oil prices. Notably, these two sectors
account for nearly half of FTSE 100 market
capitalization.

With these tailwinds in mind, we forecast UK
earnings growth of 11% this year, the highest of
our estimates across EAFE markets. That said,
continued uncertainty around the implications
of Brexit coupled with higher interest rates will
likely weigh on FTSE 100’s well-above-average
valuations. This view, combined with the UK equity
market’s hefty dividend yield of 4.0%, results in a
4% total return projection for the FTSE 100.

Although this return is attractive on its face,

We project UK earnings growth of
11% this year, the highest of our
estimates across EAFE markets.

we do not believe it offers investors a large enough
margin of safety to justify a tactical overweight.
Keep in mind that significant uncertainties remain
around the final contours of Brexit. Moreover,

a shift by the Bank of England toward raising
interest rates this year could reverse much of the
British pound’s depreciation, to the detriment of
UK earnings. Finally, FTSE 100’s global footprint
could magnify any disruption to global trade
volumes resulting from protectionist policies.

Japanese Equities: Scaling a Familiar Peak

Japanese equities have experienced their fair share
of booms and busts over the last 25 years. As seen
in Exhibit 66, this pattern of offsetting swings has
resulted in a “fat and flat”!* trading range. With
the TOPIX price level again in the upper third of
its historical band, it is natural to ask whether
2017 will mark yet another market top in Japan.
The earnings outlook is pivotal to answering
this question. While our forecast for accelerating
global GDP growth points toward higher
earnings, near-peak profit margins are
a headwind (see Exhibit 67). Moreover,
with less central bank easing given the
BOJ’s already sizable balance sheet, yen
depreciation—a key driver of Japanese
revenue growth since 2012—is expected

to moderate this year. Even so, the
