1Q investment thesis

We think the Street is underestimating ’17 EPS upside potential from Energy recovery
given the segment’s close correlation to N.A. rig count and short-cycle nature of the
business, as well as incremental accretion from Wayne acquisition. DOV is expected to
host an analyst dinner on January 12 which will provide a 4Q update and preview 2017
results. We think the meeting will be a positive catalyst for the stock, providing more
visibility on Energy orders post-OPEC meeting, highlighting sustainability of the EMV
cycle in Wayne into ’19. Investors will also likely get an update on execution turnaround
in the Refrigeration business, removing one of the biggest overhangs on the stock.

Deregulation/Gov't Legislation:

We expect Trump’s administration to prioritize US energy independence, with
deregulation benefiting domestic shale produces, which should be an attractive tailwind
to DOV’s Energy segment.

Tax Policy:

Our estimates are based on 29% tax rate in ‘17/18. We calculate that under Ryan’s
proposed plan, we can see about 19% upside to EPS. We estimate that under Trump’s
proposed plan, we can see about 24% upside to EPS.

Catalysts:

January 12 — investor dinner with management
January 26 — 4Q results

Rig count release

count going up, LIl read-across

1Q risks: With so much of DOV’s EPS upside tied to Energy segment recovery, we view
oil price volatility (from stronger USS or other unexpected macro headlines) as the
biggest risk to our thesis. Weaker-than-expected execution in Refrigeration or Fluid
business would be another risk, offsetting Energy upside.
