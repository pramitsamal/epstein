Core inflation at 0.8% is barely above the 2015 low of 0.6%. One statistic that often
grabs attention is the high proportion of HICP index components recording deflation
(currently 31% on a weighted basis). However, much of this represents volatile non-core
components so is less of a concern. The bigger problem is the fact that even after we
take out all these components recording deflation, the 69% of the index remaining is
only recording a weighted average inflation rate of 1.3%. Chart 26 shows that the more
serious problem is that only 10% of components in the basket are recording inflation
rates above the 2% target. So there is a “lowflation” clustering problem by index item
and Chart 27 shows that there is also a lowflation clustering problem by country. In fact,
the country clustering is even more concentrated than it looks if we allow for the fact
that the bigger of the two upside outliers, Belgium (1.8% inflation), has experienced a
presumably unrepeatable increase in the tax rate on electricity from 6% to 21%, as well
as other excise duty increases.

One might be tempted to give the Eurozone the benefit of the doubt on inflation,
insofar as its output gap remains material. However, the closure of the output gap still
requires strong and continuing stimulus, we would argue, and even that does not
guarantee that somehow inflation resets to target.

Our worry about item and country lowflation clustering is not that inflation is
“unanchored”. Our concern is that it flags a “re-anchoring” of inflation at a level well
below 2% and that this new anchor will prove difficult to dislodge.
