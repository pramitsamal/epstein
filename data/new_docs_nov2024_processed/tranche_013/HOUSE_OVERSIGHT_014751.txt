10s would be particularly supported if the ECB increases the holding limit of non-CaC
bonds to 50% — a tweak we see as the most likely. Also, given the already stretched
valuations in the 2y, we think a rise in geopolitical risks or a blow-out in peripheral
spreads would increase collateral values of 5s and 10s more than the front-end — as
happened during the first BTP spread widening in 2011 or the Brexit referendum.

We recommend investors go long the DBR Aug26 vs OIS and short the BKO Dec18
vs OIS at current levels of -17bp, targeting 14bp and with a stop at -34bp. The
position has 1.1bp in 3m Carry and Roll. The main risk in the short term is ECB QE
failure, while tighter short-maturity securities supply or lending is the main risk over the
longer term.
