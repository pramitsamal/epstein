Bullish USD/JPY

The election of Donald Trump catapulted USD/JPY through another resistance level, this
time a weekly trend line, adding to the list of technical signals that USD/JPY has
bottomed and is in an uptrend. We began discussing a bottom in our September 5 and
September 18 Technical Advantage reports. We estimate technical upside and
resistance in the area of 112. We also think this uptrend has the potential to reach the
full measured move target of 116.50 in 2017.

A higher yield environment
We continue to think yields will trend higher in 2017. We initially reported our view that

global yields would rise in our October 26 Technical Advantage report. Since then we
have seen added confirmation by US 10y, US 30y, 10yr bund, 30yr JGB and 10y Gilt that
yields will rise.

US 10y and 30y yield form wedge bottom pattern

US 10y and 30y yields formed wedge bottom patterns by breaking through the upper
trend line resistance (Breakout 1). A wedge pattern is composed of two converging
trend lines often consisting of multiple smaller trends followed by a breakout. Each yield
has a second resistant trend line and Fibonacci retracement to break. If 10y yield breaks
through 2.35% and 30y yield through 3.15%, then another breakout will have occurred
that technically triggers another leg higher to 2.98% and 3.80%, respectively. We think
this is the more likely outcome.
