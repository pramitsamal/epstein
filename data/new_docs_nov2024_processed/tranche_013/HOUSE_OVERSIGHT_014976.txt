Chart 7: A combination of upward trending global equity markets and
very low volatility have conspired to push trend following (CTA) equity
positioning to near record levels. Consequently, the beta of CTA
strategies to global equities is also at extreme levels

Unlevered BofAML Model Risk Parity Volatility (LHS)

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. Based on daily data from 3-Jan-72 through 16-Jun-17.
Equity, fixed income, and commodity components within the hypothetical risk parity investment are
represented by the S&P500, 10-Year US Treasury Bonds, and the S&P GSCI Index, respectively. Risk
parity allocations are determined and rebalanced monthly using prior 12-month realized volatility
and correlations.

It is important to note that not all CTA, risk parity, or vol control strategies operate
similarly and there is model risk in estimating the exact size of these trading flows.

FMS avg cash balance (%) — S&P 500 (RHS)

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Fund Manager Survey, Bloomberg. As a reminder, the FMS Cash
Rule works as follows: when average cash balance rises above 4.5% a contrarian buy signal is
generated for equities. When the cash balance falls below 3.5% a contrarian sell signal is generated.

Extract risk-limited alpha from SPX range via cheap in-the-money knockout puts

As a risk-limited range trade, we like owning down-and-out puts on SPX that are already
in-the-money. For example, the SPX Sep 2475 put with a 2300 knock-out (continuous
observation) indicatively costs 7Obps (spot ref 2451) and offers a 60% discount to the

vanilla 2475/2300 put spread, which is itself historically cheap (Chart 12).

If SPX stays above the 2300 barrier at all points in time before expiry, the structure is
equivalent to a 2475 put option. If the barrier is instead breached, the maximum loss
will be equal to the (low) upfront premium. The 2300 barrier is about 6% out-of-the-
money, hence “allows” for the elusive 5% correction not seen since Brexit (on a closing
basis). However, investors can mitigate the risk of breaching the barrier by either
moving it farther down (e.g., a 2245 barrier would indicatively raise the cost from 0.7%
to 1%}, or by only observing it on a close-to-close basis (in turn sacrificing part of the

discount).
