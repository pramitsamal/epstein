The trade prices attractively today due to exceptionally steep SPX put skew, which is
near its highs established since 2004 (Chart 11). With steep SPX put skew, the market
is implicitly pricing in a high probability that the option will knock-out during its life, i-e.,
that relatively large drawdowns are more likely. As detailed above, however, we see
many reasons why the most likely near-term scenario for US equities is to remain
range-bound. The structure is short 11% delta at inception and has the same vega
sensitivity as the equivalent put spread (short 6bps).

Chart 11: SPX put skew is near the all-time highs reached since 2002. Chart 12: The price of SPX put spreads is already near the lows reached
Steep skew helps cheapen knockout puts as the market is implying a since 2002. In particular, the price of a 3m 50d-25d put spread is
relatively high probability of the barrier being breached ~1.02%, in the 0.15 %-ile since Nov-02
