Notable trends and dislocations (Asia)

Most regions in Asia reported modest declines last week, led by Hong Kong’s HSCEI,
which lost 2.0% week-over-week. Much of the decline came on Thursday following the
US Fed’s decision to hike rates 25bps. Also in China, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)
injected 410bn yuan (about $60bn) into the financial system via reverse-repos, the
largest cash boost since January. The central bank said the funds are meant to ease
concern amid a seasonal funding squeeze. The biggest contributors to the index’s loss
were financials names, including China Life Insurance (2628 HK), which fell 5.7%, Ping
An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (2318 HK}, which dropped 3.7%, Bank of China Ltd
(3988 Hk), which declined 1.8%, and China Merchants Bank Co Ltd (3968 Hk), which fell
5.7%. We saw a similar decline from Hong Kong’s HSI index, which lost 1.6% percent
last week.

After the HSCEI and HSI, last week’s biggest losers were Korea’s KOSPI and India’s
NIFTY, which each returned -0.8% week-over-week. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 0.3%. On
Friday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) left its monetary policy unchanged—it will continue to
control the yield curve via its negative benchmark rate and its asset purchasing program.
The final region to report a loss last week was Taiwan’s TWSE, which lost 0.4%.

On the other hand, the only region to see a gain last week was Australia, which saw its
ASX 200 benchmark increase 1.7% week-over-week. The biggest contributors to the
gain were Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA AU}, which gained 3.4%, Westpac
Banking Corp (WBC AU), which increased 1.9%, and CSL Ltd (CSL AU), which added
2.9%.
