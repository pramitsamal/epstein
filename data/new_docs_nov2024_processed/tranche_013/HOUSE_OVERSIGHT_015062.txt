reputation had spread by word-of-mouth, and he was known as “The
Saint.” Patients came to his clinic in Ashland from around the country.

| took the five-hour bus trip from New York to Ashland with my
gigantic Webcor tape recorder. Dr. Spencer was the cheerful
personification of an old-fashioned physician. He wore a red beret and
used folksy expressions like “by golly.”. He had been performing
abortions for 40 years. He started out charging $5, and never more than
$100. He rarely used the word pregnant. Rather, he would say, “She was
that way, and she came to me for help.”

Ashland was a small town, and Dr. Spencer's work was not merely
tolerated; the community depended on it--the hotel, the restaurant, the
dress shop—-all thrived on the extra business that came from his out-of-
town patients. However, he built facilities at his clinic for African-American
patients who weren't allowed to obtain overnight lodgings elsewhere. The
walls of his office were decorated with those little wooden signs that
tourists like to buy. A sign on the ceiling over his operating table said Keep
Calm.

Here’ san excerpt from our dialogue:

Q. Do you have any idea about how many actual abortions you’ re

performed during all these years?
