My favorite response came from Merriman Smith, the syndicated
UPI correspondent who always ended White House press conferences with
the traditional “Thank you, Mr. President.” He wrote:

“One of the filthiest printed attacks ever made on a President of
the United States is now for sale on Washington newsstands. The target:
President Johnson. This is the May edition of a so-called magazine which
says it is entered as second class mail. One newsstand owner says sales of
this particular issue have been = ‘quite active.’ This reporter is not
embarked here on any defense of Johnson politically or personally, nor, for
that matter, is this to suggest the need for greater respect for the
presidency.

“These are matters that have been dealt with extensively in other
forums. Certain unadorned facts, however, do stand out in the open
circulation, mailing and other forms of distribution of this sort of slime: Ifa
magazine of major national standing tries to use the same sort of
language, federal action to stop it would be almost certain. The language
referred to is not conventional hell or damn profanity—-it is filth attributed
to someone of national stature supposedly describing something Johnson

allegedly did. The incident, of course, never took place. . .”
