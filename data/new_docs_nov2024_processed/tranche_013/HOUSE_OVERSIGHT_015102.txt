Of all the professional newscasters | have met, Walter Cronkite of
CBS was the most charming. He treated me with respect and dignity. After
the broadcast interview, we sat in his anteroom and talked informally.

“I’ ve always wanted to thank you,” he said, “for inadvertently
bringing me back to sanity that horrible weekend John Kennedy was
killed.”

“Oh, really—how so?”

“This followed on the heels of the televised shooting of Lee Harvey
Oswald by Jack Ruby. A journalist asked for your reaction, and you replied
with a slip of the tongue, ‘Two rights don’ t make a wrong.’ Before you
could correct yourself, | was finally able to break through my depression
with a bit of laughter.”

“Yes, those were muddled times. Do you know | forgot where | was
the day the assassination took place? | had to tell the FBI | couldn’ t
remember, and it was not until later that | remembered | had been in
Dallas, of all places. There was a convention of the American Bottlers of
Carbonated Beverages, and | was there representing Pepsi-Cola. But | flew
out of there at eleven o’ clock that morning. Kennedy was shot around

one o’ clock, as | recall. Where were you that day?”
