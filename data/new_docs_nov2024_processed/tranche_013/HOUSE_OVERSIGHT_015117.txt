6. Knock off Ford before the election by Squeaky Fromme, Sara
Jane Moore, whoever.

7. Replace Ford again with Rockefeller, declare martial law and
cancel the election. Alternatively, this could be done by killing
Jimmy Carter before the inauguration.

Now | realize how naive | was. Granted, Carter is more progressive
than | am—after all, politics is the art of finding a balance between the
status quo and the force of evolution—but it became crystal clear to me
that he had made some kind of deal. The intelligence-gathering system
knew about G. Harrold Carswell’ s tragic gay problem. Now, /e would
have been a fine prospect for blackmail: “We have this photo of you and
a friend in the men’ s room, Justice Carswell, but don’ t worry, we won’ t
leak it.” | wonder, if | had been successful in appointing him to the
Supreme Court, how would he have voted on the constitutionality of
entrapping homosexuals? Anyway, my suspicions were aroused when it did
not come out in the media until after the election—immediately before
Carter’ s inauguration when it was too late to do us any good—that his
son Jack had been discharged from the Navy because of marijuana.

Our hammer over George McGovern’ s head in 1972 was that his
daughter had been hospitalized for an LSD freakout. We never had to
resort to using that particular bit of intelligence, however, despite the fact

that it was wewho had arranged for her to be “dosed” in the first place.
