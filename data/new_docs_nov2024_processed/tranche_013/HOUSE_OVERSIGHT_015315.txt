jury was the testimony of Ralph McGehee, who revealed how he had
been recruited right off the football field by the CIA, only to become
a star player in their assassination-squad program. Members of the
jury would not have voted that way in the sixties because they
weren't prepared to believe such testimony as they are in the
eighties.
In the sixties, we knew that the CIA was smuggling heroin from
Southeast Asia. And in the eighties we know that they're smuggling
cocaine from Central America. The same planes that fly weapons for
the contras to airports in Panama, Honduras and Costa Rica come
back to Florida, Louisiana and Arkansas with their cargoes filled to
the brim with cocaine, even though the administration is carrying on
its anti-drug campaign. The pilots only have to be careful to evade
the radar screen. So while Nancy Reagan is saying, “Just say no,”
the CIA is saying, “Just fly low.”
Meanwhile, the quality of co-option had not been strained. The slogan
“Today is the first day of the rest of your life’ was used in a TV
commercial for Total breakfast cereal. Tampax promoted its tampon as
“Something over thirty you can trust.” Beatles songs were used to sell
cars, or, if you preferred to walk, they also sold sneakers. 7ime magazine
was being peddled by the Byrds’ version of Pete Seeger's song, “Turn,
Turn, Turn” --based on Ecclesiastes—t here's a time for this and a time for
that, get it?
The Youngbloods once sent a copy of their song “Get Together”

to every member of Congress and the Senate, with a suggestion that it be

established as the new national anthem, but who could ever have guessed
