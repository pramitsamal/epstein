Meantime, since gays and lesbians have waited so long for basic
fairness, they might as well just wait for the next election. If you win, then
would you kindly do immediately what you believe is right, constitutionally
and in your heart, and end this injustice? The ultimate irony is that gays in
the military are fighting, being maimed and dying unnecessarily,
supposedly to protect the freedom their own country is denying them.

Sincerely,
Paul Krassner
Postscript:

| sent a copy of the letter to some folks that day. Among the
responses, | received a message from a mother: “I am trying to explain
this to my twelve-year-old son, who wants to know why, if men and
women don’ t share barracks in the military, why gay men and hetero
men should share barracks, but then follows with ‘They should all sleep in
the same place.’ 

And that evening | received this email from a seasoned journalist: “I
know it's late, but | cannot wait to ask if this letter is a spoof, or you've
actually sent it to Obama. If it's a spoof and you've not sent it to him,
would you like to? I've got his fax number and he's got a great sense of

humor. May | have your permission to send this to him?”

“Absolutely.”
