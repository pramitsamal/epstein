state under oath that I did not have sex with her,
thereby opening myself up --

MR. EDWARDS: This again is nonresponsive

to the question.

SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: Let me stop --

repeat the question so we can get an answer.

BY MR. EDWARDS:

Q. The question is, were you sent a waiver of
the statute of limitations to sign so that Virginia
Roberts could bring that lawsuit? Were you?

A. I don't believe that's right. I don't
believe that's right. I don't believe that I was
sent a -- something that would give her the
opportunity -- a waiver to file that lawsuit.
That's not my recollection. If you show it to me,
maybe my recollection will be refreshed.

I had talked about the statute of
limitations for criminal purpose was what I said,
that I would waive the statute of limitations for
criminal purposes. If a prosecutor were to
investigate this case and come to the conclusion
that there was probable cause that I had committed
any offense with Virginia Roberts, I would then

waive the statute of limitations.
