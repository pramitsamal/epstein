of symptoms and it will spit out a range of possible alternative diagnoses
with probability weightings and suggested further tests. Similar systems
are widely deployed in other fields, to build racing cars, design dams
and fight crime. Even the game consoles in our living rooms implement
artificial intelligence to make the aliens more believable and our hearts
pump faster.

Origin of Computers

Alan Turing effectively invented the modern day computer in a paper
he submitted to the London Mathematical Society in the summer
of 1936. He was not the first person to come up with the idea — that
honor probably goes to Charles Babbage — but he was the first to fully
understand its power. When we talk about computers today we mean
machines, but it is worth noting computers in Turing’s time were more
often humans using pencil and paper. The mechanical computers before

Turing were elementary at best.

Rudimentary calculating machines were developed in Greece,
Persia and China as far back as the Ming Dynasty. An astrolabe recovered
froma ship wreck off the Greek Island of Antikythera had cogs and gears
and could accurately predict the motions of the sun and planets. Many
