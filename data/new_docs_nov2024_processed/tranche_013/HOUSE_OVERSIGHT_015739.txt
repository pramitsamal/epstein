Creative Theories

nce I have exercised my free will by getting out of bed in the

morning, I often decide to do something creative. Humans seem

driven to create. We compose music, draw, paint, and solve
mathematical puzzles. Computers are not naturally creative; they spend
most of their time doing exactly the opposite — following preset rules. Is
this a fundamental limitation distinguishing the computational world
from the real world?

The Conventional View

Most scientists believe pattern-matching algorithms in the brain allow
us to be creative. To see how this might work, imagine our brains are
chaotic — not hard to do — and process many competing ideas at the same
time. The neurons in our brains build millions of useful, and useless,
connections based on the patterns in the data we see and hear. Then a
selection process goes to work — something akin to natural selection — to
sift and prune the connections until something bubbles to the surface
and we get that, ‘aha’ feeling.

Douglas Hofstadter, Professor of Cognitive Science at Indiana
University, famous for the book Gédel Escher Bach, has written a computer
program using pattern matching to discover number theorems; things
like any number ending in a zero is divisible by 5. The program produces
interesting results, even perhaps generating some new theorems. He
argues the human brain is essentially a scaled up version of his program.
By the way, if you like trivia, his book Fluid Concepts & Creative Analogies
was the first book ever sold on Amazon.com.
