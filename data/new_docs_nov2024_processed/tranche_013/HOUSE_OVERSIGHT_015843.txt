Notice I not only prove I am not guilty I also prove the opposite:
I am innocent. When a mathematician uses this trick, it is called an
indirect proof and works the same way as the alibi. Assume the opposite
is true of some theory you want to prove (I am guilty). If it generates a
contradiction or paradox (can't be in two places at once) you can deduce
the opposite must be true (innocence). Mathematicians use this all the
time. It assumes, of course, mathematics is consistent and that true and
false are opposites.

Some mathematicians argue this is too strong an assumption. Why
should we assume consistency and recognize only two logical states, true
and false? These mathematicians believe the only way to prove a theorem
is with positive argument rather than using the opposite of a negative
argument. They don't allow indirect proofs in their mathematical
models. This type of mathematics is unsurprisingly called positivism. It’s
a pure theory but, unfortunately, if you try to follow it you lose much of
our current mathematical knowledge and understanding. Most modern
mathematicians think it a historical curiosity, but it does pop up from
time to time. Modern mathematics is founded on the axioms that
true and false are the opposite of each other and that inconsistency is
forbidden within the system. Mathematical proofs submitted to journals
are not permitted to contain inconsistencies or result in paradoxes.

Paradoxes - When Logic Fails

“T would not be a member of
any club that would admit

me.
Groucho Marx

Paradoxes occur when a state-
ment makes no sense, or results
in an internal contradiction as
with Groucho Marx’s famous
quote. They are widely used in
mathematics to implement indi-
rect proofs. To do this, we sup-
pose something is true, and if
it results in a paradox then the
