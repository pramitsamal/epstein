Warning: Don’t spend too long on these problems.

The reason I warned you not to spend too long is that solving the
50-city problem would take longer than the age of the known universe.
NP problems get harder very fast as the number of elements goes up. A
50-city problem is hugely larger than a five-city problem, not just ten
times harder.

The Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a $1 million prize for
anyone who can say whether NP problems are really as hard as they
appear. It may be there is a general trick or a series of tricks that allow
you to solve any NP problem in a shorter time. If you could do this, the
problem would be demoted to P, allowing fast computers to tackle it. No
one has yet found a proof of the P=NP problem. At the time of writing
several proofs are sitting with the Clay Prize judges but don’t hold your
breath. Most people assume there is no solution. If you want to have a
crack at the problem let me state it in simple terms.
