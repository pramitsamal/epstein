190 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

repeat. To create the random number in my example above I went to www.
random.org, a website that uses fluctuations in atmospheric quantum
noise to generate random numbers. As far as we know quantum effects
are truly random and have neither rhyme nor reason.

Numbers are more complex than they first appear. They are infinite,
yet there are different infinities, and they have meaning. The smallpox
example above and the Turing numbers we will discover shortly suggest
numbers do have meaning independent of culture and language. The
next two chapters will show us what happens when we think about the
meaning of numbers. We will also explain one more ‘super infinity’ and
this will be the key to understanding creativity.

“There are known knowns; there
are things we know we know.
We also know there are known
unknowns; that is to say we
know there are some things we
do not know. But there are also
unknown unknowns - the ones
we dont know we don't know.”
