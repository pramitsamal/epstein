Fork in the Road

“When making a decision of
minor importance, I have
always found it advantageous
to consider all the pros and cons.
In vital matters, however, such
as the choice of a mate or a
profession, the decision should
come from the unconscious,
from somewhere within
ourselves. In the important
decisions of personal life, we
should be governed, I think, by
the deep inner needs of our
nature.”

Alan Turing
