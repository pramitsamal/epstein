Commodities: NTP adds to medium-term oil
market tightness

The Saudi National Transformation Plan (NTP) suggestion that production capacity is to
be maintained at the current level until 2020 reinforces our conviction of medium-term
oil market tightness. We continue to see a call on OPEC of 4.1mn bpd in the next five
years to “balance the market”, and see oil prices of US$55-75/bbl over 2016-2020.
Although the NTP incorporates a target of boosting domestic gas production by 50% to
18 bcf/d by 2020 which could crowd out oil demand, we expect Saudi Arabia’s ability to
switch to reduce oil burn in power generation to 2020 to be quite limited, in our view.

We see oil averaging US$55-75/bbl over 2016-2020

Real Brent prices are at one of the lowest levels in decades, and will likely encourage
very strong demand growth ahead, while we see supply falling across non-cartelized
producers. As such, we see global light sweet crude oil averaging US$55 to USS75/bbl
over the 2016-2020 period, depending on how much incremental production OPEC can
and will supply over the next five years. We think it likely that Saudi will dig into its
untested spare capacity to go for increased market share, though uncertainty over how
much Saudi can and will produce remains. We also remain concerned about output
sustainability among weaker cartel members given the rapid credit profile deterioration.
