Non-OPEC production will not reach 2015 levels before 2020 at the earliest...
Non-OPEC producers have massively reduced capex spending, down US$290bn or 42%
from 2014 to 2016, in response to the low price environment. Should capex start to
increase again in 2017, the effect on non-OPEC non-shale production is unlikely to be
felt before 2020 at the earliest. Most of the decline in the short term comes from non-
conventional output in the US, as shale is very price sensitive within a 12-month
horizon. With Brent prices set to increase from US$46/bbl this year to US$80/bbI in
2020 in our base case, we believe US shale production will grow again, albeit at a slower
rate than in the past four years. Total non-OPEC supply is set to drop to 56.4mn bpd in
2017 before rebounding to 57.5 mn bpd in 2020, a similar level as in 2015.

Chart 36: With Brent prices set to increase to US$80/bbl in 2020, we Chart 37: Linking this with our 5-year price deck suggests marginal US
believe US shale output will grow again, albeit at a slower rate shale output grows in 2017 and acceleration thereafter

4.1mn bpd needs to be added by OPEC by 2020, namely Saudi, Iran and Iraq

The US is the only country able to ramp up production among non-cartelized players by
2020, so OPEC has to come to the rescue to provide the required incremental supplies.
We estimated that demand will grow by 5.9mn bpd in 2015-20. With the market
oversupply of 1.8mn bpd in 2015, OPEC needs to increase production by 4.1mn bpd in
the next five years to “balance the market”. Saudi Arabia could make up for half of this
given its c2mn bpd of spare capacity, and we believe it intends to at least increase its
market share. We would expect other OPEC countries to expand their capacity in the
