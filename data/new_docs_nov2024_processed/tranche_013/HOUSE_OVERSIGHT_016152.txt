Saudi market valuation not testing

The Saudi market has been one of the poorest performing emerging markets year-to-
date, underperforming the MSCI EM indices by approximately 10% (and c20% since
August 2015). A combination of weak oil prices and their inevitable impact on the Saudi
economy including slowing economic growth, rising operational risks and fiscal
consolidation (including subsidy removals) have been the key drivers. The
underperformance has left the market trading on a 12mth P/E of c.13x, an 11% discount
to its long term average and its lowest premium to GEMs since 2010 (Saudi trades on a
7% percent premium vs long run average of c. 30%). Furthermore, Saudi trades on
12mth FWD P/B ratio of 1.5x, a 20% discount to long run averages, but a 15% premium
to GEMs on 1.3x, justified by the market’s higher ROE’s (Saudi’s long term P/B premium
has been c.25%). Finally, Saudi trades on 12mth FWD EV/EBITDA multiples of 9x, a
c.11% discount to long run averages.
