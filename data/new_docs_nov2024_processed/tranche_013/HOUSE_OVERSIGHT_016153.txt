Weaker economic outlook largely priced in as ERR shows inflection

A further consequence of the weakening economic outlook for Saudi Arabia has been
the collapse in market expectations, with earnings estimates having posted their longest
sustained period of downgrades on record. We note however, the Saudi Earnings
Revision Ratio (ERR) has reached an inflection point, with a slowdown in the rate of
earnings downgrades. (ERR is a ratio of number of companies enjoying earnings
upgrades vs number of companies suffering downgrades. A ratio above one, therefore,
indicates more upgrades than downgrades). Consequently, we believe the relatively un-
testing valuations of the Saudi market indicate that a high level of negativity is already
being priced in.
