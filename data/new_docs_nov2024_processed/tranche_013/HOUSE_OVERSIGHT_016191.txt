Zain KSA (XOCTF)

We use a DCF valuation model to derive our price objective of SAR 12.2. Key
assumptions are a discount rate of 11.0%, underpinned by a risk free rate of 5.5%, a
cost of equity of 29% and a 6.5% cost of debt. We explicitly forecast free cash flows
until 2022 and then assume perpetuity growth of 3%, as we do when valuing other Gulf
operators. Our forecasts take in to account the repayment of the deferred royalty loan
afforded to Zain in 2013 (repayments starting from 2021).

Downside risks are greater pricing pressure from MVNOs, the loss of its appeal against
a SAR620mn tax claim, an unfavourable ruling against Zain KSA in its arbitration process
with Mobily and an inability to grow market share and margins, which in turn would
threaten capital requirements.
