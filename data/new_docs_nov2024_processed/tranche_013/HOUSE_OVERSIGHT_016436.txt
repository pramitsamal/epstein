in 2008, witnesses and alleged victims testified in civil court that there were

hundreds of girls who were brought to Epstein’s homes, including girls from

Europe, Latin America and former Soviet Republic countries.

But Acosta and Epstein’s armada of attorneys — Harvard professor Alan
Dershowitz, Jay Lefkowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Jack Goldberger, Roy Black, Guy
Lewis and former Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr — reached a
consensus: Epstein would never serve time in a federal or state prison.

Sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein was surrounded by powerful people. Here’s a sampling

POLICE UNDER PRESSURE

There were really just two people willing to risk their careers to go after Epstein:
Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter and Detective Joseph Recarey.

For Reiter, business tycoon Jeffrey Epstein wasn’t any more formidable than any
of the other 8,000 or so wealthy and powerful people living on the island. Police
had handled sensational cases involving wealthy residents before — from the
murders of heiresses to the rape case involving William Kennedy Smith, of the
Kennedy family.

The easternmost town in Florida, Palm Beach is a 10.4-square-mile barrier island
between the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean populated by some of
the richest people in the country. President Trump has his “winter White House”
in Palm Beach, and the town makes news as much for its glitz as it does for its
unusual efforts to preserve its well-mannered image, like banning shirtless

joggers.

But it was a little surprising, even to Reiter, to learn that one of its residents had a
revolving door of middle and high school girls coming to his gated compound
throughout the day and night.
