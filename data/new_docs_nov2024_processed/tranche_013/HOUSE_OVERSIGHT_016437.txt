In their first on-the-record media interviews about the case, Reiter and Recarey
revealed new details about the investigation, and how they were, in their view,
pressured by then-Palm Beach State Attorney Barry Krischer to downgrade the

case to a misdemeanor or drop it altogether.

Former Palm Beach County Police Detective Joe Recarey was the lead detective on the solicitation-of-minors case

against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.

Between March of 2005 — when the case was opened — and seven months later,
when police executed a search warrant at Epstein’s home, Recarey had identified
21 possible victims, according to a copy of the unredacted police report obtained
by the Herald. By the time police felt they had enough evidence to arrest Epstein
on sex charges, they had identified about 35 possible underage victims and were

tracking down at least a dozen more, the police report said.
