Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08

Mr. Vanneck asked for clarification on what the motion was and Mr. Walton
advised the motion was that the sea grapes must be cut after turtle season, by
November 7, 2008 and if they were not cut by that date, a $250.00 a day fine
would commence on November 8, 2008 and continue until compliance was
achieved.

Mr. Fried asked who the fine would apply to and Mr. Walton said it would be to
the Nightingale Trail Beach Club Association. Mr. Fried asked if this was a legally
constituted body and Mr. Maxey said it was an informal body, that on the deeds,
everyone owns this piece of property in common. There was some additional
discussion on the ordinance. Ms. Van Buren asked if every single property owner
on the street was a member of the association and Mr. Maxey said every property
owner on Nightingale Trail was and there were one or two houses on North Ocean
and North Lake as well. Mr. Maxey said there were 23 separate memberships.
Ms. Van Buren asked about the finances and Mr. Maxey said there were annual
dues of $75.00 a year and a common bank account of $3500 or $3600. Mr.
Maxey said that if a fine was incurred, that is probably where the money would
come from but he did not believe, because of his fiduciary responsibility to the
group, he could fight the decision with any of those monies. Mr. Ochstein asked if
he was an elected officer and Mr. Maxey said he was president and that he keeps
the books and makes sure the place is in good condition.

MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT THE VIOLATOR UNTIL
NOVEMBER 7, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND IF
COMPLIANCE IS NOT ACHIEVED BY THAT DATE, TO ASSESS A
FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF $250.00 A DAY UNTIL COMPLIANCE IS
ACHIEVED
