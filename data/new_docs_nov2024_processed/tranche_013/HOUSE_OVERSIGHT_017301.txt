successfully prosecuted for it by the State Attorney’s Office. The problem was that several years
had passed between the murder and the prosecution and Connolly had a plausible statute of
limitations argument on appeal.

I was asked by State Attorney Rundle to consult with her appellate lawyers and to prepare them
for what they expected would be a grueling oral argument. I agreed and worked with them, and
with federal prosecutors in Boston, on the appellate brief. I also conducted a “moot court” in
which I played judge and asked the hardest questions I could come up with. The “moot court,”
as it turned out, was more grueling than the actual argument, and the prosecution won the appeal.
It was the first time I recall cheering when I heard that the prosecution had won an appeal.

There is nothing more corrosive to the administration of justice than corrupt law enforcement
officials (except, perhaps, corrupt judges, several of whom Billy Bulger had appointed to “his”
bench). The Bulger gang is now history. Whitey and Connolly are in prison, probably for the rest
of their lives. Billy is “retired” from politics, but still widely admired by some in Boston, who
ought to know better.
