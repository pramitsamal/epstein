Moshe Katsav

President Moshe Katsav of Israel asked me to come to see him during the last year of his
presidency. He asked me for advice—political and media advice rather than legal, since I am not
an expert on Israeli law—about the sexual harassment charges he was then facing. He told me
that he had been offered a deal by the prosecutor under which he would plead guilty to an
harassment charge, and the prosecutor would not bring rape charges. I do not feel comfortable
disclosing precisely the advice I gave him, even though it wasn’t legal advice and even though I
was never part of his legal team. All I can say is that if he had followed my advice, I don’t think
he would be in prison today.
