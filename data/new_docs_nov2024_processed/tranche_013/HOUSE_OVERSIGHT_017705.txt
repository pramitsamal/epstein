2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *959

First, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(1), the Advisory Committee has watered down the CVRA's directive that a court must decide any
victim's motion forthwith >4? to promptly. While there is nothing wrong with this change as a matter of style, > it does
appear to reduce the speed with which courts will have to act to enforce victims' rights. Forthwith can be interpreted to be
more exacting requirement than promptly. >44 Given that the Advisory Committee's premise that, where possible, it should

545

incorporate the language of the CVRA, it is unclear why it chose to substitute promptly for the forthwith requirement.

Second, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(2), the Advisory Committee has inexplicably left out the right of the victim's representative to
assert a victim's right (along with [*960] the victim herself and the prosecutor). *4° This omission is criticized earlier in this
Article. *47

Third, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(5)(a) through (c), the Advisory Committee sets out three requirements for a victim to file a
motion to reopen a sentence - requirements taken straight from the CVRA. **% Without explanation, however, the Advisory
Committee then leaves out the CVRA's qualification to these restrictions - this paragraph does not affect the victim's right to
restitution as provided in Title 18, United States Code. °49

Fourth, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(4), the Advisory Committee has left out the CVRA's venue provision which allows a victim to
assert her rights if no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred. °° In contrast
to the other three omissions just noted, the Advisory Committee specifically discussed whether to track the italicized language
in its proposed rule on asserting rights. Remarkably, it decided to take the statutory language out of the Rules:

Judge Levi expressed concern over the final phrase in Rule [60(b)(4)], which gives a victim the right to assert rights if no
prosecution is underway, in the court in the district in which the crime occurred. Judge Jones said the Crime Victims Rights
Act affords victims certain rights even in the absence of a case. Judge Levi noted, however, that the criminal rules only apply to
proceedings in filed cases. Judge Jones explained that the subcommittee had decided to include it because there might be a pre-
prosecution proceeding of some sort to which the provision might apply. There was discussion as to whether a grand jury
investigation might qualify as such. Professor Beale said that, while the Act might give victims certain rights, such as being
treated respectfully, Judge Levi was probably correct that the rights covered by the criminal rules could only be asserted with
respect to a case being prosecuted. After further discussion, Judge Jones said the phrase would be deleted, as Judge Levi had
suggested. >>!

prompt, and with reasonable dispatch.); Ayers v. Coughlin, 530 N.E.2d 373, 375 (N.Y. 1988) (“We reiterate that the statutory mandate to
commit individuals to the officials responsible for their custody forthwith' means that it is done without delay, at once, promptly. Forthwith'
signals immediacy.).
