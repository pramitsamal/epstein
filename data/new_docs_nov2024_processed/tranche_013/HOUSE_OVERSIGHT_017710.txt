2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *966

In response to this Article and to other public criticisms of its rules, the Advisory Committee made several modest changes to
its proposed rules. These changes are discussed in numerical order here. Other than these changes, no significant changes were
made to the proposed rules discussed here. The Advisory Committee has submitted them all to the Supreme Court and, unless
the Court takes the unusual step of disavowing them, they will go into effect on December 1, 2008.

Rule 1. In apparent response to my criticism that the definition of victim found in Rule 1 intentionally excluded a victim's

representative, 78

on April 16, 2007, the Advisory Committee amended its proposed Rule 60 to allow a victim's
representative to assert a right. Rule 60(b)(2) now provides: A victim's rights described in these rules may be asserted by the
victim, the victim's lawful representative, the attorney for the government, or any other person as authorized [*967] by /&
U.S.C. § 3771(d) and (e). >7? This change insures that victims' representatives will be able to assert victims’ rights. The
Advisory Committee also added language to the Committee Note stating that courts could make appropriate findings to resolve

any dispute about who is a victim. *°°

Rule 5. At its October 1, 2007 meeting in Utah, the Advisory Committee approved a proposed change to Rule 5 regarding
detention hearings. The proposed addition to Rule 5 reads: In making the decision to detain or release the defendant, the judge



must consider the right of the victim to be reasonably protected from the defendant. >8! This language was lifted almost

straight from Senator Kyl's proposed legislation implementing the CVRA **? (which is discussed in the next section). This
seems like a valuable addition to the Rules, helping to protect victims' rights in detention decisions.

Rule 12.1. At its April 16, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee apparently agreed with my conclusion that courts lack

authority to force a victim to meet with a defendant >*?

and struck language recommending such a meeting from its Committee
note.

Rule 12.3. Also at its October 1, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee responded to my point that the same language appears
in both Rule 12.1 (alibi defense) and Rule 12.3 (public authority defense) regarding disclosure of addresses of crime victims.
>85 It therefore proposed to add the same changes to Rule 12.3 that it added to Rule 12.1. *8° Unfortunately, for the reasons
discussed at length here, now the language in both Rule 12.1 and 12.3 is insufficiently protective of victims' rights. *87

Rule 17. At its April 16, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee revised its rule on subpoenas for confidential information to
read: Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require that notice be given to
the victim so that the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object. *°8 This change responds to
objections from the American Bar Association, other groups, and me that the earlier rule encouraged ex parte [*968] issuance
