In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 392 F.Supp.2d 539 (2005)

10 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 789

that it has been designated a terrorist, but claims it does
not have the same connections to the United States, bin
Laden, and al Qaeda that Defendants Benevolence
International Foundation (“BIF”) and Adel A.J. Batterjee
had. See Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 823-25
(finding Court had personal jurisdiction over Mr.
Batterjee based on his designation as a global terrorist, his
role with BIF, another designated terrorist, his *561
leadership of BIF’s United States operations, and his
relationship with Osama bin Laden). It also argues that
the document that Plaintiffs attribute to Osama bin Laden
is similar to the Golden Chain, in that it lacks foundation
and authentification. See Terrorist Attacks I, 349
F.Supp.2d at 817 (“The ‘Golden Chain’ is a group of
documents that was discovered by Bosnian authorities
searching the offices of charity Defendant BIF in March
2002. Plaintiffs claim the ‘Golden Chain’ contains a list
of early direct donors to al Qaeda.”)

P11 Tn assessing whether Rabita Trust has purposefully
directed its activities at the United States under Rule 4(k),
the Court is mindful of the executive branch’s designation
of it as a SDGT. While the designation is not dispositive
on its own, it does warrant some deference. In the realm
of foreign affairs, the executive branch has access to
“confidential sources of information [and] agents in the
form of diplomatic, consular and other officials.” United
States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 320, 57
S.Ct. 216, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936). Entities are designated
under Executive Order 13224 if the executive branch
determines they are involved in terrorist activities. See
Executive Order 13224 Fact Sheet. Courts enjoy great
discretion in deciding whether to order jurisdictional
discovery before resolving motions to dismiss for lack of
personal jurisdiction. See, e.g, APWU v. Potter, 343 F.3d
619, 627 (2d Cir.2003). This Court finds that such
discovery would be helpful in assessing whether any of
Rabita Trust’s activities were directed at the United
States. Accordingly, Rabita Trust’s motions to dismiss the
Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints are denied
without prejudice.

C. Wa‘el Jalaidan®
21 The United States Department of Treasury has
designated Defendant Jalaidan a terrorist,’ frozen his
assets, and named him “one of the founders of al Qaeda.”
(Ashton Compl. J 304; Burnett Compl. § 255; Federal
Compl. Ff 117, 91.) The Treasury Department
“characterized [him] as having ‘directed organizations
that have provided financial and logistical support to
al-Qa-ida, [he] is the logistics chief of bin Laden’s
organization and fought on bin Laden’s side in

WESTLAW

Afghanistan.’ ” (Ashton Compl. J¥ 304, 312, 523-24;
Burnett Compl. J 236, 255, 271; Federal Compl. § 117;
see also Federal Compl. § 196 (claiming documents
found in the Bosnian raid of BIF offices contained a note
from Osama bin Laden to Jalaidan regarding al Qaeda’s
need for weapons).) Further, Osama bin Laden and his
lieutenant, Abu Zubaydah, allegedly “have acknowledged
Wa‘el Julaidan as a known associate of their operations.
Julaidan has been the head of various non-government
organizations providing financial and logistical support to
the al-Qa‘ida network.” (Ashton Compl. Jf 304, 312, 341,
484; Burnett Compl. § 236, 255.)

Jalaidan was in charge of the MWL in Peshawar, Pakistan
and served as the General Director of Rabita Trust.
(Ashton Compl. J 304; Burnett Compl. J 236, 255.) He
“operated MWL offices that served in the early days of al
Qaeda to attract and train holy warriors from around the
world for the war in Afghanistan” and has “repeatedly
aided and abetted terrorists.” (Ashton Compl. § 304,
*362 312; Burnett Compl. § 255.) Jalaidan is also
allegedly connected to Defendant SIRC. (Ashton Compl.
4 484; Federal Compl. § 125.)

Defendant Jalaidan argues that the allegations against him
are simply allegations of guilt by association, and do not
include any specificity regarding dates to put his actions
in context. He urges the Court to not rely on his
designation as a terrorist by the Treasury Department
because he did not have an opportunity to rebut it.

Plaintiffs do not claim to have served Mr. Jalaidan in the
United States under the ATA’s nationwide service
provision. Accordingly, Rule 4(k)(2) may provide a basis
for personal jurisdiction. There are several federal claims
at issue in this litigation and Plaintiffs have not made a
prima facie showing that Mr. Jalaidan is subject to
personal jurisdiction in New York or any other state. The
Court turns to Mr. Jalaidan’s contacts with the United
States. In addition to being designated as a global terrorist
by the Department of Treasury, Mr. Jalaidan is alleged to
be a founder and the logistical chief of al Qaeda, and
affiliated with several other charities that are allegedly in
al Qaeda’s fundraising network. In light of al Qaeda’s
public declarations of war against the United States,
someone who is alleged to be a founder, an admitted
associate, and a provider of financial and logistical
support to al Qaeda, has purposefully directed his
activities at the United States such that the exercise of
personal jurisdiction over him is reasonable.’ See Mwani
v. bin Laden, 417 F.3d 1, 14 (C.A.D.C. 2005).
