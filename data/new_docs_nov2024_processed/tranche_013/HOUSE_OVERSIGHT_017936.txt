Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 2 of 28

Plaintiff, VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, formerly known as Virginia Roberts (“Roberts”), for
her Complaint against Defendant, Alan Dershowitz (“Dershowitz”) avers upon personal
knowledge as to her own acts and status and upon information and belief and to all other matters:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This suit arises out of Defendant’s defamatory statements of and concerning
Plaintiff.

2. During 2000-2002, beginning when Plaintiff was 16, Plaintiff was the victim of
sex trafficking and abuse by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

3. Epstein’s trafficking scheme involved recruiting young girls, often by claiming
they would be paid $200 for simply providing a massage to a wealthy billionaire. The young girl
would then be brought up to Epstein’s bedroom where Epstein would be on a massage table;
Epstein would then sexually abuse the girl. This same pattern was repeated numerous times with
numerous children.

4. “From between 1999 — 2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor
girls...in his mansion in Palm Beach Florida, and elsewhere in the United States and overseas...
In addition to his own sexual abuse of the victims, Epstein directed other persons to abuse the
girls sexually. Epstein used paid employees to find and bring minor girls to him. Epstein
worked in concert with others to obtain minors not only for his sexual gratification, but also for
the sexual gratification of others.” United States District Court Judge Marra February 21, 2016
Summary Judgement Order at 2, Case No.: 9:08-cv-80786 (internal citations omitted). One of
the persons with whom Epstein acted in concert was Dershowitz.

5. Like other minor children who came before and after her, Plaintiff was initially

recruited to provide massages, and thereafter to engage in a variety of sexual acts, for Epstein.
