VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,

Plaintiff, Case No.:
v.
ALAN DERSHOWITZ,
Defendant.
/
AFFIDAVIT

I, Maria Farmer, swear and affirm as follows:
1. I am currently over the age of 18 and presently reside in Kentucky.

2. In approximately 1995, I was an artist and a graduate student and I met Jeffrey
Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at an art show where I was displaying some of my
art. Epstein said that if I sold him one of my paintings for half price he would help
me with my career. I sold him the painting that night for half price which was
approximately $6000.00. In 1996, Jeffrey Epstein called me and told me he was
looking for someone to help him with acquiring art. I took the job with Epstein but
ultimately my job responsibilities were not simply to purchase art but included
manning the front door at his New York mansion and keeping records of people
who came to the home.

3, During the time I was supervising the door at Epstein’s mansion, I witnessed a
number of school age girls coming to the home, some of the young girls would be
wearing their school uniforms. The girls would come into the NY mansion and
then would be escorted upstairs. When I asked Maxwell why these young girls
were coming over to the house so often she said that the girls were interviewing for
modeling positions. At the time, based on my observations at the home, it did not
seem credible to me that these young girls were interviewing for modeling
positions.

4, Alan Dershowitz was an individual who came to visit Epstein at his New York
mansion a number of times when I was working for Epstein. Dershowitz was very
comfortable at the home and would come in and walk upstairs. On a number
occasions I witnessed Dershowitz at the NY mansion going upstairs at the same
time there were young girls under the age of 18 who were present upstairs in the
house.
