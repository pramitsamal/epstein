calling names, controlling what the other person does, etc, then it's often useful for it to
be communicated -- and also time-bounded. For example: You can only call me pathetic
during this sexual encounter. Otherwise, please don't.”

There are BDSM couples that get rid of time boundaries, and have ongoing BDSM
relationship situations; there are also BDSM couples that don't use safewords. I think
those relationships require a lot of understanding and care from all parties involved. I've
never gone without safewords, but sometimes I go without time-bounding, and when I
do, I make very sure that I can trust my partner and communicate well with him. (Thomas
MacAulay Millar calls safeword-free BDSM the advanced class.)
