A part-time Palm Beacher who has
socialized with Donald Trump, Bill
Clinton and Kevin Spacey was jailed
early Sunday with accused drug dealers,
drunken drivers and wife beaters after
he was charged with soliciting a prosti-
tute.

Manhattan money manager Jeffrey
Epstein, 53, was picked up at his home
on El Brillo Way at 1:45 am. He was
released hours later on $3,000 bond.

Epstein was indicted last week by a
state grand jury, according to state at-
torney’s spokesman Mike Edmondson.
Despite Epstein’s arrest, the indictment
containing the allegations remained
sealed Sunday and Edmondson provid-
ed no details.

Unlike most accused johns, Epstein
was charged with a third-degree felony
instead of a misdemeanor. Under state
law, a solicitation charge usually is ele-
vated to amore-serious felony when the
defendant has at least two solicitation

lished reports. National
magazines have described
him as a “mysterious billion-
aire” who lives in a 45,000-
square-foot New York City
mansion.

He has been in trouble
before. In 1993, he and two
other defendants were
charged in federal-court with
three counts of postal larceny
and theft and one count of
property theft. Epstein plead
guilty to a single charge of
conspiring to steal U.S.
Treasury checks from resi-
dential. mailboxes and_re-
ceived 5 years’ probation.
The remaining charges were

dropped.

Since then, Epstein’s
name has turned up in New
York City’s tabloids. The New
York Post noted he flew Pres-
ident Clinton and Kevin
Spacey to Africa on his pri-
vate Boeing 727. In 2003, the
paper dubbed him one of the
Big Apple’s “top studs.”

In 2004, Epstein bid
against Trump for a 43,000-
square foot Palm Beach es-
tate once owned by health-
care magnate Abe Gosman.
Trump topped Epstein with a
$41.35 million bid.

However, checks of court records
here and in New York Sunday turned up

by West Palm Beach attorney Jack
Goldberg, who declined comment.
