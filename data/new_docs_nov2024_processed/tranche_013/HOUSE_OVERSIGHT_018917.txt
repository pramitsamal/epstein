Indictment: Billionaire solicited 3 times }

Palm Beach police will report
today about their prostitution
probe of the money manager.

By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Billionaire money manager and
Palm Beach part-time resident Jeffrey
Epstein solicited or procured prostitutes
three or more times between Aug. 1 and
Oct. 31 of last year, according to an in-
dictment charging him with felony so-
licitation of prostitution.

Epstein, 53, was booked at the Palm
Beach County jail at 1:45 am. Sunday.
He was released on $3,000 bond.

Epstein’s case is unusual in that
suspected prostitution johns are usually
charged with a misdemeanor, and.even
a felony charge is typically made in a
criminal information — an alternative to
an indictment charging a person with

aE 2

the commission of a
crime. é
His attorney, Jack |*
Goldberger, declined to |
discuss the charge. a

State attorney's of |}
fice spokesman Mike
Edmondson also had
little to say.

“Generally speak-
ing, there is a case that
has a number of different aspects to it,”
Edmondson said of a_prostitution-
related charge being submitted to a
grand jury. “We first became aware of
the case months ago by Palm Beach
police.”

Prosecutors.and police worked to-
gether to bring the case to the grand
jury, he said.

Palm Beach police confirmed that
and said the department will release a
report today regarding its investigation.

Epstein has owned a five-bedroom,
7%-bath, 7,234-square-foot home with a
pool and a boat dock on the Intracoastal

Epstein

Waterway since 1990, according to
property records. A man answering the
door there Monday said that Epstein
wasn’t home. A Cadillac Escalade reg-
istered to him was parked in the drive-
way, which is flanked by two massive
gargoyles.

Epstein sued Property Appraiser
Gary Nikolits in 2001, contending that
the assessment of his home exceeded
its fair market value. He dismissed his
lawsuit in December 2002.

A profile of Epstein in Vanity Fair
magazine said he owns what are be-
lieved to be the largest private homes in
Manhattan — 51,000 square feet — and
in New Mexico — a 7,500-acre ranch.

Those are in addition to his 70-acre is- |
land in the U.S. Virgin Islands and fleet:

of aircraft.

Epstein’s friends and admirers, ac-
cording to the magazine, include prom-
inent businessmen, academics and sci-
entists and famed Harvard law professor
Alan Dershowitz.
