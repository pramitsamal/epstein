She considered Epstein a pervert, and he kept pushing to go
further and further until [Cynthia] explained she would keep
telling him she had a boyfriend.

Only recently, Cynthia says, did she begin to remove her
clothes in the course of giving Epstein massages.

“Jett would try to get away with more and more on each mas-
sage,” she tells the cops.

Still, Sarah had Cynthia’s cell phone number, and Sarah
would call whenever Epstein was in Palm Beach to make an
appointment for “work.”

Each time she went, Sarah would meet her at the kitchen
door area. She would bring her upstairs and prepare the
massage table. [Cynthia] advised Epstein would ask her
questions about herself. Epstein knew she was a soccer
player and would be attending [a nearby] university.

The cops want to know: Did Epstein know her real age?

[Cynthia] stated Epstein did and didn’t care. The most recent
massage she provided was on October 1, 2005.

October 1,

That's less than a week ago.

What the cops know now is that Epstein’s still at it.
What they’re about to learn seals Epstein’s fate.
