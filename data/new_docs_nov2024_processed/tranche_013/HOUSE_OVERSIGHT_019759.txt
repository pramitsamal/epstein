through three airports. Because large sums of cash must be declared,
the detection of the money could compromise his plan to deliver his

journalists in Hong Kong. After what I had learned from Cherkashin

communications intelligence secrets, | viewed Snowden’s access to
this material to be a crucially important part of the mystery.
