It was the president who, meeting with Scaramucci, was won over by the Mooch’s
cringeworthy Wall Street hortatory flattery. (“I can only hope to realize a small part of
your genius as a communicator, but you are my example and model” was one report of the
gist of the Scaramucci supplication.) And it was Trump who then urged that Scaramucci
become the true communications chief, reporting directly to the president.

On July 19, Jared and Ivanka, through intermediaries, put a feeler out to Bannon: What
would he think about Scaramucci’s coming on board in the comms job?

So preposterous did this seem to Bannon—it was a cry of haplessness, and certain
evidence that the couple had become truly desperate—that he refused to consider or even
reply to the question. Now he was sure: Jarvanka was losing it.
