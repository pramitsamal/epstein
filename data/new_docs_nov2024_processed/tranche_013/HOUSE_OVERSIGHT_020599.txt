also played a key diplomatic role in certain instances, such as providing a liaison

dialogue channel between the United States and North Korea.

In addition, the ILD performs a range of other functions:

e Administering “private sector” liaison organizations to facilitate contact with

think tanks, NGOs, and individuals worldwide;

e Collecting current intelligence and information on the foreign policies,
domestic political scene and political parties, and societies in various nations

worldwide;

e Sending special study teams abroad to research important topics related to

China’s reforms;

e Contributing to the work of Chinese embassies worldwide (usually monitoring
domestic politics and liaising with domestic political parties, movements, and

personages);

e Working with other CCP Central Committee departments and State Council
ministries to facilitate their work overseas (e.g., assisting the United Front Work
Department concerning Taiwan, the External Propaganda Leading Group/State
Council Information Office concerning China’s image abroad, or the National

People’s Congress on parliamentary exchanges);

e Arranging visits of central-level, provincial-level, municipal-level, and

occasionally sub-provincial level CCP officials abroad;

e Hosting foreign leaders, politicians, party officials, ex-officials, as well as a range

of foreign policy specialists, on tours of China;

e Hosting biannual World Political Parties High-Level Meeting, and the annual
“CCP in Dialogue with the World” meeting.

As such, the ILD performs extremely important roles overseas and is a key—but
underappreciated and even unknown—instrument in China’s international influence

activities.
