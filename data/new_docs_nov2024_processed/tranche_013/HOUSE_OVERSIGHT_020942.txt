America Recovery & Reinvestment Act (ARRA):

Recipient of 34% of Net Government (Taxpayer) Funding

In ARRA (the economic stimulus program created in February,
2009), USA Inc. aims to create jobs and promote investment and
consumer spending by cutting taxes, expanding unemployment
benefits, and increasing spending in education, healthcare,
infrastructure, and energy.

These measures are projected to increase federal spending by $500+
billion while reducing federal tax receipts by $275 billion over 10 years
($177 billion of which occurred in F2009 and F2010).
