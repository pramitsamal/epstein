Observations from Previous Slide

While GDP and USA Inc. tax revenue have grown at a 3% annual rate
for 40 years, entitlement spending has grown 5%, net interest
payments have risen 3%, and defense plus non-defense discretionary
spending (including education, infrastructure, law enforcement and
judiciary) have risen by 1%. These different growth rates have become
even more pronounced in recent years.

Questions:

1) Isn’t it time for a re-set and acknowledgment of trade-offs? Should taxes,
non-defense discretionary spending, and defense spending grow in line with
GDP over time? Should entitlement spending be restructured to be more
efficient and supportable by the ongoing financial dynamics of USA, Inc. and
also grow in line with or below GDP?
