Observations from Previous Slide

Entitlement spending has risen to 51% of total spending, higher than 40-
year average of 42% (and much higher than the 21% in 1965), defense
spending has fallen to 20% from 24% average, non-defense discretionary
spending (including education, infrastructure, energy, law enforcement
and veteran services) has fallen to 22% from 23%, and net interest
payments have fallen to 7% from 11%, despite higher debt (largely because
of declining interest rates). These trends have become more pronounced
in recent years.

Questions:

1) Should entitlement spending account for 51% (and rising) share of total USA
Inc.’s spending, while other key areas (such as education, infrastructure, energy,
law enforcement...) account for only 22% (and falling) of spending?
