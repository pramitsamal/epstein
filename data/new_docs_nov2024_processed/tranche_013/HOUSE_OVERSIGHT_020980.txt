Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Combination of Reducing Benefits

(Including Covered Lives) & / or Raising Taxes

Consider:
1) Reduce Medicare benefits by 53%? and/or
2) Increase Medicare tax rate from 2.9% to 6.8%? and/or

3) Some combination of all / some the above

However you look at it, this math is draconian. A 53% cut in
Medicare benefits and / or more than doubling taxes are unrealistic.
The situation for Medicaid is even worse, as Medicaid has no
dedicated funding source.

Neither Medicare nor Medicaid has yet fully faced up to the crisis and
reform that Social Security experienced in the early 1980s.
