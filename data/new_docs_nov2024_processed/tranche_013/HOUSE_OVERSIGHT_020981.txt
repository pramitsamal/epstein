Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Incentives Support Healthcare Cost Growth

¢ Consumers demand healthcare services with less regard
for the full economic impact as they pay only a fraction of
the true cost out of pocket.

¢ Healthcare service providers are generally rewarded for
pushing more services through the system, largely with
relatively less regard for cost effectiveness.

Bottom line = Powerful forces encourage spending

related to social / economic / legal issues throughout
the healthcare system.
