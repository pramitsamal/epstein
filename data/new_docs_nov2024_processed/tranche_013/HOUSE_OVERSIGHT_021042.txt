Illustrating the Revenue Tradeoffs —

Changing Tax Rates vs. Broadening the Tax Base

Mathematical Illustrations*

1) To eliminate F2010 deficits by increasing individual / corporate / payroll tax
rates across-the-board would require +12 percentage points of tax rate increase
(raising $1.4 trillion) — and would likely damage economic growth? or

2) To eliminate primary budget deficit** by F2019E by increasing top two tiers of
income tax rates would require moving marginal rates to 72% / 77% from 33% /
35% — also likely to damage growth and encourage tax avoidance? or

3) Broadening tax base could require reducing ‘tax expenditures’ and subsidies,
e.g., limiting deductions and subsidies for housing & healthcare?

Policy Options
1) Acombination of somewhat higher rates and a broader tax base? and/or

2) Changing taxation of individual income to encourage saving / investment
rather than consumption (perhaps a value-added tax and/or carbon tax)? and/or

3) Changing taxation of corporate income to reflect global competition?

Note: *The simple tax math presented here are pure mathematical illustrations — we simply calculated how big a broad-based tax rate increase (for
individual and corporate income, as well as payroll) would have to be for USA Inc. to financial break-even. These calculations are merely mechanical
iflustrations and are not meant to portray realistic solutions. **Primary budget deficit is the budget deficit excluding net interest payments.

Changing USA Inc.’s Tax System Could Help

Rebalance the Economy & Reallocate Resources

e Though there would be adjustment costs, reducing subsidies and ‘tax
expenditures’ could broaden the tax base and collect more revenue, while
allowing income tax rates to stay low or go lower.

e The current system favors consumption, penalizes saving; a tax based on
consumption (or “value added”) could offset some of that penalty, though there
are risks and drawbacks.

e Subsidies create incentives to consume more health insurance and housing —
both account for 20% of GDP, vs. 11% in 19651 — and take resources from other
sectors like education, technology, infrastructure.

e A worldwide corporate tax system with a lower tax rate could reduce incentives
for companies to keep income offshore.

e Acarbon tax could raise some additional revenue to reduce the deficit, while
encouraging sustainable economic development.
