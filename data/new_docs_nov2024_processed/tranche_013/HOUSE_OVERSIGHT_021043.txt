Note: *Each foregone revenue estimate assumes ail other parts of the Tax Code remain unchanged during F2009. Aggregate tax subsidies presented here is simply
the sum of individual estimates. In reality, the aggregate estimate would be different if tax subsidies were changed simultaneously because of potential interactions

among provisions.

Raising Revenue by Reducing Tax Expenditures & Subsidies: Examples

* Reducing the biggest tax expenditures and subsidies could net $1.7
trillion in additional revenue over the next decade, per CBO and the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget:

— Reduce the tax exclusion for health insurance or replace with a credit
— Cap the deduction for state and local taxes

Gradually reduce the mortgage interest deduction or change to a credit
Limit the tax benefit of other deductions, e.g., charitable contributions

¢« Some subsidies encourage saving or investment...and cutting them
could mean short-term revenue gain but a net loss over time.
Examples:

— Favorable taxation of capital gains, dividends, and pension contributions
— Exclude investment income from life insurance and annuities in taxable income
— Accelerated depreciation or expensing of capital equipment outlays
