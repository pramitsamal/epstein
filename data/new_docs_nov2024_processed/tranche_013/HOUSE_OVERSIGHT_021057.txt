General Motors —

Entitlement Spending Became Too Onerous for this Great American Company

1908 — Founded in Flint, Michigan to manufacture automobiles

1988 — Free cash flow peaked at $6.3B

1999 — Reached a peak market capitalization of $61B

Why did GM file for bankruptcy?

Products became increasingly uncompetitive. In addition, pension plans to
support 650,000 retirees and their dependents (compared with 80,000 active
employees in N. America as of 2010) rose to 4.8% of GM’s annual expenses and
$4,679 in annual pension payments per worker to former workers.
