Author’s Note

Shortly after Donald Trump’s inauguration as the forty-fifth president of
the United States, I was allowed into the West Wing as a sideline observer.
My book Fire and Fury was the resulting account of the organizational
chaos and constant drama—more psychodrama than political drama—of
Trump’s first seven months in office. Here was a volatile and uncertain
president, releasing, almost on a daily basis, his strange furies on the world,
and, at the same time, on his own staff. This first phase of the most abnor-
mal White House in American history ended in August 2017, with the
departure of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and the appointment of
retired general John Kelly as chief of staff.

This new account begins in February 2018 at the outset of Trumps
second year in office, with the situation now profoundly altered. The pres-
ident’s capricious furies have been met by an increasingly organized and
methodical institutional response. The wheels of justice are inexorably
turning against him. In many ways, his own government, even his own
White House, has begun to turn on him. Virtually every power center left
of the far-right wing has deemed him unfit. Even some among his own
base find him undependable, hopelessly distracted, and in over his head.
Never before has a president been under such concerted attack with such
a limited capacity to defend himself.

His enemies surround him, dedicated to bringing him down.
