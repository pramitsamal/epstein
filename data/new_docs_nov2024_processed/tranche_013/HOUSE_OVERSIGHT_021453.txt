and Donald Trump among

“Highly unusual’ is how
Palm Beach Police Chief Mi-
chael Reiter described State
Attorney Barry Krischer’s
handling of the case in a
bluntly critical letter to
Krischer last year before
Epstein was indicted.

Reiter referred the mat-
‘ter to the FBI to determine
whether any federal laws had
been violated. Epstein’s allies
countered by attacking the
chief personally and profes-
sionally.

Reiter department in-
vestigated Epstein for 11
months. Police sifted repeat-
edly through his trash and
conducted surveillance on
his five-bedroom, 7-bath,
7,234-square-foot home on
the Intracoastal Waterway.

Police said Epstein paid
women and girls as young
as 14 to give him erotic mas-
sages at his home. Police
thought there was probable
cause to charge him with
unlawful sex acts with a mi-
nor and lewd and lascivious
molestation. ‘

Gg Epstein responded by
whiring a phalanx of lawyers.

rather than file’ charges di-
rectly against Epstein.
Epstein’s attorneys deny
he had sex with underage
girls. The lawyers say the
girls’ stories are not credible.
But if the court file is any
indicator, they've made no ef

fort to depose the girls.
Neither prosecutors nor
defense attorneys have

sought to question Robson,
said Dutko, her attorney. She
recruited teenage girls to vis-
it Epstein for massages and
sexual activity, Palm Beach
police said, and presumably
would be a key witness.

Epstein’s attorney Jack
Goldberger did not return
phone messages.

A source close to the case
suggested it is languishing
pending a decision by the
FBI on whether to refer it to
federal prosecutors.

“We still have a pending
case,” FBI spokeswoman

. Judy Orihuela said Monday.

State Attorney Krischer
did not return a call for com-
ment. His spokesman, Mike
Edmondson, declined to say
whether federal investiga-
tors are delaying the Epstein
case. But, he added, “if an-
other agency is looking at
something, we wouldn’t want
to step on their toes.”

a pending case:

Attorneys say inertia in a
criminal case often points to

a pending plea deal.

“It would not surprise me
if something has happened
thats not reflected in the
court file,” said Dutko, such
as an agreement that will be
formalized later.

Defense. attorney Marc
Shiner said defense  at-
torneys sometimes put off
overtly conducting discov-
ery — deposing witnesses,
requesting documents and
the like — because doing so.

creates more work for har

ried prosecutors who may
become angry and not offer
apleadeal.

“Sometimes defense law-
yers, knowing that, will try
and do discovery without
taking depositions,” said
Shiner, a former prosecutor
for 13 years.

Instead, they may conduct
a below-the-radar probe such
as having a private investiga-
tor check out leads, he said.

Shiner and others say a
plea deal for Epstein probably
would result in pretrial inter-
vention, in which a defendant
may be ordered to undergo
a psychological evaluation,
counseling or other condi-
tions in return for dropping
the charge.

Edmondson, spokesman
for State Attorney Krischer,
said there is no plea offer
and no request for the pros-
ecution to show its cards.

“To my knowledge, it’s
never happened before on a
filed case,” he said.
