offenders are required to register

ond “Operation Island Sweep” in the
territory, Frazer said.

Currently, 55 sex offenders are
registered between St. Thomas and
St. John, and 42 sex offenders’ are
registered on St. Croix. *

Sex offenders are obligated to reg-
ister in whatever community they
reside in under federal law and terri-
torial law, so as to make communi-
ties aware of where offenders live.

The department encouraged com-
munity members to visit usvinsopw.

gov to access the registry and view
the list of sex offenders in the Virgin
Islands.

The department also asked that
anyone knowing the whereabouts of
an unregistered sex offender to con-
tact it at 774-5666 on St. Thomas
or 773-0295 on St. Croix and pro-
vide information to one of the Sex
Offender Registry coordinators.
