University of Utah's general counsel's office, the
university -- I'm sorry -- the Utah Attorney General's
office, Attorney General Reaz * (ph) and other persons
there. And the Searcy -- well, Mr. Scarola's law firm,
I'm trying to remember -- sorry, Jack, I can't remember
the name of all your partners off the top of my head.

MR. SCAROLA: That's quite all right.

MR. SIMPSON: He's the man.

THE WITNESS: It's the law firm that

Mr. Scarola is a named partner in.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. And is it -- am I correct that you cannot say
one way or the other whether that written agreement was
executed before or after December 30th, 2014?

A. That's right. Sitting here right now, no, I
can't recall.

Q. Okay. I want to go back to the motion for

joinder which is Exhibit 2, and the provision -- not the

provision -- the assertion that we were referring to.
A. Right, right.
Q. Concerning not Virginia Roberts, but other

minors. Do you have that in mind?
