All these possibilities seemed bizarre. And yet everything
connected with Epstein’s story seemed to be bizarre.

Bill Clinton got the use of a jet out of Epstein—a trip to
Africa. But he and Epstein weren't bosom buddies.

As for Prince Andrew, we already know how he feels about

women.

But what did Dershowitz get out of Epstein, aside from
Epstein’s wise counsel on all the books he'd written?

One advantage Dershowitz had, as he laid out his argument,
was that when it came to Jeffrey Epstein, all bets were off. He
didn't have to establish his innocence. All he had to do was make
sure that the waters stayed muddy. The more complicated things
seemed to be, the better they were for Dershowitz.

Thanks to Jeffrey Epstein’s actions, and the endlessly compli-

cated cycle of suits and countersuits those actions inspired,

those waters were very muddy indeed.
