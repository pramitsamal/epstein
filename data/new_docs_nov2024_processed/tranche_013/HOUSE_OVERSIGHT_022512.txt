The FCPA:

Anti-Bribery Provisions

THE FCPA: ANTI-BRIBERY

PROVISIONS

The FCPA addresses the problem of international corruption in two ways: (1)

the anti-bribery provisions, which are discussed below, prohibit individuals

and businesses from bribing foreign government officials in order to obtain

or retain business and (2) the accounting provisions, which are discussed in

Chapter 3, impose certain record keeping and internal control requirements

on issuers, and prohibit individuals and companies from knowingly falsifying

an issuer's books and records or circumventing or failing to implement an is-

suer’s system of internal controls. Violations of the FCPA can lead to civil and

criminal penalties, sanctions, and remedies, including fines, disgorgement,

and/or imprisonment.

In general, the FCPA prohibits offering to pay, pay-
ing, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money
or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influ-
ence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her
official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage

in order to obtain or retain business.

Who Is Covered by the Anti-Bribery Provisions?
The FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions apply broadly to

three categories of persons and entities: (1) “issuers” and

their officers, directors, employees, agents, and sharehold-
ers; (2) “domestic concerns” and their officers, directors,
employees, agents, and shareholders; and (3) certain per-
sons and entities, other than issuers and domestic concerns,

acting while in the territory of the United States.
