I wouldn’t mind attending a meeting or portion of a meeting with JE. If he is the mastermind, and you
want to move quickly, it might get a lot of questions resolved quickly.

On different subject: general time frame is: docs (notes and purchase and sale agreement to you tomorrow
end of biz); incorporate your comments monday and get docs to trust attorney tuesday;
contemporaneously meet in person with you tuesday or wednesday and do a dry run. On these days ada
will also take the trustees through outline of docs they will receive thursday. Docs to trustees, leon et al on
thursday and signatures gathered by friday for first close 12/22. Tight but doable. Ada, alan agree?

PS: ada, you shld begin to think abt where people are (jh, rr, bc, Idb) next week.

To: Melanie Spinella

elegant solution ;re fee. , 30 million paid now. with purchase of noel kalb, paid with funds from the
drawdown. you should use and keep open the line for the full 30m and leave it outstanding until its
expiration. in four months. legit biz reason, very nice , - the balance of the fee - paid in kind either low
basis art . or interest in either milenium ,lone cascade ,or king street.
