Rates vol is near all-time lows and is favorable for positioning for a break-out
Since the US Election last November, the 10y US Treasury rate has fluctuated between
2.17% and 2.63%, constantly being jostled up or down by various economic forces. It is
currently trading towards the bottom of that range. Our rates strategists have a year-
end target of 2.85% for the 10y rate (just above the median forecast).

Long-term rates have remained low due to uncertainty around Fiscal policy (Trump’s
plans on infrastructure spending), subdued inflation expectations and a slower than
expected Fed hiking cycle. On the other hand, a near full-employment economy, hopes
for infrastructure spending, potential for higher inflation driven by energy prices &
increased government spending and an accelerated hiking cycle are providing a floor for
long-term rates. In the end, uncertainty remains and analysts’ estimates for the year-
end target vary widely between 1.6% and 3.7% (based on 59 forecasts with median and
mean of 2.8%).

For investors who believe that long-term rates will break out of their range we
recommend going long TLT 6m 35-delta strangles. The structure has rarely been
cheaper in history (Chart 22) and at present TLT 6m implied vol is 94bps below 6m
realized, with the spread at its lowest since Aug-15. A 3m version of the 35-delta
strangle prices just as attractively versus its history.
