SX5E Dec18 div futures are high relative to Dec17 and BofAML div forecasts

SX5E Dec18 dividend futures are trading at €122.4 (6.8% higher than Dec17 dividend
futures), which is unusually high relative to history. Indeed, Chart 34 highlights that the
second DED future (currently Dec18) is at its highest level in 8 years relative to the first
(currently Dec17). Moreover, Dec18 div futures are trading only 1.5% below BofAML
fundamental bottom-up forecasts of 124.2 for 2018, suggesting low upside potential if
BofAML forecasts materialise (Chart 35).
