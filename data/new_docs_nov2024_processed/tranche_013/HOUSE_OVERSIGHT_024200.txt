The most important energy developments of 2012: how countries are planning for Independence Day

Bottom line: China has a long history of economic, political and military co-operation with Iran. China has greater economic
linkages with the US, but for China, that fact does not negate the advantages of its relationship with Iran, particularly as its
energy needs continue to rise, and as it seeks to prevent U.S. domination of the Persian Gulf.

V: Another rough year for the electric car

Forecasts of greater electric car penetration have been around since the 1970’s. A report by The National Regulatory Research
Institute in 1980 aggregated various studies, which predicted 1.2 mm units in use in the US by 1983, 3 mm by 1990, 5 mm by
1995, 6.2 mm by 1998 and 13 mm by 2000. Instead, only 2.5 mm have been sold since 1999, and this mostly includes hybrids,
which are not true plug-in electric vehicles (most use regenerative braking for short distance trips). Since 2010, only 50,000
highway-capable plug-in electric vehicles have been sold in the US, less than 0.03% of all vehicles. For decades, scientists have
projected battery breakthroughs using nickel-zinc, iron-air, nickel-air, as well as combinations of zinc with chlorine or air and
sulfur with sodium or lithium. Progress has been slow. Affordable mass-produced electric cars are still on the drawing board.

« Toyota cancelled plans for sales of eQ vehicles, claiming that the current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet
society’s needs. Toyota planned to sell 40,000 plug-in hybrids in Japan this year; only 8,400 have been sold so far

« After receiving a $529mm loan from the US government, Fisker developed and built the Karma in Finland. Its battery failed
during the Consumer Reports test drive, and Fisker subsequently recalled all of its 2012 Karma batteries

 A123 Systems, Inc., maker of the recalled lithium-ion battery used in the Karma and recipient of a $249mm Federal grant in
2009, filed for bankruptcy protection on October 16, 2012

« Tesla cut their delivery targets for 2012 from 5,000 to 2,700-3,250 due to production issues

= The Chevy Volt is the most successful electric car in the US, but only 16,400 have been sold this year through September,
vs the goal of 45,000 that was set by the Department of Energy. Sales of the Nissan Leaf in the US are down 28% vs 2011.

If you have gotten this far, I hope you enjoyed our annual energy issue. Sce you next year, when it will be the 40
anniversary of Soylent Green, in which Edward G Robinson rides a bicycle to power a lamp so he can read a book.

Biography
Vaclav Smil is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the Faculty of Environment at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg and a Fellow of

the Royal Society of Canada. His interdisciplinary research includes the studies of energy systems (resources, conversions, and impacts),
environmental change (particularly global biogeochemical cycles), and the history of technical advances and interactions among energy,
environment, food, economy, and population. He is the author of more than thirty books and more than three hundred papers on these
subjects and has lectured widely in North America, Europe, and Asia. In 2010 he was noted by Foreign Policy magazine as #49 on its list of
the 100 most influential thinkers in the world.
