We believe a floor price exists for natural gas despite shale production. We fully acknowledge that the
US has large reserves of shale gas awaiting development. However, the current spot price (S3.42/mmbtu)
sits below the breakeven full-cycle cost of most US basins ($3.50-$4.00/mmbtu), which has led producers
to focus on liquids-rich plays and de-emphasize dry-gas production. Accordingly, the gas rig count is at a
decade low and the Energy Information Administration expects gas production to be flat through 2014.
With the wide spread between oil and U.S. natural gas prices likely to continue, we expect the growth in
liquids shale production to remain much higher than gas.

On the demand side, the power sector is the largest consumer (37%) of natural gas in the US. At prices
below $5/mmbtu, coal switching begins, and at prices below $3/mmbtu, gas-fired power generating units
become competitive against even the most efficient coal units. Importantly, the breakeven point for coal-
to-gas switching will rise materially due to EPA mandates. By 2015, these standards move the breakeven
point for the most efficient coal units from $3/mmbtu to approximately $4/mmbtu, close to where
current forward prices sit.

Large potential structural changes in demand create upside optionality. There has been much media
focus on the growth of shale gas production, so much so that we believe potential demand drivers are
underappreciated. For example, currently-planned US coal plant retirements, if repowered with gas,
would support an additional 6 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of gas demand, adding nearly 10% to total
US demand. In addition, we see the potential for LNG exports to exceed another 6 bcf/d (27 bcf/d of
project capacity awaits US Department of Energy approval). Cheap gas is also spurring an industrial
resurgence, with new petrochemical plants being proposed in the Gulf and traditional coal users such as
steel mills contemplating refiring their facilities with gas instead of metallurgical coal. Longer term, LNG
as a vehicle fuel substitute for long haul trucks and CNG for lighter vehicles could also add materially to
gas demand. Given the number of possible structural demand changes and the enormous potential from
each, we believe the optionality for natural gas prices is clearly to the upside.

We believe the recent trend of softer US natural gas prices leading to a deflationary impact on global
utility sector earnings is, then, largely played out. Longer-term, we see many positive demand
