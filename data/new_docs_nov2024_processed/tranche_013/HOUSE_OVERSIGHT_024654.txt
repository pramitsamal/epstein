= The Human Endocannabinoid System

The human endocannabinoid system consists of nervous and immune system receptors involved in
regulating health and physiological functions. There are two types of endocannabinoid receptors, CB1
and CB2 receptors, which are located in the brain and in other organs, tissues and glands throughout
the human body. The human body actively regulates variables related to appetite, immune response,
memory, mood, pain, sleep and other functions by naturally creating compounds known as “endo-
cannabinoids” and delivering them to these receptors. The following illustration depicts the human

endocannabinoid system and the location of CB1 and CB2 receptors.

The physiological effects of cannabis consumption are believed to be primarily the result of THC,
CBD and other cannabinoids bonding with the body’s endocannabinoid receptors and the consequent
impact on functions regulated by the endocannabinoid system. As scientists gain a deeper understand-
ing of the human endocannabinoid system, they are beginning to explore the application of cannabi-
noids to a broad range of medical conditions and ailments. Although medical research on cannabinoids
is nascent, cannabis is currently being used to manage many conditions, including anxiety, depression,
inflammation, insomnia, nausea, neural disorders and pain.

CB1 and CB2 Receptors

CB1 and CB2 endocannabinoid receptors, which are found on cell surfaces throughout the body, are
believed to be more numerous than any other cellular receptor signaling system in the human body.
The CB1 receptors are located primarily in the brain, central nervous system and other tissues; these
receptors play a modulatory role in memory, mood, sleep, appetite and pain sensation. The CB2 recep-
