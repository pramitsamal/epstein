Vapor

While vapor remains the major market share gainer across adult use cannabis, CBD only
offerings are much smaller, but represent a solid growth segment. Over the next two
years, we believe the category can generate over $350 mm in revenues, with upside if
consumer adoption of this particular form factor resembles the adult use market for
THC, or the growing popularity of nicotine vapor. We benchmark the market
opportunity against the U.S. e-cigarette category, which we are forecasting to grow
~32% in 2019 and ~27% in 2020, resulting in revenues surpassing $11 bn in 2020. In
addition to e-commerce, we believe there will be distribution channel overlap with e-
cigs, with a focus on vape shops and convenience stores (as opposed to just
dispensaries). If vapor generates $360 mm in revenues in 2020, that would result in an
implied market share of 3.2%, roughly 10% of JUUL’s current U.S. market share.

The below scenario analysis shows that every 50 bps of market share capture is worth
~$56 mm in revenues. While we are forecasting CBD vape to be ~3% of the market, we
believe there is upside to these numbers and that strong consumer adoption can result
in revenues surpassing $500 mm.
