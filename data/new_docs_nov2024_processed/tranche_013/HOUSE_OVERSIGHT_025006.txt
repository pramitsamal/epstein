Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat on

statehood moves at U.N.
Edmund Sanders

September 6, 2011 -- Palestinians have everyone guessing about their
next move. Defying the United States and Israel, the Palestinian
Authority is expected this month to apply for full membership in the
United Nations. If the Obama administration vetoes the application in
the Security Council as expected, Palestinian officials are likely to
turn to the General Assembly to upgrade their status from non-
member entity to non-member state. Gaining de facto statehood
recognition from the international body could allow Palestinians to
join key U.N. institutions, such as the International Criminal Court.
Palestinian leaders say they have enough votes for such a move. But
with two weeks before the General Assembly convenes, they have
remained vague about their exact plans, and have refused to say
exactly what a U.N. membership application or General Assembly
resolution might say. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, a member
of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee,
discussed with The Times what Palestinians are planning and why he
thinks the U.N. bid, if unsuccessful, could spell the end of the
Palestinian Authority.

There's been a flurry of last-minute pressure from the U.S. and
Mideast ''quartet to convince Palestinians to shelve the U.N.
membership bid. [White House envoys David Hale and Dennis
Ross arrived in the region Tuesday.] Any chance of that
happening?
