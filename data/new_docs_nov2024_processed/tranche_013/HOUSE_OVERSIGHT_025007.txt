Why? I don't see any contradiction between an effort to revive peace
talks and our going to the U.N. Also, [for all practical purposes] we
are already at the U.N. It's there.... And all those who support the
1967 lines [the border before Israel seized the West Bank during that
year's Middle East War] with mutually agreed swap [of land] should
support our endeavor.

The Obama administration doesn't support your bid, though it
supports using the 1967 lines with swaps as the baseline for the
border of a Palestinian state.

We urge the U.S. to see it the way it is. We are trying to preserve the
two-state solution in the face of an Israeli government that is
determined to destroy it. Going to the U.N. is an attempt to preserve
the two-state solution so Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side
in peace and security.

What's your plan if the U.S. vetoes full membership? Have
Americans told you they will veto?

The U.S. told us that the U.N. is not an option they will support. I
hope they will not veto. How will they explain a veto?

They say that direct negotiation with Israel is the only way to
reach a deal.

What have we been doing for the past 20 years? What have we been
doing since [President George H.W.]| Bush told us that if we
recognize Israel, accept the two-state solution and renounce violence,
the U.S. will stand shoulder to shoulder with us?
