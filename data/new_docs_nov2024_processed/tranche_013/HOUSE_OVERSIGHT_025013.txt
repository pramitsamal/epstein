SPIEGEL: Many Arabs now feel that your institution is not very
efficient.

Elaraby: The historic moment of change has gripped the entire
region, and sooner or later it will change all Arab countries. The
League will certainly need to adjust to that. We must be capable of
reacting quickly to unexpected developments.

SPIEGEL: Surely there are a few member states, most notably Saudi
Arabia, which will hardly support such changes.

Elaraby: I too have my doubts there. Nevertheless, we still have to
try, and we have to take seriously the human rights established by the
UN, which all countries in the League have recognized.

SPIEGEL: How does Saudi Arabia's foreign minister explain that
his country supports the Syrian opposition, on the one hand, while at
the same time sending troops to Bahrain?

Elaraby: I don't ask him these questions. That's your job. You're the
journalists.

SPIEGEL: Do you support the Palestinian Autonomous Authority in
its aspiration to have the UN General Assembly give its blessing in
September to the establishment of a State of Palestine?

Elaraby: UN Resolution 181, adopted in 1947, is the birth certificate
for two nations, Israel and Palestine. What's wrong with the
Palestinians appealing directly to the UN after 20 years of
negotiations with Israel? They could spend another 20 years
negotiating without results, because the Israeli government doesn't
even want to put an end to the conflict. The Israelis are only serious
about gaining more land and expanding the settlements.
