However, I have had an abortion, and I was totally outraged by the blatant hypocrisy I’d overheard. I had never

leaked a document before, but my anger overshadowed my fear.

I chose Nina Totenberg because I had come to trust her reporting about the Supreme Court on National
Public Radio. I honestly had no idea what leaking the affidavit would accomplish. I certainly did not envision
that it would literally embarrass the Senate into delaying the vote until public hearings were held, though that

probably was my secret desire.

But Judge Thomas testified under oath that he had never discussed the subject of abortion. However, in
response to a question by Senator Hank Brown, Professor Hill testified that she had disagreed with Judge Thomas

in a discussion about Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, then-Senator Joseph Biden quickly interrupted her.
“That is not the subject of these hearings,” he said.

Personally, I feel quite disappointed about that particular aspect of the testimony, but I have not the slightest

regret over leaking Anita Hill’s affidavit, and I would gladly do it all over again.

I certainly set a higher moral standard for myself than did the staffer for Senator John Danforth who wrote

Judge Thomas’s statement that began, “Nobody helped me with this.”
