come from the states, may be underestimated. A 2011 analysis by the Joint Economic Committee shows that lower
portfolio return assumptions on pension assets sharply increase the magnitude of underfunded pensions (see chart, right).

However, there’s more of an effort at the state/local level to address this issue than at the Federal level. More than
40 states lowered pension benefit liabilities over the last 3 years according to the National Conference of State
Legislatures. Measures taken include raising employee contributions (while lowering employer payments), raising
minimum retirement ages, cutting post-employment healthcare benefits and in some cases, switching to defined
contribution from defined benefit plans.

The good news, to paraphrase Mark Twain, is that reports of municipal bonds’ demise have been greatly

exaggerated. From 1970 through to the end of 2011, municipal bonds rated by Moody’s experienced a grand total of 71
defaults among 17,700 issuers (11 of which occurred during 2010 and 2011). General obligation bonds accounted for 5
defaults; 29 were related to housing; 22 for hospitals and healthcare; 3-4 each for education and infrastructure. Utilities
and cities registered 2 each, while counties, special districts, and water & sewer and experienced | each. The average
recovery for defaulted munis was 65%, compared to 49% on corporate senior unsecured bonds. Last comment on
municipals: while /oca/ tax collections are weak due to the collapse in home prices, state tax collections have been
increasing for 7 quarters in a row.

OK, so the US economy is improving, but is still heavily dependent on monetary and fiscal stimulus to grow, and the only
belt-tightening one can find is at the state and local level. Since 2009, after equities collapsed and bond prices rose, how
have many investors reacted?

By selling more equities and buying a lot more bonds. See chart above (a global version of this chart looks roughly the
same).

Have investors been positioning this way since stocks are expensive?

Not really. Insert a giant martini glass on the chart below from 1998 to 2001 (I hate using simple averages which include
periods when the market had lost its collective mind). The current P/E multiple is in the middle of the ex-bubble range of
the last 25 years. Some bank stocks look interesting, even after accounting for reliance on shrinking loan loss reserves to
