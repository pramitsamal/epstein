drive income, and ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Most US banks are at or close to Basel 3 funding needs, have

considerably fewer capital adequacy questions than their European counterparts, and do not rely on wholesale funding to
finance loan portfolios.

Now that P/E multiples have risen off the bottom, what’s the outlook for P/E multiples and earnings from here?

The return on the S&P this year has been a function of P/E multiples rising (from 11.3x to 12.9x), a big part of which has
been Apple (3% of the S&P index, 15% of S&P’s YTD returns). As shown below, earnings revisions have been negative
for 2012, but analysts are still optimistic about 2013. According to Morgan Stanley, analysts are forecasting the highest

percentage of companies posting 2013 margin expansion since 1970, and by a very wide margin. In our view, it will be

difficult for multiples to rise further unless earnings outperform expectations, particularly if Europe’s structural problems
take center stage again.

The place that worries me the most: Spain. It ranks at or close to the bottom in a lot of categories (see table), and its
growth outlook is poor. Historically, this kind of thing has not ended well. Spain has defaulted 13 times since 1500 AD;
it’s probably going to take a lot of bilateral aid and ECB financing to prevent another one.
