Despite the more favorable view on asset growth, the alterna-
tive asset mangers continue to trade at a significant P/E discount
to traditionals. The group currently trades at 10.8x MSe 2018 EPS,
a 3.0x turn discount to traditionals peers. This however is on total
earnings per share, and is inclusive of performance fees which inves-
tors use a Lower multiple on given volatility. However, we believe a
re-rating of the management fee portion of earnings ina SOTP valua-

tion alone could help close the overall P/E gap vs. traditionals.

B) Longer-term capital that is committed for a defined period of
time and pays fees with an average duration of 12 years in a typical
drawdown fund. As you can see in the following exhibit based on full-
year 2016 data, we see larger redemption rates from traditionalasset
managers (those that disclose redemption rates) relative to alts. For
traditionals we look at total redemption rates. For the alternatives
we look at realizations/harvesting of investments along with
redemptions of open ended products from fee paying AUM as it is
more comparable to traditional asset managers. If we take 1 divided
by the redemption rate, we can back into an average duration of
assets under management. For traditionals below (both covered and

non covered), this equates to 4.3 years duration and for the alterna-
