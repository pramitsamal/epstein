C) Management fees that are paid on committed money rather
than net asset value. This provides much more stability and down-
side protection, but limits upside to management fees as invest-
ments appreciate in value do not automatically translate into higher
mgmt fees. The Alts then participate in investment performance
through performance fees or carried interest, whereas the tradi-
tionals participate in performance via greater management fees ona

higher value of invested assets.

D) Relatively more insulation from fee pressure in private mar-
kets given limited low cost competitors (indexed funds and ETFs for
traditionals) and higher demand for products driven by the search for
higher return and diversification from investors. In fact, recent
demand for some PE funds has actually led to supply constraints and
allowed Alts to give less fee concessions. Apollo, for example, closed
fundraising for their flagship Fund IX last year at $24b, but the
demand was 25% higher at $30b. As a result, the company said eco-
nomics to Apollo for Fund IX are considerably better since we did not
need to provide as many management fee discounts. This supports
the forward look on growth in management fee revenues; however,
we could see some mix shift into lower return profile (and Lower fee)

products that could begin to pressure fee rates over time.

2) Publicly Traded Alts Comps

We see Hamilton Lane (HLNE, Equal-weight) and Partners Group
(PGHN, Equal-weight, covered by Anil Sharma) as offering an
upside scenario for Alts©fee-related earnings multiples.
Hamilton Lane is ~90% fee earnings and currently trades at 23.4x
multiple on our CY2018e EPS. Similar to alternative asset manager
peers, the company gets paid management fees on drawdown funds
and customized separately managed accounts with stable fees paid
on committed capital. PGHN is a publicly traded alternative asset
manager in Switzerland, and as a C-corporation it is the closest true
comp for HLNE.

While we see the publicly traded C-corps as good comps, there

are several factors that could be elevating the multiples. HLNE is
a small cap stock with $2b market cap and may not be the best comp
for the large cap PE firms. The company has limited float (currently
at ~25%) and scarcity value as the only US based publicly traded alt
in a C-corp structure. PGHN is a trades in Europe and may not be a
great comp because of that. Lastly, while not drastically different,
HLNE and PGHN have had higher organic growth historically and
looking out over the next 2 years we expect their growth to outpace
most of the alts. As aresult of the high multiples at the public C-corp
alts, we have heard partnership alts increasingly use HLNE as a peer

comp.
