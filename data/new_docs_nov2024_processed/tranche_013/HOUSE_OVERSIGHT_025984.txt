Week in review & notable trends (US)

US equities at new all-time highs on upbeat employment report

Both the S&P500 and NASDAQ finished the week higher marking fresh all-time highs as
the July nonfarm payrolls and average hourly earnings came in better-than-expected. As
a result, VIX fell to its lowest levels since Jul-14 and the SPX ly vs. 1m ATMf implied vol
spread rose to its highest level in almost four years on lower short dated vol.

Across other asset classes, the USD finished with gains against other major currencies,
while Treasury yields rose across the curve, which partly explained the outperformance
(underperformance) in Financials (Utilities) (i.e., +1.7% and -2.7%, respectively).

Most companies (86% as of 5-Aug) in the SPX have reported Q2 results and the blended
(actual + estimated) yoy earnings decline for Q2-2016 now stands at -3.5%, less than
the expected decline of -5.5% as of 30-Jun. Analysts expect CY16 earnings decline of -

0.3% which would mark the first time SPX has reported two consecutive years of
earnings decline since 2008. Earnings growth is now expected to resume in Q4-16.

With SPX rallying on a stronger-than-expected July jobs report,
SPX implied vol took a further leg down, especially in the
shorter end of the vol curve. Indeed, SPX 1m ATMf implied vol
ended the week at 9.1 vol pts, within striking distance of its 2-
year lows.

On the other hand, longer dated ATMf implied vols did not fall
nearly as much causing a material steepening in the vol term
structure. For instance, the lyr-1m implied vol spread reached
its highest level since 27-Sep-12 (6.4 vol pts).

Since its peak in Jul-15, the Biotech sector (NBI Index) has been
on one of its worst runs in decades, underperforming the broad
market benchmark (SPX) by a whopping ~30% on a total return
basis. However, more recently the sector has regained some
lost ground on solid large-cap earnings reports (i.e., +13.2%
since 1-Jul, 9.3% above the SPX).

While short-dated implied vol has dropped considerably as a
consequence of the recent rally, it still remains supported on a
5-yr basis. Also, upside vol has been richening vs. ATM vol, with
the 1m IBB ATM-110 implied vol spread reaching its lowest
level in five years on 4-Aug and finishing the week at 1.2 vol pts
(3 5-yr %-ile).

Investors with a constructive view on the sector who are
concerned about a reversal of the recent gains should consider
replacing or initiating long position via short dated ATM calls
partially financed by expensive OTM calls.
