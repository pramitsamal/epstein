adjustment = we adjust the VIX futures curve to reflect the Trade-Day/252 day-count convention and
use SQRT ((30/365*252/T}) as the adjustment factor to convert to the common day-count
convention used in variance swaps. Term-structure adjustment = we add the median level of the day-
count adjusted generic 1m/2m/3m fly (ie. -0.5x Sep fut. +1xOct fut. -0.5x Nov fut) to take into
account the usual VIX term structure.

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. Data from Nov-28 to Aug-16.

Using the VIX term structure in the Sep/Oct/Nov buckets and
adjusting for term structure/day convention (see footnote to
Chart 13), we estimate the option markets’ implied move over a
single day in the Oct-Nov period (which encompasses the US
election on 8-Nov).

Our estimated implied move is 1.4% which is notably very close
to the typical 1-day post-election day SPX realized move over
past election cycles (1.5% since 1928) (see Chart 14).

Importantly, there is a larger-than-typical variation in the
distribution of all daily post-election SPX returns (34.0 vol pts
vs. 18.4 vol pts for daily SPX returns since Jan-1928), with the
largest and the fourth largest daily post-election SPX returns
since 1928 occurring in the last two election cycles alone (see
Chart 14).

Hence, investors who believe this /s not your typical election (to
quote President Obama at the latest Democratic National
Convention) may still find that option markets are currently
pricing too little of a move.

However, as we have recently argued the debate about whether
a Trump win would be good or bad for markets coupled with the
inability to exactly pinpoint real risks are likely headwinds to a
sizeable market shock.
