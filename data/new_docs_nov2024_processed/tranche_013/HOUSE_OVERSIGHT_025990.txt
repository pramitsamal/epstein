Current vega outstanding near at least 2.5y high as European Issuance picks up
We estimate the current vega outstanding in SX5E-linked products (issued in Europe
and Korea) sums up to €143Mnh, which is in its 97 percentile since Jan-14 (when our
records begin). Moreover, this could rise to as much as €169Mn if the SX5E rallies to
3280 (assuming no net SX5E-linked issuance', Chart 25, 26 and Chart 27).
