You were good.

Thought if u didn’t know that we had been a couple she gave it away w familiarity and barbed
comments.

Think for now I’m going nowhere with her except economics mentor.

I think I’m right now in the seen very warmly in rear view mirror category.
She did not want to have a drink cuz she was “tired”

I left the hotel lobby somewhat abruptly.

When I’m reflective I think I’m dodging a bullet. There are huge ups with her but very self

Think right thing is to cut off contact. Suspect she will miss it. Problem is I will too.
