The world is moving rapidly from the model we have
lived within for 25 years. The where, why and what...

LONG TERM OUTLOOK:

- Geopolitical events are increasingly pressuring global markets and will continue to do
so for the remainder of 2015 and well into 2016.

- Middle East serves as locus for key uncertainty and chaos. We continue to believe the
region is at risk of remaining in turmoil for 30+ years .

- We continue to see NAFTA nations as being seen as economic and political “safe
havens” in large part to “Energy Renaissance.”

- China is going through intense political, economic and societal transformation — all of
which could potentially overwhelm the chances of a successful outcome.

SHORT TERM (3-10 month) OUTLOOK:

- In the coming three to six months, three key events will likely happen and have a long
term positive impact on markets:

> Approval and implementation of Iran nuclear negotiations
> Congressional approval of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
> USwill approve repeal ban on export of crude oil/natural gas
