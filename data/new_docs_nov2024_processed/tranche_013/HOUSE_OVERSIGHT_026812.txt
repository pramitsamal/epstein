Libya: Is there any hope for peace or will it become a

hub for regional instability and violence? No and yes

-The US/EU/NATO toppling of long-time
strongman Muammar Gaddafi has led to a
cycle of instability and continuous violence.

- It has also led to severe cuts in oil production
and loss of significant revenue.

- More importantly, Gaddafi’s massive weapons
stocks have directly flowed to Boko Haram in
Nigeria, terrorist groups in Mali and to arm
other movements in Tunisia — as well as
financing them via the sales and trading of
these weapons.

- The US and EU seem to have no strategy to
deal with the situation. White House sources
tell us “it has literally fallen off the table” as an
issue of focus. Is this now Egypt’s problem
through which the US will send
money/weapons?
