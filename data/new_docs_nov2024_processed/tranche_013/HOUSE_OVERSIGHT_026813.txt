Conflict in Ukraine: is it all over but for the shooting?

Ukraine Lines of Withdrawal

- Moscow got what it wanted: securing
the naval port in Sevastopol and creating
a buffer state between Ukraine and
Russia as well as keeping Kiev weak and
unstable.

- But there has been a cost: Sanctions
are crushing the Russian economy and
Crimea has become a giant money pit for
Putin to pour rubles into. A complete
economic mess.

- However, do not exclude possibility of
more violence in Ukraine or elsewhere in
the region. eee
- Still waiting for any significant financial
aid or military relief from EU or US. Word
to the wise: do not hold your breath.

- One other conflict is now drawing in
Russian troops: Syria. Russian pilots are
now flying missions with Syrian Air Force.
