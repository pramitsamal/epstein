In March 2001, Mezvinsky was indicted and later pleaded guilty to 31
of 69 counts of federal criminal bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud.

Ed Mezvinsky embezzled more than $10 million dollars from people
via both a Ponzi scheme and the notorious Nigerian e-mail scams.

He was found guilty and sentenced to 80 months in federal prison.

After serving less than five years in federal prison, he was released in
April 2008 and remains on federal probation.

To this day, he still owes $9.4 million in restitution to his many
victims.

About now you are saying, “So what!”

Well, this is Marc and Chelsea Mezvinsky.

That’s right; Ed Mezvinsky is Chelsea Clinton's father-in law.

Now Marc and Chelsea are in their early thirties and purchased a $10.5
million NYC apartment.
