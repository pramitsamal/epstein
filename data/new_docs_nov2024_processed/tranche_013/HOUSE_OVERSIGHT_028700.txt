activities. The Majlis al-Shura considers all
elements of the group's activities, including
its political and military wings, as part of
one holistic entity.

According to Hezbollah's top officials, this
unity of purpose among the group's diverse
activities is essential to its success. If the
military wing were separated from the
political wing, this would have
repercussions, and it would reflect on the
political scene, Qassem told a Lebanese
paper in 2000. Hezbollah's secretary-
general is the head of the Shura Council
and also the head of the Jihad Council, and
this means that we have one leadership,
with one administration.

The Jihad Council is the functional council
underneath the Majlis al-Shura responsible
for all military matters. Qassem writes that
it comprises those in charge of resistance
activity, be that in terms of oversight,
recruitment, training, equipment, security,
or any other resistance-related endeavors.
To accomplish its mission, the council is
divided into several smaller units in charge
of protecting the leadership and carrying
out internal and external surveillance, as
well as overseas operations. The party's
security branch is further broken down into
three subgroups: central, preventive, and
overseas security. In 2000, a dedicated
counterintelligence branch was reportedly
founded as well.
