hills, valleys, and rising apartment blocks --
the future he was in the process of building
-- stretched out in front of him.

One-third of Palestine and Israel. Rawabi
is in the second-largest, yet most sparsely-
populated Area A in the West Bank -- from
the terrace, which faces away from Ateret,
you can see expanses of mostly-empty
hills. Perhaps in Masri's mind, they are
awaiting Rawabis of their own. When I
returned to Washington, I asked him in a
phone interview if he viewed his project as
the first of many such planned cities in
Palestine. I always say our success 1s
measured not by how many homes we sell.
It is measured when a second Rawabi is
established,” he told me.

Standing on the terrace, I asked him if his
willingness to undertake such a massive
project reflected any optimism about the
coming years -- no one invests this much
time, money, and energy into something if
they expect war is on the horizon. This
project is built for today's politics, he
replied. If it gets a little worse, or a little
better -- fine. If it gets really bad, we're in
trouble. If it doesn't, then great. We're not
waiting on a breakthrough.

He estimated that Israeli obstruction had
delayed the project by a year and a half.
