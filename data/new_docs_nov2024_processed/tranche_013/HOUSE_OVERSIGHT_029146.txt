* Other possibile areas you suggest

We would like to set a mutually agreed schedule so we can confirm and reserve the Closer To Truth
‘season’ of 13 episodes for 'Radical Breakthroughs’, which we need to plan well in advance - especially as
we begin 2018.

See you Jan. 5 - Looking forward to brainstorming.

Robert
