Hi Lawrence,
just back from a long tour ,,on origins”.
As promised you will get my message promptly.

As you may understand, before we start recruiting for the Festival our budget
implies more freedom. Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily
on amounts in ,,kilos“. (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before
deadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum).

What I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment.
I deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines.
So please let me know if you can or cannot come.

As ever Jakob
