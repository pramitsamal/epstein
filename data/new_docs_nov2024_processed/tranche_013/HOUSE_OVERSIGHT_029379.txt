the Palestinians, though the effort did
not succeed. Nor did we succeed
(Rabin and Peres, myself, Olmert and
Bibi as well). They shouldn't be
ridiculed and debased for this. They
should be appreciated. Even if we do
not agree on all the details.

¢ We will yet need their help in
facing many trials in the future.

¢ J recommend that we all
remember this well. The rules of
working with the Americans: Do not
marginalize yourself. Do not fold. Yes
— remember what the U.S. is for Israel.
And Maintain—at almost any cost —
mutual relations of trust and respect.
It's good for Israel.

¢ The American Congress,
President Obama, Biden and Kerry are
part of the solution, even if it tarries.
