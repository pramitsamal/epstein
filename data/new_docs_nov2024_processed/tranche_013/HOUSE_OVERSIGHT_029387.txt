entire economy forward together with
the chance for stability and peace
,based on synergies and collaboration
rather than hatred and revenge.

¢ What do I mean? The events in
recent years have created a strong
common interest for Israel and the
moderate Arab countries — Saudi
Arabia and the Gulf States, Jordan,
Egypt and perhaps even Turkey (which
is not Arab). The focal interest is the
struggle against radical Islamic
terrorism and against Iran's hegemonic
and nuclear intentions.

¢ The challenge for us is based
on there being, apparently, only one
way to achieve that; and the upcoming
elections in Israel force us to put it on
hold for a few months.
