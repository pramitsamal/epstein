Alan Trounson, California's Dr. Stem Cell -- latimes.com Page 4 of 4

You have a heart condition; will this research one day benefit you?

I've got atrial fibrillation; I don't think it's going to help that. But I have a brother who has HIV/AIDS,
and my mum died of lung disease.

What do you hear from your colleagues around the world about what California's doing?
They always say, You've got the best job in the world. How did California do this?” That's
California. California is a can-do place, and when they want something, they stand up and do it. Many

of [my colleagues] want to come to California. It's just a wonderful place. You could sail it off the
coast of America and it would be the most wonderful country in the world.
