narrow maritime confines like the Suez
Canal, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf.

But the likely proliferation of nuclear
weapons -- and ballistic missile delivery
systems -- will pose even more
formidable challenges to conventional
military surges in the region. In the
future, the United States will not be able
to take for granted unchallenged surges
of naval, air, and ground forces into
regional theaters via logistics hubs. These
hubs -- like the American naval presence
in Bahrain -- are large, readily
identifiable, and will be increasingly
vulnerable to future targeting by nuclear
weaponry.

Iran's nuclear weapons, assuming it gets
them, will pose a direct threat to
American military surge capabilities.
Although American policymakers and
military commanders might feel
confident that they could surge forces
into the Gulf despite Iranian nuclear
threats because of the American nuclear
deterrent, Gulf security partners might be
more nervous and less willing to
cooperate. As a result, they might not
grant access to U.S. air, naval, and
ground forces out of fear of angering
Iran.

American observers who doubt that Gulf
states would make such calculations
should recall how Kuwait responded in
