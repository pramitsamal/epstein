democratization, and it maintains
political and diplomatic ties with both
Arab states and Iran. China's military
activity in the region is modest but
increasing, as evidenced by its recent
peacekeeping dispatches to the region
and naval port visits in the Gulf. Beying

Gulf to increase its presence there and
enhance its ability to protect the sea lanes
which bring oil to China's thirsty
economy. China is keenly aware that the
United States has naval supremacy in the
Gulf, but will be working to erode that
strategic edge in the future.

Faced with these realities, there is a need
for new thinking and innovative
conceptualizations of surges into
Centcom's area of responsibility. Theater
campaign planners will have to think
about contingencies in which the United
States cannot slowly and methodically
build up forces in the region and then
kick off campaigns after most troops,
arms, and equipment are in place. Future
U.S. force build-ups in the region will be

strikes. As a result, planners will have to
devise campaign plans in which the
insertion of U.S. military forces begins
