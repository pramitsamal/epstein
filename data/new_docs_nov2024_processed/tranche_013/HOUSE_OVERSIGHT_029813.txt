with an immediate rolling and flowing
start. The United States will have to work
from smaller troop footprints and be
prepared to start fighting even as follow-
on-forces are on the way. Ideally, these
forces would flow from multiple staging
positions to reduce vulnerability to
nuclear attack. The politics of the region,
however, will work against securing a
multitude of staging areas from which to
deploy.

The region under the purview of
Centcom has always been riddled with
political violence that has posed
formidable challenges to military
operations. But in plotting a course over
the horizon, the political and military
obstacles for American military surges
into the region are poised to grow even
larger. As a result, theater contingency
planners will have fewer good options for
projecting American military power into
the region -- and they'll have to do more
with the bad and the ugly.
