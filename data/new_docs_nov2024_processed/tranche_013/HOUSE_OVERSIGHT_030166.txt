That this idea is being introduced into the public discourse is
revealing, not only of Turkey's internal debate on this issue, but also
of the message that Ankara may be trying to send to the United States
and others: It needs time to develop the wherewithal to meaningfully
influence its neighborhood. The United States wants Turkey to help
shoulder the burden of managing the Middle East as it looks to
extricate its military from Iraq. Washington especially needs to
develop a strong counterbalance to Iran - a role historically filled by
Turkey. This obviously presents a conflict of interests: Washington is
trying to push Turkey into a role it's not quite ready for; meanwhile,
Turkey is trying to sort out its growing pains while appearing
influential abroad.

Turkey's evolution will be difficult and uncomfortable, but this
should not come as a surprise. Zero problems with neighbors
worked well for Turkey at the start of the century, as it came out of its
domestic shell, yet took care to avoid being seen as a resurgent power
with imperial interests. After a decade of regional conflict, Turkey is
finding that problems with neighbors are not only unavoidable, but
may even be necessary as the Turkish state redefines its core interests.
