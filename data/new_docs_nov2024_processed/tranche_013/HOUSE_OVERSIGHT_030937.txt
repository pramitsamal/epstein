Walton's blanket defense of the Commission has made the Feds conclude he is a fool or co-conspirator.

The FBI just needs the evidence and not much of it. To quote the late Supreme Court Justice William
Brennan: any prosecutor worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich.

This means all evidence, regardless of its sanibigupns nature, will be interpreted to support their
assumption of wrongdoing.

They will be using software to go through millions of E-mail messages to look for key words. As Buddy
has quoted me: The 'E’ in E-mail stands for evidence.”

Six months from now they uncover an E-mail from the County Manager to Walton stating that
Commissioner X wants te know if the bid of company Y for new busses was correctly filled out. He
replies that it was.

Months later he has totally forgotten about the innocuous Eumail. Based on the merits, he happens to
rank Y's bid number one.

“You can bet as sure as “J . Edgar Hoover wore pink poodle skirts, the FBI will conclude this was code
from Commissioner X to Walton to vote for Y.

Armed with the E-mail you can be damn sure that the G-Men will be back threatening him with
everything including a stint in Gitmo.

_All of this might have been avoided if he had followed my three basic rules.
Mermorize them. | |

3. Do not talk to the FBI without a law
