Good God! Anything is better than just giving it to Hilary and her

despicable husband.

Thanks for including Jefferson and von Mises, my favorite Galician, in
the list of good guys. Our economy cannot be repaired without
dismantling the Fed. As you often point out, our monetary system is

rotten at the core, as it is based on credit.

I read in one of these letters from a libertarian source that Jefferson
wrote, already in 1810 or so, that he had failed to set up a free country
as he envisioned... and that was still more than 100 years before the

Federal Reserve Act.

On the other hand, even today, I strongly believe that if we just followed
the Constitution, we would be okay — especially the 1oth amendment. I

think that is the most important of all.

In the words of Warren Zevon, “Send lawyers, guns, and money; the s---

has hit the fan.”

The Democratic Party is electing a known criminal, and they don’t care,
as long as it’s their criminal. They just assume all politicians are
criminal, and the really good ones get their districts what they need.
Would anyone let Harry Reid babysit their children? The Republican
Party is electing anybody who is not a politician. Donald Trump just

happens to be the best known, “anybody” who is running.
