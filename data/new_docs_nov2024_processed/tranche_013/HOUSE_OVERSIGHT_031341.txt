Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones threatened special counsel Robert Mueller during a Monday episode
of his InfoWars show, miming a shooting and saying he would die trying” to take Mueller down.

Jones began by making unfounded claims about Mueller and Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of
solicitation of a minor for prostitution in 2008.

That's the thing, is like, once it's Mueller, everyone's so scared of Mueller, they'd let Mueller rape
kids in front of people, which he did, Jones said. | mean, Mueller covered up for a decade for
Epstein kidnapping kids, flying them on sex planes, some kids as young as seven years old
reportedly, with big perverts raping them to frame people.
