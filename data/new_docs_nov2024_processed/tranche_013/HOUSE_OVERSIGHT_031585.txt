Cyprus problem is literally obstructing the deepening of the EU-NATO
strategic relations. The current crisis in Ukraine clearly highlighted, once
again, the need for closer cooperation between the two institutions.

External Dynamics Necessitating a Settlement

The crisis in Ukraine also brings forward the necessity of alternative
energy supplies en route to Europe. Recently, the island of Cyprus has
driven considerable attention as a result of the newly found energy
reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean. Common sense dictates that
Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, together with neighboring countries,
adopt a win-win approach and share the benefits of the natural resources
of the region on an equitable basis. Such cooperation and the resulting
interdependency could only bring much needed stability and prosperity to
the region and help restore the ties between Turkey and Israel.

The Promise of a Solution

Cyprus lies at a strategic crossroads between the East and the West.
However, as all these developments indicate, the island’s full potential can
only be utilized with the solution of the Cyprus problem. A solution will
not only provide for peace on the island, but will also prompt a wave of
cooperation in its wider region. Therefore, all relevant actors, including
the two sides on the island, should act in a spirit of good-will and
compromise in bringing an end to this half-century-old problem. The
Turkish Cypriot side is ready to do its utmost in this regard, with a view to
realizing the island’s destiny to become a hub for peace and stability rather
than a source of conflict and tension.
