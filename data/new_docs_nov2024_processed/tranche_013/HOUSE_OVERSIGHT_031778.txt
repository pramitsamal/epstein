for comment Tuesday. A message seeking comment from Geragos was also not returned.

Avenatti shot to national prominence last year representing Stormy Daniels, the porn
actress who took $130,000 from Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to stay quiet about her
affair with the future president and then sued to void the deal.

The brash lawyer seemed to relish needling Trump and others on countless cable news
appearances and on Twitter. He also faced mounting legal troubles in the form of a $10
million judgment stemming from the breakup of his old firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, and
accusations from former partners that he hid millions in assets. Avenatti also split with
Daniels in recent weeks.

Daniels said Monday she was saddened but not shocked by news of Avenatti's arrest,
and that he had dealt with her extremely dishonestly.

Despite the recent setbacks, Avenatti was back on Twitter less than 24 hours after his
arrest, saying Nike had made payments to the mother of Phoenix Suns player DeAndre
Ayton while he was a college player and to University of Oregon center Bol Bol.

A lot of people at Nike will have to account for their criminal conduct, starting with
Carlton DeBose & moving higher up. The diversion charade they orchestrated against me
will be exposed, he tweeted. DeBose is the head of Nike's youth basketball division.

A Nike spokesperson on Tuesday referred to a company statement that it has been
cooperating with a government investigation into NCAA basketball for more than a year,

and would not be extorted or hide information relevant to that probe.

The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, case number 19-mj-2927, in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York.
