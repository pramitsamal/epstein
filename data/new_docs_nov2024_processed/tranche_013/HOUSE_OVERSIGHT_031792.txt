Thank you for the email, however, in briefly reviewing LM’s responses, she mentions a Dr. Rishard. | have previously
asked your office to provide Dr. Rishard’s contact information. | have looked for an “Office of Palm Beach Doctors” and
and a “Dr. Rishard” and have been unable to locate either. Please provide me with contact information so that | may
obtain records. Thank you.
