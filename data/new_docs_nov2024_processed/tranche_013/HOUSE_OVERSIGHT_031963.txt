too much attention to the Middle East, and too little to Asia — must
embrace a shift in priorities.

Of course, in the midst of today’s ongoing Arab revolutions, America
cannot simply ignore the Middle East. Nor must the US give up hope
on the Israel-Palestine front, or on its efforts to contain Iran’s nuclear
ambitions. But it is in Asia that history is unfolding — and where the
US must define its long-term global strategy.

Must the US, as Henry Kissinger suggests in his latest book On
China, consider the prospect of a “Pacific Community” that, unlike
the Cold War-era Atlantic Community, is not based on common
culture and values in the face of a direct threat, but on common
interests in an “age of rebalancing of world order’’?

America’s resilience may contrast with Europe’s multiple
weaknesses. But resilience will not be enough. The US must get back
into shape to face tomorrow’s challenges, and that means restoring
economic growth, reducing deficits, and improving infrastructure.
Paradoxically, only a more confident America can accept a reduced
global status, because reconciling oneself to change is always easier
once one has taken the steps needed to adjust to it.
