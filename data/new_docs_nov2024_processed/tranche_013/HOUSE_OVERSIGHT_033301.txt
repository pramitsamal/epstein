Dear Barry,

When it comes to describing Donald Trump’s private jet, the word
“impressive” would be an understatement. The presumptive Republican Party
nominee bought the Boeing 757-200 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen
and he spared no expense kitting it out. Dubbed “Trump Force One,” the
luxurious jet is equipped with a shower, gold-plated seatbelt buckles and a
52-inch flatscreen with a library of 1,000 movies. Built in 1991, the 757 is
estimated to have cost approximately $100 million. If Trump reaches the
White House in November, he'll have to exchange his personal jet for the
presidential fleet, two highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs. The aircraft used by
the president were built in 1986 and operate with the Air Force One callsign
when the president is onboard. Will switching jets prove one of Trump’s few
regrets if he becomes president?

Even though it cannot boast gold-plated accessories, Air Force One is a
larger aircraft, seating 70 passengers in comfort compared to Trump Force
