Brad —

In your answers to ROGS, you list Milton Center for girls as facility that Jane Doe attended. Milton Center is a
Department of Juvenile Justice facility; therefore | will need to get her records from DJJ. DJJ will not release the records
without a signed release by Jane Doe. | have attached a general HIPPA release for your review. Would you please
have Jane Doe sign it? DJJ does not have a standard form.

Also, will you agree to one more week on Responses to Net Wirth ROGS??
Please let me know.
