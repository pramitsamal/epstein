ambassador to help stop human trafficking. Ford sold her stake in the family business in 2007 to 
the private equity firm Stone Tower Equity. In her new life as a nearly full-time, unpaid, roving 
ambassador for the cause her job is an outgrowth of her former work, rather than a repudiation of 
it, or an atonement. 
Her interest in human trafficking began when a representative of the United Nations called to ask 
if she would participate in a women's leadership group that was studying the issue of trafficking. 
I said, 'I can't come talk about it, because I don't know anything about it! Ford recalls. But I 
went, and after two hours, I knew why I was there. The way people traffic across borders is 
parallel to the way we recruit models. According to Ford the target age is 14 to 24, and so it's 
41 
similar to modeling. I knew how to reach that market she said, It was the feeling of: There but 
for the grace of God... The girls who came to us could have been those girls.

Jeffrey Epstein doesn't want to be branded as a sex  
offender for life, and no, he's not a modeling agency secret 
sugar daddy (or so its owners say)

Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein, the billionaire money manager who's agreed to plead guilty to soliciting 
underaged hookers and go away for 18 months, doesn't want to be branded a sex offender for 
life. Page Six says his lawyers are thinking about asking prosecutors to drop that requirement 
from his plea agreement: 
In a letter drafted, but not sent, to U.S. 
Attorney Alexander Costa and obtained by Page Six, Epstein's lawyer, Gerald 
Lefcourt, writes, Doing so will have a profound impact [on Epstein] both 
immediately and forever after. Not only will he be restricted to a wholly 
inappropriate penal facility, but he will be required for the rest of his life 
to account for his whereabouts. 
Meanwhile, over the weekend Page Six said that owners of MC2 modeling, run by Jean-Luc 
Brunel — who's also been accused of favoring underaged models in the past — claim that 
Epstein is not the secret deep pockets behind the firm, no matter what others say or speculate. 
43 
Epstein, __reportedly gave 
millions to start MC2, which opened in October 2005 with offices in 
New York, Miami and Tel Aviv. One of the girls Epstein, 54, was accused of 
soliciting massages from was described in court documents as being just 14. 
E equals MC squared. . . get it, 
like the equation? E equals Epstein. He just thinks everyone is too dumb to 
figure it out, said a model industry insider. He's a desperate old 
man that fantasizes and takes advantage of young girls. 
Jeffrey Epstein has no ownership or involvement in our company and never has. Jean-Luc 
Brunel and I are the only two partners and owners of MC2 Model Management, [Jeffrey] Fuller 
said. [MC2 President]

The Volokh Conspiracy  
Eleventh Circuit rules that discovery can 
move forward on my Crime Victims' Rights 
Act case 
By Paul Cassell April 21 
On Friday,the Ilth Circuit ruled that discovery can move forward in an important Crime 
Victims' Rights Act case that my co-counsel, Brad Edwards, and I are pursuing. The narrow 
issue before the court was whether prosecutors and defense attorneys could assert some sort of 
privilege to prevent crime victims from reviewing the correspondence that lead to a plea 
bargain. More broadly, the ruling means that the victims will have a chance to return to the 
district court and seek to invalidate a plea agreement that (we alleged) was consummated in 
violation of their rights. I hope that the case will ultimately set an important precedent that 
federal prosecutors can't keep victims in the dark about the plea deals that they reach. 
Here are the important facts, taken from the 11th Circuit's opinion: The case arose in 2006, the 
FBI began investigating allegations that wealthy investor Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused 
dozens and dozens of minor girls. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida 
accepted Epstein's case for prosecution, and the FBI issued victim notification letters to my two 
clients, minors Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2, in June and August 2007. Extensive plea 
negotiations ensued between the prosecutors and Epstein. On Sept. 24, 2007, the prosecutors 
entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in which they agreed not to file any 
federal charges against Epstein in exchange for his guilty plea to minor Florida offenses (e.g., 
solicitation of prostitution). Not only did the prosecutors neglect to confer with the victims 
before they entered into the agreement with Epstein, they also concealed its existence for at least 
nine months. For example, the prosecutors sent post-agreement letters to the victims reporting 
that the case is currently under investigation and explaining that [t]his can be a lengthy 
process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation. 
On June 27, 2008, the prosecutors informed my co-counsel, Brad Edwards, that Epstein planned 
to plead guilty to the Florida charges three days later. But the prosecutors failed to disclose that 
Epstein's pleas to those state charges arose from his federal non-prosecution agreement and that 
the pleas would bar a federal prosecution. As a result, the victims did not attend the state court 
proceedings. 
45 
On July 7, 2008, Edwards and I filed a petition alleging that Jane Doe No. 1 was a victim of 
federal sex crimes committed by Epstein and that the United States had wrongfully excluded her 
from plea negotiations. We also alleged that the federal prosecutors had violated her rights under 
the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) — specifically her rights to confer with the government, 
to be treated with fairness, to receive timely notice of relevant court proceedings, and to receive 
information about restitution. The United States responded by claiming that it used its best 
efforts to comply with the rights afforded to victims under the CVRA, but that the act did not 
apply to pre-indictment negotiations with potential federal defendants. 
After Jane Doe No. 2 joined the initial petition, the district court (Marra, J.) found that both 
women qualified as crime victims under the CVRA. The district court later  rejected the  
government's argument that the act only applies after the filing of a federal criminal 
indictment. (I've written a law review article about the issue of how early crime victims' rights 
attach in the criminal process, which can be downloaded here.) 
Among other relief, we sought rescission of the non-prosecution agreement as a remedy for the 
violation of the victims' rights. To make the case for such a remedy, we moved for discovery of 
the correspondence between the U.S. and Epstein's attorneys during the plea negotiations. 
Epstein's attorneys intervened, arguing that Federal Rule of Evidence 410 and Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 11 create a privilege for plea negotiations, barring release of the 
correspondence. They also argued that the court should find that the materials were protected 
under the work product doctrine or, alternatively, should be protected under a new common-
law privilege for plea negotiations. 
The district court first ruled that rescission of the plea agreement was a possible remedy under 
the act. The court then ruled that we were entitled to review the correspondence, rejecting all of 
Epstein's arguments. 
On Friday, the 11th Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling that we could review the plea  
correspondence. At pp. 18-22 of its published opinion, the court concluded that there was no 
basis for restricting access to such correspondence when crime victims have a legitimate need to 
review it. The court rejected, for example, the work product argument because plea discussions 
are not confidential: 
Disclosure of work-product materials to an adversary waives the work-product privilege. See, 
e.g., In re Chrysler Motors Corp. Overnight Evaluation Program Litig., 860 F.2d 844, 846 (8th 
Cir. 1988); In re Doe, 662 F.2d 1073, 1081-82 (4th Cir. 1981). Even jilt shared the common 
goal of reaching a quick settlement, the United States was undoubtedly adverse to Epstein during 
its investigation of him for federal offenses, and the intervenors' disclosure of their work product 
waived any claim of privilege. 
The court also declined to recognize a new privilege for plea bargaining, finding the relationship 
between prosecutors and defense attorneys did not need special protection: 
As a last-ditch effort, the intervenors contend that [i]f more is needed in addition to the plain 
language of Rule 410 to preclude disclosure of the correspondence to plaintiffs, it can be found 
46 
in the conjunction of Rule 410, the work-product privilege, and the Sixth Amendment right to 
the effective assistance of counsel in the plea bargaining process, but this novel argument fails 
too. As explained above, Rule 410 does not create a privilege and the intervenors waived any 
work-product privilege. The intervenors concede too that the right to counsel under the Sixth 
Amendment had not yet attached when the correspondence was exchanged. Lumley v. City of 
Dade City, Fla., 327 F.3d 1186, 1195 (11th Cir. 2003) (111he Sixth Amendment right to 
counsel ordinarily does not arise until there is a formal commitment by the government to 
prosecute, such as a formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or 
arraignment.). The conjunctive power of three false claims of privilege does not rescue the 
correspondence from disclosure. . . . 
The Supreme Court has identified several considerations relevant to whether a court should 
recognize an evidentiary privilege—the needs of the public, whether the privilege is rooted in the 
imperative for confidence and trust, the evidentiary benefit of the denial of the privilege, and any 
consensus among the states, Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U.S. 1, 10-15 (1996)—but none of these 
considerations weighs in favor of recognizing a new privilege to prevent discovery of the plea 
negotiations. Although plea negotiations are vital to the functioning of the criminal justice 
system, a prosecutor and target of a criminal investigation do not enjoy a relationship of 
confidence and trust when they negotiate. Their adversarial relationship, unlike the confidential 
relationship of a doctor and patient or attorney and client, warrants no privilege beyond the terms 
of Rule 410. See Jaffee, 518 U.S. at 10. But the victims would enjoy an evidentiary benefit from 
the disclosure of plea negotiations to prove whether the United States violated their rights under 
the Act. 
Moving forward, this case raises the important issue of what kinds of remedies are available for 
violations of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. Our complaint alleges that, prodded by Epstein, the 
federal prosecutors deliberately concealed the sweetheart plea deal they had reached with him to 
avoid public criticism of the deal. I am hopeful that in future district court proceedings, we will 
be able to prove that clear violation of the CVRA and then obtain the remedy of invalidating the 
illegally-negotiated plea deal.

Dear JeanLuc, 
Unfortunately I need to announce that Liza Zazdravnih rejected signing the contract with MC2 in United 
Sates. Initially she intended to sign the contract, but later on she came across that article in internet about 
you involved in illegal activities with young models. This information somehow changed her intentions 
completely. she is ready to be a model and consider contracts with other agencies, but she has 
suspicions that you will force her to illegal activities and she made the decision to don't put her self in risk. 
Lets keep in touch. I will be happy to work with you next time if we have another right model for you. Im 
upset that it didn't work out with Liza 
Sincerely,

Jean Luc, 
How are you? 
After so many years scouting for you and having a great network of agencies all around the world who 
enjoy to work with us, i wanted to let you know that we are on the way to lose everything we build and we 
are gonna have big problem now. 
Agencies, still want to work with us but parents don't want their daughters to come to us, because when 
they google your name and the agency name the only things they see is Sex Trafficking!!! 
It's impossible to sign a new girl and if nothing it's done i can tell you that in 3 months we we will not get 
any new girls and i don't see how the agency will work without new faces. 
All the agencies who know you don't have any problems with you since they all told me We know Jean 
Luc for more than 20 years and all those years we had so many girls place with him who had better 
experience than in any other agencies who were representing them as well and we never had any 
problems whatsoever, all our girls had great carriers as a model when he represented them. 
I understand those agencies because it's hard for them to talk to parents and explain that it's not the truth 
when it's all over the internet. 
You need to have it stop and have the people write an official letter to say that it's not the truth... 
I will keep you posted of course but it's really bad for us and the scouting. 
Best regards

We took notes of your comments and the girls that you like on our website. 
We know Jean Luc Brunel and we always work with him since more than 10 years all 
those years and never had any problems. 
All the girls he represented from us never had any problems, they were working have 
great book work with good clients in editorial and campaigns and were well represented 
models. 
Now for all the new faces we have, we needed to talk to their parents to discuss about 
mc2 and you interest to represent their daughters and of course they google it and saw all 
the had articles about sex trafficking they were scared and I was myself speechless since 
we know that it's not true but it was hard for us to explain to the parents. 
So of course for the moment till all is clarified we can't place any new faces with you 
because the parents will refuse and it makes us look had to propose the girls to your 
agency. 
We are sorry but you really need to clarify everything, till then we will have to cease any 
collaboration and we will have to refuse to let you represent any of our models. 
Sure you understand.

RE: 0-1 Non-immigrant Visa Petition on behalf of Jean Luc Brunel 
Dear Sir or Madam: 
It is an extreme pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for Mr. Jean 
Luc Brunel. I provide this recommendation based on my knowledgr and 
experience in the field of modling, due to my established reputation and 
work in the field as the Vladimir Yudashkin, director of I Mother Agency. 
Kiev. Ukraine 
I have known Jean Luc Brunel pmfeanongilly for 5everr4 years thmugh 
our wink together and, in my opinion, he is an ext*mely talented 
Individual with superb profettsional reputation. He is an !extraordinarily 
able coordinator who strives for and attains a level of merit in his wnrk 
that only a few of his contemporaries meet. He has the abilit3. to 
recognize the creative vision of his client within the time and budget 
through hbi careful and thoughtful choice, of model casting combined 
imktig his meticulous ability in the field. Jean Luc Brunel is a true find to 
our indusuy. 
Mere are plenty of or, directors out there, but none with: the depth and 
quality that Mr. Dninel possesses He is unlike anyone in this industry. 
sod I expect to see him continue to find great models in his successful 
career. Someone overflowing with talent as Jean Luc Brine] should be 
given every opportunity to work in the United States, where he will have 
the proper venues to showcase his extraordinary talents. 
Please do not hesitate tv contact me should you he :any questions 
regarding Ohs matter. Thank you for ynur time and:r6nsideration. 
'A. 
Sincerely, 
Vladimir Yudash
