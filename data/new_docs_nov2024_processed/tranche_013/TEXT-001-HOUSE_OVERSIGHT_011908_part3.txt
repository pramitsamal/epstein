To: Jean Luc Brunel 
Subject: RE: New York 
Jean Luc, 
I am really sorry you feel so bad and I know it has been a mental and psychological frustration. As you 
know I chose to partner with you due to your reputation in the business for being a top scout and 
developing a couple world class agencies in the past. I knew what you could bring and I knew what I 
could bring and contribute and I thought it would be a great partnership. Clearly, I never expected to 
have the level of challenges we have had recruiting new models over the last several years. I could have 
never foreseen the problem of your friendship with Jeffrey Epstein turning into the situation it has 
where you are seen as guilty by association when you have never done anything or even been convicted 
of a crime. Frankly, I don't understand the necessity for Conchita Sarnoff or anyone else to continue to 
defame your name and MC2 by association. 
It is true that we constantly have to justify ourselves when recruiting new models. The industry is 
extremely competitive and as a parent myself if faced by the same information and having to make a 
tough decision between too agencies I would not pick MC2 if I saw the article online about you. You 
have to read closely to see there is not a charge against you but the implication is strong and of course 
now days everyone believes everything they read online even more than the traditional newspapers of 
the past. 
I know you are now feeling like a liability to MC2. But you personally are not a liability to MC2 but this 
published information online is a liability. We are not a large enough company, nor do we have the 
capacity to fight this on a global level. On a google search in America we have put enough information 
online to not have it popping up so blatantly but we have no controls over the rest of the world or the 
finances to control this situation and we are affected as every major model agency recruits it's best 
models from all the various countries abroad. This has stunted our growth and our billing over the past 
6 or 7 years. In fact, we do not even know who avoids us based on finding this information. I have been 
surprised how challenging it is for us to grow due to this problem. 
I have also had a tremendous amount of worries from our clients that we are vendors for that are large 
American corporations likes Kohls, JC Penney, Sears, Nordstrom, Target, Neiman Marcus, Macys, Saks, 
Belk, and so forth that require vendor agreements and for us to be considered an upstanding 
company. It really worries me as some of those companies have disassociated themselves from what 
EXHIBIT K 
they believe to be questionable companies. So far that has not been a problem but it could come up in 
the future. 
The fact that you are requested for so many scouting events in various countries and cannot promote 
yourself properly to promote MC2 in the press due this problem has it's own sent of repercussions in 
terms of our global branding. In short, it has had a terrible effect on MC2 all around. I really urge you 
to solve this problem and get this removed from the internet so we can grow for the future. I've fought 
for MC2 and been extremely loyal but I must confess that I have even been feeling inadequate and 
questioning my ability as the leader of the organization. I can only attribute the fact that we have 
scraped by in the recession and barely survived in the past to your hard work, my hard work, and the 
tenacity of both of us combined. 
I can only imagine that if I am feeling inadequate and frustrated over a lack of growth of our company 
that you must feel even worse as you have had much greater success in your career and have operated 
at much higher standards in our industry in all areas from reputation, respect, admiration and monetary 
gains. I can even surmise you are probably feeling a level of depression and I have seen it in your highs 
and lows and when you have voiced your frustration. While I know you well and recognize you don't 
really go for the kind of advice I will offer; however, I think you should at least speak to someone neutral 
such as a therapist or a counselor to let your frustrations out and if you don't feel better and are still 
feeling down or depressed to see a medical doctor for your condition. You are such a positive person I 
hate to see you fighting what you feel is a hopeless battle. It is not hopeless you just need find a way to 
get that information offline and begin to repair your reputation. In the end I am afraid the damages are 
a lot more than you realize but let's keep fighting and moving forward as we have no choice. 
Thanks, 
Jeff

Woman who sued convicted billionaire over 
sex abuse levels claims at his friends 
By JOSH GERSTEIN I 
12/31/14 6:38 PM EST 
A woman allegedly kept as a sex slave by politically-connected billionaire investor Jeffrey 
Epstein, who went to jail for having sex with underaged girls, is accusing several prominent 
friends of the financier of having taken part in the debauchery, according to a new court filing. 
The woman—referred to in court papers as Jane Doe #3—leveled the allegations Tuesday 
against Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz and Britain's Prince Andrew, as well as 
British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and French model scout Jean Luc Brunel. 
Dershowitz flatly denied the claims about him Wednesday in an interview with POLITICO. 
It's totally, unequivocally and completely false, the celebrated attorney said. 
A spokesman for Prince Andrew denied the allegations Friday, while a lawyer who handled 
related matters for Maxwell did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Representatives of 
Brunel's modeling firm also did not reply to e-mail messages. 
The accusations came in a long-running lawsuit charging federal prosecutors in Florida with 
violating a victims-rights law by failing to consult with Epstein's victims before signing off on a 
plea deal. That pact ruled out any federal prosecution of the investor, who agreed to plead guilty 
to two state prostitution-related felony charges. Lawyers for the victims have described the 
arrangement as a sweetheart deal the well-connected Epstein and his high-powered legal team 
achieved by putting pressure on prosecutors. 
Epstein served 13 months of an 18-month sentence on the two state charges before being 
released in 2009. He's now a registered sex offender. 
The new court filing, submitted by Florida lawyer Brad Edwards and former federal judge Paul 
Cassell in a federal court in West Palm Beach, Fla., asked that Jane Doe #3 and another woman 
be allowed to join the pending case over the victims' rights claim. 
Epstein...trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including 
numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a 
well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to describe 
EXHIBIT R 
the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them, the court 
filing said. 
One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual 
relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's 
and well-known criminal defense attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations 
with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on 
private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the legal pleading 
added. 
Dershowitz called the allegations totally made up and totally fabricated from beginning to end. 
He said he was not in the places described in the filing at the relevant times, with one exception: 
he did visit Epstein's private island in the Caribbean on one occasion. 
I was there with my family, the renowned law professor said. 
Dershowitz said in a follow-up interview after this post first appeared Wednesday that he's 
planning to file bar complaints against Edwards and Cassell for inadequately vetting their client's 
story. 
I'm planning to file disbarment charges against the two lawyers who signed this petition without 
even checking the manifests of airplanes or travel itineraries, et cetera, he said. I'm also 
challenging the young woman and the lawyers to level those charges against me outside of the 
courtroom, so that I can sue them for defamation.....Finally, I'm challenging the woman to file 
criminal charges against me because the filing of false criminal charges is a crime. 
The motion accuses Prince Andrew of similar actions, asserting that Jane Doe #3 was forced to 
have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate geographical 
locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell's apartment), in New York, and on Epstein's private 
island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls). 
Previous press accounts have reported on Prince Andrew's friendship with Epstein, who was 
known as a philanthropist and supporter of scientific research before the criminal investigations 
began nearly a decade ago. However, the earlier accounts stopped short of accusing the prince of 
sexual involvement with girls Epstein procured. In a 2011 Vanity Fair story, Prince Andrew 
denied any such contact. 
While a Buckingham Palace spokesman did not respond to POLITICO's query about the matter 
on Wednesday, the palace issued a denial to several British news outlets Friday. This relates to 
long-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which The Duke of York is 
not a party. As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, 
any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue, the statement said. 
Prosecutors said in a 2007 draft letter they'd identified 40 young women who could be 
considered victims of Epstein's illegal acts. Many of them filed lawsuits or claims against 
Epstein and reached out-of-court settlements for amounts that were not disclosed.

While Jane Doe #3 is unidentified in this week's court filing, her story appears to track with 
that of a woman who sued Epstein in 2009 and settled with him later that year. She apparently 
granted an on-the-record interview to Britain's DailN Mail in 2011. 
Some of the fascination with Epstein on the part of tabloids and glossy magazines stems from his 
ties to former President Bill Clinton. In 2002, Epstein provided his 727 to Clinton for a trip to 
Africa to study anti-AIDS programs. Celebrities such as Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey came 
along for the ride. The new court filing makes no mention of Clinton, Tucker or Spacey. 
The federal investigation obtained manifests for Epstein's private jet travel, but prosecutors 
never charged anyone besides the investor with involvement in obtaining or using underaged 
girls for sexual purposes. 
The new court filing says this result is in part due to the fact that Epstein's legal team—which 
included such heavyweights as former independent counsel and solicitor general Ken Starr, trial 
lawyer Roy Black, and Dershowitz—negotiated a deal that precluded the feds charging anyone 
as a co-conspirator. 
Lawyers for Jane Doe #3 argue in the new motion that Dershowitz put this language in the 
agreement to protect himself. 
However, the law professor told POLITICO he didn't negotiate that deal and it wasn't aimed at 
protecting him. I had nothing to do with drafting the non-prosecution agreement, he said. 
Dershowitz added that the last draft of the agreement mentioned four people by name who 
wouldn't be prosecuted and he was not among them. All were regular associates or assistants of 
Epstein, the lawyer said, adding that the final language removed those names and simply barred 
federal prosecutors in South Florida from going after any potential co-conspirators. 
Epstein and his lawyers fought hard to prevent records about his plea negotiations from being 
turned over to victims' attorneys. However, U.S. District Court Judge Keith Marra ruled last year 
that the victims are entitled to examine those records to prepare their case against the 
government. 
Epstein, Black and others appealed that decision to the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of 
Appeals, but it ruled in April of this year that no privilege protects plea negotiations in this sort 
of dispute. 
Edwards and Cassell did not respond to requests for comment for this post, including an inquiry 
about their response to Dershowitz's comments. However, the pair appear to be pressing forward 
with the victims' rights lawsuit, which seeks to unravel the no-federal-prosecution deal cut for 
Epstein in 2007. 
UPDATE (Wednesday, 7:18 P.M.): This post has been updated with further comment from 
Dershowitz.
