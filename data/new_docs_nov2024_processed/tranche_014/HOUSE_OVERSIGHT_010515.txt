JAMES PATTERSON

originally, he said, “Let's go for it; this is an adult male in his
fifties who’s had sexual contact with children of the ages of
the victims.” He said this is somebody who we have to stop.
And whatever we need, he said, in the state attorney’s office,
we have a unit that’s equipped to investigate and prosecute
these kinds of cases. And I didn’t have too many facts early
on when I talked with him, but I knew that there were multi-
ple victims and to our detectives they were believable. So
when time went on and Mr. Epstein became aware of the
investigation and his lawyers contacted the state attorney's
office, they told me that.

And from that point on, and I believe it was Mr. Dershow-
itz initially, the tone and tenor of the discussions of this case
with Mr. Krischer changed completely. [At] one point he sug-
gested that we write [Epstein] a notice to appear, which
would be for a misdemeanor. He just completely changed
from not only our first conversation about this[ —when] he
didn’t know the name Jeffrey Epstein—till when he had
been informed on Mr. Epstein’s reputation and his wealth,
and I just thought that very unusual.

| feel like I know him or knew him very well, the state
attorney, and I just felt like he could not objectively make

decisions about this case: that is why I wrote it.
