enforcement agency to provide flight logs relevant to
this investigation.

And rather than providing all the flight logs
that were available at that time, he appears to have
provided flight logs that went from January 2005 through
September 2005, knowing that he appeared on an
October -- I may be off by one month here -- but on an
October 2005 flight log.

So that, to my mind, had indicated that
Professor Dershowitz was providing selective information
to law enforcement. Those concerns -- this is, you
know, there's -~ there's more to it.

The other problem was that the flight logs
that Mr. Dershowitz had produced were inconsistent with
the flight logs that Dave Rogers, one of Mr. Epstein's
pilots had, so there were now inconsistencies on these
flight logs. And it seemed to be -- it seemed to me to
be surprising that during the period of time where
Virginia Roberts was involved, Mr. Dershowitz was not
appearing on those flight logs.

Now, it is possible, I suppose, and that
seems to be Mr. Dershowitz's position, that the reason
he's not on those flight logs is that he was not on
those flights. But given all of the information -- and
I won't take your time this morning to go through -- all

the information I had about this international sex
trafficking organization, it seemed to me that it was
also possible that the sex trafficking organization,
which was represented by, you know, vast resources and
the ability to produce witnesses and documents and other
information that would -- would cover up the existence
of this organization, had gone through the flight logs
and had made necessary alterations to -~- to conceal the
scope of -- of the -- of the operation.

In addition to that, when I started to
compare the Dave Rogers' flight logs with the David --
excuse me. I am going to get a drink.

When I started to compare the -- oh, I'm
sorry. I should be looking at the camera.

When I started -- when I started to compare
the Dave Rogers’ flight logs with the Dershowitz --
which we call them the Dershowitz flight logs, which
were the logs that he had produced, there were
inconsistencies, and so it struck me as odd that there
were these inconsistent flight logs.

The other thing that I noticed is, I don't
believe that Dave Rogers was the exclusive pilot for
Mr. Epstein. And so I had a concern -- excuse me. I'm
sorry.

1 had a concern that the flight logs that --

that covered the jet were not just the David Rogers’
flight logs, but there should be flight logs for other
pilots which were not apparently being produced.

And so, in light of all that, what I was
seeing was a -~ a production of flight logs that was
incomplete. And then I started to hear from
Mr. Dershowitz that, well, these records prove
conclusively I couldn't have done that. And I knew to
an absolute certainty, that the records were
inconsistent and inaccurate; and for somebody who had
apparently carefully produced these records, to
represent that these conclusively prove that he wasn't
on the flights, seemed to me to be inaccurate
information.

So that was -- those were the kinds of things
I was thinking about.

Q. ‘Mr. Cassell, is it your testimony -~

MR, SIMPSON: Well, first of all, I move to

strike the nonresponsive portion of the answer.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Mr. Cassell, is it your testimony that you
have sufficient information to conclude and allege that
Professor Dershowitz falsified documents and gave
falsified documents to a prosecuting authority?

A. It is my belief that Professor Dershowitz

provided incomplete production to law enforcement
agencies.

Q. Is it your testimony under oath that you have
sufficient information to allege that Professor
Dershowitz intentionally provided false information to a
prosecuting authority?

A. It is my position that he provided incomplete
information to a prosecuting authority and inaccurate
information to a prosecuting authority.

Now, as to precisely what his state of mind
was when he was producing the incomplete and inaccurate
information, that remains to be this -- you know, that
was one of the topics that I was hoping could have been
covered in -- in the depositions here in the last two
days, but unfortunately, there wasn't sufficient time.

Q. Let me ask it a different way. You -- you
gave a long answer in which you described reasons you
apparently believe that these flight logs were not
merely incomplete, but that someone had false --
falsified them. And did I understand you correctly?

MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. The question that
was asked was limited to the time period prior to
December 30th. The answer that was given was
limited to the time period prior to December
30th.
