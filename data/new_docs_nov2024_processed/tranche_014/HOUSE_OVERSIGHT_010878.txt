And rather than say, hey, we don't have any
such documents, the U.S. Attorney's Office gave us the
response indicating, to our view, that there were such
documents, and as you know, since you're one of
Mr. Dershowitz's attorneys, we have drafted a pleading
now to try and collect that information, that law
enforce -~ federal law enforcement agencies have
collected, and -- and to figure out the appropriate way
to litigate that so that we can get that information and
move forward with the case.

That's just one example of -- of how the
allegations, if they were premature at that point, are
no longer going to be premature as the case moves along.

Q. Is it or is it not your understanding that
Judge Marra ruled that the allegations in this pleading
in front of you were so irrelevant to the pleading in
which they were stated, that they should be stricken
from the public record?

A. Inthat particular pleading at that
particular time, that’s right.

Q. Does that cause you to reassess, in any way,
having filed this document?

A. Well, I think certainly as a tactical matter,
we should have reserved the -- the allegations for --
for another motion. I -- 1 think that's -- you know,

certainly, with the -- you're -- now, we are now sort of
speculating, would we have done something different if
we knew that? And the answer to that is, sure, we would
have tried to do something that Judge Marra thought was
the appropriate way to handle it, so...

Q. And Judge Marra also reminded counsel of
their Rule 11 obligations; didn't he?

A, That's right. Yeah.

Q. And did it cause you to question, not
tactics, but whether you were acting properly in filing
this?

MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. I --

MR. SIMPSON: I'm just asking if it caused

him to reassess.

MR. SCAROLA: I understand what you're
asking, and you're asking him about his mental
processes in connection with pending litigation.
That's work product. I instruct you not to
answer that question.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. allright. You testified yesterday that one

reason that you found the filing of the complaint on
behalf of Jane Doe 102, who is Virginia Roberts, by
the -- Bob Josefsberg and -- and why that was
significant was that Bob Josefsberg had been selected by

the United States Attorney for the Southern District of
Florida to represent victims, correct?

A. Yes. Through the -- through the NPA, yeah,
there was an apparatus that led to his selection.

Q. And does that answer reflect holding the U.S.
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida in that
office in high regard?

A. Sure.

Q. Do you contend that at the time the United
States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida
negotiated the NPA, they knew that Professor Dershowitz,
himself, had been involved in abuse of minors?

A. Idon't know exactly what information they
had. I do know that we have been propounding discovery
requests on all of these subjects, including
Professor Dershowitz's involvement, when the U.S.
Attorney knew. They are asserting privilege over that.
I would wish they would waive the privilege or at least
provide the information to pro bono crime victims’
attorneys that they have, so we can get to the bottom of
this.

But there have been, you know, a nonstop
series of assertions of privilege and other barriers
interposed against us in this case, and I think
inappropriately so, and -- and we have been arguing that

now for a number of years.

Q. Would you agree with me that if the United
States Attorney's Office had been aware that Professor
Dershowitz had engaged in sexual misconduct with minors,
or himself had observed Mr. Epstein do so, that it would

have been improper and unethical for them to let Mr. --

Professor Dershowitz negotiate the terms of the NPA with
them?

A. If they had direct personal knowledge of
that, sure. I mean, the -- the -- but the realities are
a little bit more complicated in that Professor
Dershowitz, over the last couple of days as
frequently -- has frequently used the word continuum,
and so if they were certain of that, it absolutely would
have -- would have been unethical.

The question is: Well, what if they had a
suspicion or what if -- you know, a reasonable suspicion
or a possible suspicion. Those are the kinds of
dimensions that you've got to, you know, take into
account in the real world about, you know, what they --
what they would have done.

I mean, it seems pretty clear, for example,
that at some point, you know, later on, they got a black
book in which Professor Dershowitz's name had been
circled. Now, what they did with that information, I --
