adjustment revenue-neutral. That should help get both parties on board. We must
tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income. Dividend rates should revert
to the 4% - 6% range typical over the centuries before the pro-investment policies
put in place after World War II. We must do whatever we can to level the

consumption-investment playing field.

Obvious qualifiers are worth spelling out. (4.1) and all consequences are meant to
describe at the collective scale, where growth cannot be explained by transfer. Free
growth theory assumes depreciation investment, not zero investment. My charts
and tables will never be exact. There are inevitably errors and judgment biases in
the national accounts and research assembled by Piketty and Zucman, more added

by them, and more by me. These cautions will apply to later chapters as well.
