at the collective scale and where “ex post net” is again understood before “output.”

(5.1), but not (4.1), guarantees that terms are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.

Total growth means this ex post net investment (growth of physical capital) plus
growth of human capital. The latter would have puzzled us before the contribution

of Ben-Porath. Equation (4) in his 1967 paper, summarizing the first three, shows

human growth = invested consumption + self-invested work
— human depreciation, (5.2)

using my terms rather than his.

Chapter 6 will argue that this equation needs to be clarified. I gave a preview in
Chapter 2, and will update it now. Work is the output of human capital. Output is not
always positive. It is negative whenever growth and cash flow sum to less than zero.
A negative sum of these two shows unrecovered decapitalition (also called
deadweight loss). That would include unrecovered human depreciation. If (5.2)
meant all including negative self-invested work less all including unrecovered
human depreciation, it would subtract unrecovered human depreciation twice. Then

it must be corrected either to

human growth = invested consumption + positive self-invested work
— human depreciation, (5.3)

or equivalently

human growth = invested consumption + self-invested work
— recovered human depreciation. (5.3a)

It is clear that Ben-Porath meant (5.3), as other evidence shows that he treated

human depreciation as unrecovered. So does all tradition, mistakenly | believe, with
