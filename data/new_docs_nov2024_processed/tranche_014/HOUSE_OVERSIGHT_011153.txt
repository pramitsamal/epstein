Rae, Jevons and Boehm Bawerk all got nowhere because they modeled physical
capital only. Jevons, in particular, saw the productive cycle as the wage fund
reproducing itself as it was used up in consumption per (A11.1). He was close.
(A11.1a) models it as total capital reproducing itself as it is used up in pure
consumption. My next generation theory, really Petty’s, posits the generation length
as the deadline for transmitting all fitness (total capital) from each generation to the

next.

The generation length in R.A. Fisher’s sense is average age difference between both
parents and all offspring from first births to last weighted equally. It is a flexible
biological norm. It was probably well over 30 years before 1900 or so, when high
infant mortality compelled longer breeding to ensure that two would survive to
breed again. Contraception, known since Roman times, was then less practiced. It
seems to run a little under 30 years today in industrial countries. I model it at 28.5

years. That gives

T, =28.5 years and Cc, = —-=.035 /year . (A11.2)

(A9.5), inferred from free growth theory, already gives

I(K,),,optimum=Y optimum=c_, at the collective scale.

This shows that the output we actually control, meaning ex ante output, is optimized
at just enough to make up losses to pure consumption. Next generation theory

specifies that the loss and make-up period equals the generation length.
