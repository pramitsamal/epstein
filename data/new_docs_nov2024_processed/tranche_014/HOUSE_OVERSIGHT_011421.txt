There's a little bit more colloquy, and then Mr. Dershowitz

says: This is a long time ago. My recollection is that very

early on there was a joint defense agreement between several of

the people who were of interest to the district attorney and to

the federal government. That's my recollection. And I would
only want to resolve doubts in favor of privilege. Then

Mr. Dershowitz says: We can check further. I would be happy
to answer the question if it's not privileged. That's the

testimony that they say supports their assertion of this joint

defense agreement with Alan Dershowitz.

But there's more, your Honor. Mr. Edwards -- again,
who is a party in this deposition and not a lawyer -- chimes in

to the special master and Mr. Dershowitz: OQ. Ghislaine

Maxwell was never the target of the investigation, was she?

Confirming and arguing that Dershowitz is wrong about this

joint defense agreement at the time. And Dershowitz is

admitting that he doesn't really know and we should check and
we'll get back and people can ask these questions if I'm wrong

about this agreement.

They also take liberty with Ms. Maxwell's discussion

in her deposition about her knowledge about what happened to

Mr. Epstein and what he pled guilty to. When you look at those

pages of the transcript, you know, she says, I know he went to
jail, and then there's a back-and-forth between Ms. McCawley

and Ms. Maxwell about what did he go to jail for, and
