Dear Jean Luc,

Hope that you stay fine.

As per our conversation about placement of her with you in NYC and Miami, she said she found
some article in internet , which changed her position and she preferred to be placed with another
agency..

lam so sorry, but people believes in media more than in us sometimes, what is sad!

Warmest regards
