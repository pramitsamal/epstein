Attn: Scouting division MC2
We toak notes of your comments and the girls that you like on our website.

We know Jean Luc Brunel and we always work with him since more than 10 years all
those years and never had any problems.

All the girls he represented from us never had any problems. they were working have
great book work with good clients in editorial and campaigns and were well represented
models.

Now for all the new faces we have, we needed to talk to their parents to discuss about
me2 and you interest to represent their daughters and of course they gougle il and saw all
the bad articles about sex trafficking they were scared and | was myself speechless since
we know that it's not tue bul it was hard for us to explain to the parents.

So of course for the moment till all is claritied we can't place any new faces with you

because the parents will refuse and it makes us look had to propose the girls to your
agency.

We are sorry but you really need to clarify everything, till then we will have to cease any
collaboration and we will have to refuse lo lel you represent any of our models.
Sure you understand.
