Accountability & Reflection

As the Governor of the Bank

of England Mark Carney said

in 2015, the “crisis and its
aftermath laid bare that many

of our markets didn’t live up to
these standards” of transparency,
responsibility and accountability,
and warned that until markets
regain those qualities they cannot
retain their social license to
operate. |

The crisis also underscored the
lack of effective shareholder
scrutiny of boards of directors
and senior management on
essential corporate governance
issues such as risk management,
corporate strategy, independence
and long-term value creation.

To overcome these shortcomings,
the global investment community
took on the role of “active

stewardship’ in capital markets.
It started to adopt stewardship
codes to engage with companies
in seeking to improve business
practices and disclosures. These
efforts were focused on seeking
major reforms towards financial
stability and greater corporate
responsibility.

2010: Active Stewardship is Born

The concept of “active
stewardship’ was first introduced
in the United Kingdom in

2010 when the country’s
Financial Reporting Council
introduced the UK Stewardship
Code.” According to the code,
stewardship means that investors
are expected to proactively
engage with companies on issues
of strategy, performance, risk,
capital structure, and corporate
governance, including culture and
remuneration.

In January 2017, a group of U.S.
and international institutional
investors with combined assets
of $17 trillion followed suit

and launched the first U.S.
Stewardship Code.

The adoption of stewardship
codes in many national

markets highlights a new set of
responsibilities for shareholders.
By signing on, institutional
investors commit to closely
monitor their companies and

to use their voting power to
improve corporate behavior.

As fiduciaries, investors also
commit to be more transparent
about their own activities to their
clients and other stakeholders.

Today, active stewardship
includes many environmental,
social and governance (ESG)
issues that are priorities for those
investing with a sustainability
mindset. As fiduciaries, we

at Rockefeller & Co. seek to
engage with boards of directors
and senior management on

ESG issues to identify potential
long-term business risks and
encourage opportunities such as
management quality and ethics,
human capital and labor issues,
climate change and low carbon
economy. We believe that such
engagements can have a long-
lasting impact both on business
profitability and competitive
advantage.

Beyond the potential long-

term investment growth and
sustainability benefits of
implementing these engagement
activities, institutional investors
are leading the efforts to rebuild
trust in public markets after the
Financial crisis, starting where the
issues were most apparent — the
financial services sector.

Embracing Change: Financial Services Sector

Borne out of the trauma from
2008 and a new stricter reg-
ulatory environment, financial
services companies were the first
to face this new level of share-
holder scrutiny and engagement.

Wall Street came under pressure
by regulators and society to take
significant steps to change its
corporate governance guidelines,
business practices and culture.

3 ACTIVE STEWARDSHIP IN FINANCIAL SERVICES

It may come as a surprise to learn
that several large banks led the
reform efforts in 2010 by review-
ing their business standards and
ethics codes and implementing
