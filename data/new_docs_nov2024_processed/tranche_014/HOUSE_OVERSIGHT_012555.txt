really, want to talk to you about being a victim or --
A It wasn't always directly about being a

victim. And, every*time we talked, she would always i

so-on-and-so-forth, because I am a victim in this
case. 5

Q I assume, based on what you're telling me,
you continued to tell her, I'm not a victim?

A I just let her say what she said. I never
got counseling. But she knows from the beginning, and,
I continued to reassure her, that I don't feel that
way.

Q So, the first time you met with her, when you
spent about an hour with her and you went through all
your contact with Jeffrey, that's what occurred at that
meeting, and she talked to you about being a victim at
that meeting?

A Yes.

Q And then there was this second meeting, where
she brought a victim's rights person with her, and that
took place at Panera Bread, right?

A Yes.

Q And you had the same response, listen, you
think I'm a victim. You could give me the information,

but I don't need that information, right?
