Thank you, Jay. | have forwarded your message only io Alex, Andy, and Rolando. | don't
aniicipate it going any further than that. When | receive the originals, | will sign and return one
copy to you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will ba kept confidential since it also
contains identifying information about the girls.

When we reach an agreement about the altiorney representative for the girls, we can discuss
what | can tell him and the girls about the agreement. | know that Andy promised Chief Reiter
an update when a resolution was achieved. (Something | wouldn’t have promised in light of what
happened last year.) Rolando is calling, but Rolando knows not to tell Chief Reiter about the
money issue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and the amount of time that
has been agreed to. Rolanda also is telling Chief Reiter not to disclase the outcome to anyone.

Hi Jay — Sorry to be a bother, but do you have a copy that at least contains Mr. Epstein’s
signature? I need to pass it along to the powers that be. Thanks.
