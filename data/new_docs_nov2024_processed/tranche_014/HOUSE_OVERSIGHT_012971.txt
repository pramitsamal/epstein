3.6 Postscript: Formalizing Pattern 55

Using this definition of pattern, combined with the formal theory of intelligence given in
Chapter 7, one may formalize the various hypotheses made in the previous section, regarding
the emergence of different kinds of networks and structures as patterns in intelligent systems.
However, it appears quite difficult to prove the formal versions of these hypotheses given current
mathematical tools, which renders such formalizations of limited use.

Finally, consider the case where the metric space M has a partial ordering < on it; we may
then define

Definition 3.1. R € M is a subpattern in X € M to the degree

tren true(R < P)diX
dus

R
K —
* Jpem

This degree is called the subpattern intensity of P in X.

Roughly speaking, the subpattern intensity measures the percentage of patterns in X that
contain R (where containment is judged by the partial ordering <). But the percentage is
measured using a weighted average, where each pattern is weighted by its intensity as a pattern
in X. A subpattern may or may not be a pattern on its own. A nonpattern that happens to
occur within many patterns may be an intense subpattern.

Whether the subpatterns in X are to be considered part of the mind of X is a somewhat
superfluous question of semantics. Here we choose to extend the definition of mind given in
[Goe06a] to include subpatterns as well as patterns, because this makes it simpler to describe
the relationship between hypersets and minds, as we will do in Appendix ??.
