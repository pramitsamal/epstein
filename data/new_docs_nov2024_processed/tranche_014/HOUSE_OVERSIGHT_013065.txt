8.4 Some Critical Synergies 149

For instance, deduction might defer to the “attentional knowledge” subsystem, and make
a judgment as to which of the many possible next deductive steps are most associated with
the goal of inference and the inference steps taken so far, according to the HebbianLinks con-
structed by the attention allocation subsystem, based on observed associations. Or, if this fails,
deduction might ask MOSES (running in supervised categorization mode) to learn predicates
characterizing some of the terms involving the possible next inference steps. Once MOSES pro-
vides these new predicates, deduction can then attempt to incorporate these into its inference
process, hopefully (though not necessarily) arriving at a higher-confidence next step.

8.4 Some Critical Synergies

Referring back to Figure ??, and summarizing many of the ideas in the previous section, Table
?? enumerates a number of specific ways in which the cognitive processes mentioned in the
Figure may synergize with one another, potentially achieving dramatically greater efficiency
than would be possible on their own.

Of course, realizing these synergies on the practical algorithmic level requires significant
inventiveness and may be approached in many different ways. The specifics of how CogPrime
manifests these synergies are discussed in many following chapters.

cognitive processes explicitly used in CogPrime.
