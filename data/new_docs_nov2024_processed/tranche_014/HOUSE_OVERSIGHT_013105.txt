11.3 Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Stage

General Description

Cognitive Develop-
ment

Origin of Life

Automatic

System-environment
information exchange
controlled mainly by
struc-

innate system

tures or environment

Piagetan infantile

stage

Selforganizing proto-
life system, e.g. Oparin
[Opa52] water droplet,
or Cairns-Smith [CS90]
clay-based protolife

Adaptive

System-environment
info exchange heavily
guided by adaptively
internally-created
system structures

Piagetan “concrete op-
erational” stage: sys-
tematic internal world-
world-

model guides

exploration

Simple autopoietic sys-
tem, e.g. Oparin wa-
ter droplet w/ basic
metabolism

Symbolic

Internal symbolic rep-
resentation of informa-
tion exchange process

Piagetan formal stage:
explicit logical/experi-
mental learning about
how to cognize in var-
ious contexts

Genetic code: inter-

nal entities that “stand

for”

aspects of organ-
ism and environment,
thus enabling complex

epigenesis

Reflexive

Thoroughgoing self-
based

symbolic

modification
on this
representation

Piagetan post-formal
stage: purposive self-
modification of basic
mental processes

Genes+memes: genetic
code-patterns guide
their own modification
via influencing culture

and Origin of Life

Indeed, Piaget viewed developmental stages as emerging from general “algebraic” principles
rather than as being artifacts of the particulars of human psychology. But, Piaget’s stages are
probably best viewed as a general interpretive framework rather than a precise scientific theory.
Our suspicion is that once the empirical science of developmental psychology has progressed
further, it will become clearer how to fit the various data into a broad Piaget-like framework,
perhaps differing in many details from what Piaget described in his works.

Piaget conceived of child development in four stages, each roughly identified with an age
group, and corresponding closely to the system-theoretic stages mentioned above:

e infantile, corresponding to the automatic stage mentioned above

— Example: Grasping blocks, piling blocks on top of each other, copying words that are

heard

® preoperational and concrete operational, corresponding to the adaptive stage men-

tioned above

— Example: Building complex blocks structures, from imagination and from imitating
objects and pictures and based on verbal instructions; verbally describing what has
been constructed

e formal, corresponding to the symbolic stage mentioned above

— Example: Writing detailed instructions in words and diagrams, explaining how to con-
struct particular structures out of blocks; figuring out general rules describing which
sorts of blocks structures are likely to be most stable
