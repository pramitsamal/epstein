UU)

Jeffrey Epstein also filed a complaint with the Florida Bar against me. His complaint
alleged that I had been involved in Rothstein’s scheme and had thereby violated various
rules of professional responsibility. The Florida Bar investigated and dismissed the
complaint.

I have reviewed the Statement of Undisputed Facts filed contemporaneously with this
Affidavit. Each of the assertions concerning what I learned, what I did, and the good
faith beliefs formed by me in the course of my prosecutions of claims against Jeffrey
Epstein as contained in the Statement of Undisputed Facts is true, and the foundations
set out as support for my beliefs are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

All actions taken by me in the course of my prosecution of claims against Jeffrey
Epstein were based upon a good faith belief that they were reasonable, necessary, and

ethically proper to fulfill my obligation to zealously represent the interests of my
clients.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
