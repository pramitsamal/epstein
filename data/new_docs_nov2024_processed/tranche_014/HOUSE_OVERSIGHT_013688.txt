number spectra; (4) Non-Gaussian distributions with heavy tails and correlations
reflected in their Hurst, Fano, Allan and Levy exponents; (5) Statistical dynamical
descriptions of trajectories of the system in their embedding space such as
Lyapounov exponents, Hausdorff-Mandelbrot dimensions, Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen
measures, and Adler-Weiss-Ornstein topological and metric entropies.

Characteristics which discriminate between experimental versus control
conditions in parametric computational and real physiological and pharmacological
experiments serve to generate and test ideas and imagery arising out of behavior
observed in both biological and abstract dynamical realms. New experiments can
be suggested by the implicative structure of dynamical systems theory as well as
neurobiological findings and intuitions. As examples, the sudden “switch” of manic-
depressive bipolarity syndromes may be a “bifurcation” in nonlinear dynamical
systems; the “noise” of the statistical physicist may be the “arousal” of the brain
stem-thalamic biogenic amine and reticular formation neurophysiologist; aspects of
“thought disorder” in the pathophysiology of schizophrenic patients may be an
entropic sequencing idiosyncrasy in the “symbolic dynamics” of a particular brain
system attractor; neuronal “bursting” may be the “intermittency” of a neurodynamical
system; a multiplicity of “discrete ion channel conductances” may be a single “global
scaling hierarchy” of conductances times. The number of published examples of this
fusion of ideas and methodology in the biological-relevant literature is already in the
several hundreds and Medline counts indicate is growing exponentially.
Representative samples of these are described below.

In addition to the technological advances in computational hardware and
software, the major scientific surprise making this new era possible is the discovery
of universalities, the finite set of behaviors characteristic of most, if not all nonlinear
systems, across most if not all of the specific equations or neural systems being
explored. This makes the emergence of semi-quantitative equivalence relations
between model and data not only possible but likely, even though we don’t now and
perhaps never will know enough to either write or solve completely the specific and
detailed equations for the biological system of interest. We neuroscientists need not

be apologetic for using these ideas and tools qualitatively and empirically. In fact,
