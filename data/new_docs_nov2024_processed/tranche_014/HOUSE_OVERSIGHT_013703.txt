Styles of Orbital Motions in Chaotic Dynamical Systems

In chaotic dynamics, in various specific ways, an initial hypothetical handful
of points lined up along the trajectory and acted on over time by the nonlinear
differential equation (“operator”), get out of order in an unpredictable way. Here the
hypothetical handful can come from a statistical aggregate of initial conditions or
from a single recursive orbit studied over long times. As noted above, ergodic
theorists call this getting out of order “mixing” and how and to what degree this
happens consumes many mathematical theorems but for purposes of brain
research, it can be best described using a variety of statistical measures. For
example, visualizing the Lorenz attractor (see above) as a butterfly in phase space,
the points get out of order because as they spiral out (“stretching”) to the edge of
one wing and return (“folding”) to the unstable fixed point on the butterfly’s body
whence they either jump to some place on the other wing to spiral to its edge or
return to the same wing to spiral out again. Which one of these is chosen is
exquisitely sensitive to very small changes in where the trajectory started and very
small fluctuations in where it returned to the unstable fixed point on the butterfly’s
body. In fact, specification of these locations is beyond the precision of any real,

thermodynamically vulnerable system.
Chaotic trajectories on the Réssler attractor (see above) wind out (“stretch”)

to the edge along the inside of a conch shell in phase space and then are mapped
