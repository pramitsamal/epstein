Venky: We have a forgetful client who has us call him all the time with various reminders. One of our
clients on a custom plan has us wake him up every morning. We’ve done the legwork and found people
who fell out of contact after Katrina. Found jobs for clients! My favorite so far: One of our clients has a
pair of trousers that he really likes that aren’t in production anymore. He’s sending them to Bangalore
(from London) to have created exact replicas at a tiny fraction of the price.

Here are a few other YMII custom requests:

» Reminding an overzealous client to pay his current parking fines,
as well as not speed and collect parking fines.

e » Apologizing and sending flowers and cards to spouses of clients.

e » Charting a diet plan, reminding client on it regularly, ordering
groceries based on the specific diet plan.

e » Getting a job for a person who lost his job due to outsourcing a
year back. We did the job search, did the cover letters, did the
resume tuning, and got the client a job in 30 days.

e » Fixing a broken windowpane of a house in Geneva, Switzerland.

e » Collecting homework information from teacher’s voicemail and e-
mailing it to the client (parents of the kid).

e » Research on how to tie a shoelace meant for a kid (client’s son).
