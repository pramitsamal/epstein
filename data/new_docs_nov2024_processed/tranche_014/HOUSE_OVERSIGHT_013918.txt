This is what Doug of Pro Sound Effects used. As little as $40 a month with 1.5% per transaction.

From $15—500 per month, plus eBay fees.

Simple Payment Processing for Testing Pages, from Least to Most Involved

» PayPal Cart (www.paypal.com; see “merchant’’)

Accept credit card payments in minutes. No monthly fees, 1.9—2.9% of each transaction (called “discount
rate”) and $0.30 per transaction.

= Google Checkout ( http://checkout.google.com/sell _)

Get $10 in free processing for each $1 spent on AdWords; 2% and $0.20 per transaction thereafter.
Requires that customers have a Google ID, and is thus most useful as a supplement to one of the
aforementioned payment solutions. Be sure to link your Checkout account to your AdWords account to
receive credit. Important note: free transaction processing for nonprofits.

> Authorize.net ( www.authorize.net )

The Authorize.Net Payment Gateway can help you accept credit card and electronic check payments
quickly and affordably. More than 230,000 merchants trust Authorize.net to manage their transactions,
help prevent fraud, and grow their business. The fees per transaction are lower than PayPal or Google
Checkout, but setup will require a merchant account, covered in the next chapter, and other time-
consuming applications. I suggest setting up Authorize.net only after a product has tested successfully
through one of the other two options above.

Software for Understanding Web Traffic (Web Analytics)

How are people finding, browsing, and leaving your site?) How many prospective customers are being
delivered by each PPC ad, and which pages are most popular? These programs tell you all this and more.
Google is free for most low-volume sites—and better than a lot of paid software-and the others cost $30
and upward per month.

= Google Analytics ( www.google.com/analytics )

» CrazyEgg ( www.crazyegg.com )

I use CrazyEgg to see exactly where people are clicking most and least on homepages and landing pages.
It is particularly helpful for repositioning the most important links or buttons to help prompt visitors to
take specific next actions. Don’t guess what’s working or not— measure it.
