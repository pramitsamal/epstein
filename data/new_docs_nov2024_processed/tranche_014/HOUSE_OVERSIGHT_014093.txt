In the course of defaming Edwards and Cassell, Dershowitz also made numerous
representations that he had collected documents proving that he had never even met Jane Doe
No. 3, much less sexually abused her. For example, on the same CNN program on January 5,
Dershowitz stated: “No, never met her [Jane Doe No. 3], I didn’t know what she looked like until
I saw her photograph. . . . I have a superb memory. I have a memory of not having met her. J
did not meet her. And believe me, I remember everybody I’ve ever had sex with... . I can prove
it by flight records. I can prove it by my travel records.” Id. (emphasis added). Dershowitz
went on to say that disproving Jane Doe No. 3’s allegations was a simple task requiring about
one hour of work: “If they [Edwards and Cassell] had just done an hours’ worth of work, they
would have seen she is lying through her teeth.” Jd.

That same day, on NBC’s Today Show, Dershowitz repeated his claim that it was a
simple matter to collect documents disproving allegations made by Jane Doe No. 3:

Her lawyers Paul Cassell, a former Federal judge and Brad Edwards, deliberately

and willfully filed this pleading which they knew I had no opportunity to respond

to in court, without doing any investigation, if they had simply investigated the

manifests of the airplanes, if they had checked my travel records, if they had

asked me and I could have given the names of these people who are witnesses,
they would know the stories, totally, completely false.
