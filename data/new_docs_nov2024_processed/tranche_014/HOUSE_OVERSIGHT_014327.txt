greatest likelihood is for the loan loss reserve ratio is to stabilize near current
levels.

= Remains asset sensitive. Management acknowledged positive trends coming out
of a future Trump administration, with one being the positive benefit from higher
rates. With a December rate hike likely on the horizon, CFO Kent Lucien reminded
investors that a 25 bp rate increase would benefit NII marginally ($1.5mn on an
annual basis), but as the 10yr continues to rally, spread income will benefit more
significantly. A 100 bp increase contributes to a 5.2% increase in NII on an annual
basis.

= Continued focus on expenses. Management expects expenses to come in at the
upper end of their 3% to 3.5% guidance this year, mainly due to performance based
expenses such as stock based comp and commissions. A potential source of
expense savings should be reduction in the size of its branches, not necessarily
overall count. While management has piloted this new branch design it believes that
converting the entire branch network will be a multiyear process.

Capital deployment remains a priority. BOH continues to provide great
transparency in regards to their capital deployment strategy. Management
reiterated their commitment to payout 50% of net income in the form of dividends,
with a remaining portion going to buybacks. BOH has completed over $400mn in
buybacks over the past five years and noted that they are very comfortable with
this strategy, given its proven track record.
