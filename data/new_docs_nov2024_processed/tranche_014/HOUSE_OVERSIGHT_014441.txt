The question for investors is whether Trump the candidate or Trump the deal making

businessman will eventually be the driver behind trade policy. It is not impossible to

imagine the President-elect gaining some concessions from his hard line stance and

then claiming victory. After all, since one of his aims is to get the US economy growing

at 4% a year, a prosperous global economy to export into is probably preferable to one

that is taking a hit from an aggressive US trade policy. That is the inclination of our EM

strategists and economists, so they are expecting the reality to be softer than the
rhetoric.

At this stage we have to acknowledge that it is little more than an educated guess. It
makes us less certain of our long EM equity position than we were. Nevertheless, we
had already switched it out of an MSCI position into an Asia ex Japan in part because of
US election risks and our strategists are particularly upbeat about Asian markets. They
think they are cheap, they are positive on China and they think growth and hence
earnings will surprise on the upside.

What about the rest of the world? Growth has been improving

Growth indicators have been improving around the world of late. Data since the US
election would seem to support that with the PMIs in the Euro Area improving again and
their equivalent in the US sustaining the gains seen last month. Our EM indicators

remain robust and our China ACT indicator continues to indicate steady growth there
too.

Our economists forecast 3.5% global GDP growth with EM growth around 4.7%. Our
Euro Area growth numbers have been nudged back up towards 1 %% with Brexit not
proving to be as much of a drag as feared. We still expect the UK economy to see
something of a slowdown in 2017 as the lagged effect of the fall in the pound hits
consumer incomes. Perhaps our most optimistic view of the world, relative to
consensus, comes from Japan where with fiscal policy turning more supportive (we put
the package at 1.5% of GDP) we see growth at 1.4% in 2017.
