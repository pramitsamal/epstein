such regulation is “killing frontier innovation.”
Indeed, some have put forth the prevalence of
poor government policies as one of the theories to
explain the slow pace of this recovery.

Poor Policies in Washington

One of the theories that has been getting more
traction recently attributes the slower recovery

to poor policies enacted in Washington. In a June
2016 article about the US economy, Gregory
Mankiw, professor at Harvard University and
former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers
for President George W. Bush, highlighted “policy
missteps,” ** including misguided fiscal policy, as

a possible contributor to the slow pace of growth
since the global financial crisis.

One unusual feature of this recovery has, in
fact, been a contractionary fiscal policy. We have
derived an approximate historical measure of
fiscal policy changes by estimating changes in the
cyclically adjusted federal budget as a percentage
of GDP. We note that, by this measure, as far back
as 1890, fiscal policy has been expansionary in all
but three recoveries following a recession—with
the fiscal policy in the current recovery being the
most contractionary, as shown in Exhibit 16. In
this recovery, the budget deficit as a share of GDP
was reduced by 1.0% a year, compared to an
average widening of the budget deficit by 1.3% a
year in all other recoveries after severe recessions.
The average increase in the size of the budget

1970s highlight the conflicting perspectives on productivity.

* We define “severe” recessions according to those identified by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth
Rogoff in “Recovery from Financial Crises: Evidence from 100 Episodes” (2014), as well as the
1937 recession (a continuation of the 1929 recession) and the two most severe post-WWII
recessions (excluding the 2007 recession).

deficit for all recoveries, including less severe
ones, is -0.8%. A swing of 1.8 percentage points
would have had a material impact on the pace of
this recovery.

Professor Alan Blinder of Princeton University
and former vice chair at the Federal Reserve echoed
the sentiment by stating that partisan politics have
prevented progress in dealing with important
economic issues.** Shambaugh has outlined various
measures, such as infrastructure spending proposed
by President Obama in his fiscal year 2017 budget,
that would positively impact productivity and labor
force participation.’ The budget was not approved.
Summers has similarly called for expansionary fiscal
policy through infrastructure spending, but such
policies have not been pursued.**

Increased regulation has also been blamed
for some of the slow pace of this recovery. A
September 2016 working paper by Martin
Neil Baily and Nicholas Montalbano of the
Brookings Institution on the slow growth of US
productivity shows that while productivity in the
most productive firms is growing rapidly, their
best practices are not spreading to the rest of the
players in a given industry.*” Exhibit 17 shows the
widening gap between the productivity growth
rates of firms at the frontier of innovation and
