expansion in the US economy (see Section II,
United States). The state of the business cycle is a
key driver of market performance, evident in the
tight linkage between the S&P 500 and the ISM
Manufacturing Index (see Exhibit 51). Notably, the
S&P 500 has generated positive annual total returns
86% of the time during economic expansions in the
post-WWII period, while suffering annual declines
of greater than 10% just 4% of the time. During
the same postwar period, nearly three-fourths of the
bear markets—defined here as declines of 20% or
more—occurred during US recessions.

With few signs of an economic contraction
on the horizon, the high odds of positive returns
and low odds of large losses raise the hurdle
for underweighting equities significantly. This is
particularly true because the risks are not one-
sided: markets often surprise to the upside, too,
even at high valuations. Last year was a case in
point: the S&P 500’s 12% return matched our
good-case scenario, although at the start of 2016
we had attached only 20% odds to it occurring.

As we consider the potential for similar upside
surprises in 2017, earnings growth tops the list for
three reasons. First, we expect the sizable profit
drag from energy earnings to reverse in 2017,
with scope for a greater than $4-5 contribution
to S&P 500 EPS if recently announced global oil
production cuts are realized. Keep in mind that this
contribution was closer to $15 prior to the collapse

in oil prices. Second, a shift to a 25% corporate tax
rate could add $9-10 to S&P 500 EPS in 2017 if
enacted retroactively (see Exhibit 52). Finally, a tax
holiday for the estimated $1 trillion of cash held
overseas could lead to an additional $1-2 of EPS
upside from repatriation-driven buybacks.

There are also other, less visible potential
catalysts for equities. Over the last 20 years, the
total return of stocks has exceeded that of 10-year
Treasury bonds by only 2 percentage points, well
below the historical average of 4.4 percentage
points and a result that ranks in the bottom 20%
of all post-WWII observations. But after similar
periods of underperformance, stocks generated
well above average relative returns over the
next three and five years (see Exhibit 53). Said
differently, history suggests stock returns will
outpace those of bonds, even if expected equity
returns are uninspiring.

A related source of upside stems from the
lopsided investor flows evident in Exhibit 54. Here,
even moderate rebalancing out of bonds by retail
investors—who represent 80% of mutual fund
owners—would represent a sizable tailwind to
equities. Historically, a shift in flows from bonds
into equities has been motivated by three factors:
confidence in the durability of the economic
recovery, unattractive prospects for bond returns
and higher equity prices (see Exhibit 55). Our
central case features all three factors, suggesting the
