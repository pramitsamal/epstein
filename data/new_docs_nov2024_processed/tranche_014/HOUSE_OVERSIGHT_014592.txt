interplay of these inputs should still lead to positive
earnings growth of 6% in 2017.

The direction of valuation multiples is equally
important. As shown in Exhibit 68, Japanese
valuations are middling based on their history
since 1999, which we believe is the relevant
evaluation period given the deflationary headwinds
that emerged thereafter. For equity multiples
to move significantly higher from here would
require sustainable above-trend earnings growth
or a sizable increase in direct equity purchases
by the Japanese central bank. But with the BOJ
already holding a remarkable 60% of Japanese
ETF market assets!” and profit margins near
their peak levels, neither of these upside catalysts
seems probable. In fact, P/E multiples are forecast
to contract in our base case, as the 6% earnings
growth we expect will likely disappoint current
market expectations of 12%.

Putting these pieces together, we expect neither
a boom nor a bust for Japanese equities. Instead,
the combination of mid-single-digit earnings
growth, slight compression in valuation multiples
and a 1.9% dividend yield should generate a
5% total return. While this return is attractive
from an absolute standpoint, it also comes with
significant downside risks given the country’s
poor demographics, declining labor force and
high government debt load. Consequently, we are
tactically neutral on Japanese equities currently.

Emerging Market Equities: Finally in Gear,
but Potholes Ahead

Emerging market equities as a whole finally moved
forward in 2016 after three years in reverse:
multiples expanded, earnings estimates improved
and currencies appreciated, generating a 12%

total return. Politics and commodity prices were
key performance differentiators among emerging
markets last year, leading Brazil and Russia to the
winners’ podium while leaving Turkey and Mexico
in last place.

We expect emerging market equities to remain
on track in 2017. Our central case calls for
earnings growth of 5% in US dollar terms, driven
by faster nominal GDP growth and the lagged
impact of easier financial conditions and higher
commodity prices. But with multiples already at
post-crisis highs in an environment of rising global
rates and heightened risks, we see little scope for
further expansion. Combining these two inputs
with a dividend yield of 2.6%, our forecast implies
a total return of about 7% this year.

However, the uncertainty around this forecast
is quite large, as emerging market equities face
several potential potholes on the road ahead.
Chief among these is the ultimate policy agenda
of the incoming US administration. On the one
hand, a policy mix that favors US growth over
trade restrictions would support emerging market
exports and boost profits and equity returns.
