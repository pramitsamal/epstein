1Q investment thesis

We view SIVB as the best positioned bank in our coverage universe by a wide margin to
benefit from the combination of 1) rising interest rates — with SIVB ranking among the
most rate sensitive banks in the mid-cap banks group 2) stronger economic growth -
with SIVB's 2017 guidance (issued before the US elections) already calling for double
digit revenue growth 3) de-regulation 4) tax reform. Our '17e EPS of $9 and '18e EPS of
$12 imply YoY EPS growth of 24% and 33% respectively. SIVB trades at 18x our '17e
EPS and 2x YE17e TBV. Our PO of $190 implies P/'17e EPS of 20x (and 16x ‘18e EPS)
and P/YE17e TBV of 2.4x. This compares to an average P/E of 22.7x and P/TBV of 2.6x
that the stock traded at heading into and during the initial stages of the 2004-2006
interest rate cycle.

Deregulation/Gov’t Legislation: Among the one legislative action on the regulatory
front that appears likely to be passed under the new administration is the increase in
the $50bn SIFI asset threshold which brings with a heightened level of regulatory
scrutiny (such as undergoing the CCAR stress test). While we were not concerned about
SIVB's ability to transition into a CCAR bank, the removal of this should no doubt serve
as a positive. At $43bn in assets, becoming a CCAR bank had been weighing on investor
sentiment. With expectations for this threshold to be pushed higher, this should no
longer be a significant concern when thinking about SIVB's growth trajectory. Another
issue that has not been discussed much but could occur is any changes in the Volcker
rule that would allow the bank to once again participate in investing capital in PE/VC
funds. We view this restriction as an unintended consequence on SIVB stemming from
the Volcker rule and the ability once again participate in these funds would be a
significant positive given the potential for getting equity exposure in the early stages of
the life cycle of start-up companies.

Tax Policy: With SIVB paying an effective tax rate of 40.6% in 2016 YTD, the bank will
undoubtedly be a beneficiary from a lower corporate tax rate. While we believe it is too
soon to adjust estimates for this, we note that a 500bp reduction in the tax rate would
equate to 8.4% upside to SIVB's 2018 EPS estimate. Moreover, the potential for
hundreds of billion dollars in tax repatriation by the US tech giants also augurs well for
greasing the wheels for the start-up sector. While some of this repatriated capital will
no doubt go to buy backs and higher dividends, we expect some of this to flow into the
Start-up space as tech giants pursue M&A. At the very least it mitigates the risk of any
