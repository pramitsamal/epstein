Finally, in LatAm, we expect inflation to increase in Mexico, driving breakevens higher
across the curve. Although FX pass-through is very low in the country, the ongoing MXN
depreciation may add some pressure on inflation at the margin. In the case of Brazil, the
central bank was very successful in anchoring long-term inflation expectations driving
breakevens lower across the bond curve. For long-only investors, we believe linkers
should be more resilient versus nominal bonds.

While Brazil continues to have one of the highest nominal and real yields across the
globe, further compression requires stabilization in US yields. As long as the Brazilian
government is able to deliver on the reform front, approving a social security reform bill
next year, we see room for real yield compression from levels above 5.5% right now.

Inflation may not be back yet but deflation risk is most likely gone in most regions in our
view (the notable exception being the Eurozone, we believe, as discussed above). A year
ago we argued that the market deflation position was stretched and that there was
room for inflation surprises. Indeed, average inflation surprises in G1O economies have
been increasing since then and are now Clearly in positive territory (Chart 32). Monetary
policy in G10 economies is the loosest it has even been, suggesting that global inflation
could continue rising (Chart 33). This is not necessarily bad news, as the threat of
deflation is now gone. However, inflation rather than deflation trades are likely to
become an important driver in G10 FX.

We update a heatmap of inflation risks in G1O economies to determine how to position
for such risks in FX. We have discussed the methodology in Inflation and FX: What if the
dog starts barking?. The idea is to rank currencies based on a number of early warning
inflation indicators. Using equal weights, if most indicators point towards higher
inflation for a currency, we take this to suggest that investors should go long, against a
currency for which most indicators point towards deflation, both in relative terms.
