What if populism is too popular?
¢ G10: Short inflation/long duration through US 3-year 0% US inflation floors as
stimulus may falter. Short EUR/GBP as “sending the letter” may be the low point.

¢ EM: Short JPY/KRW, short BRL/MXN as US policies may hurt EM less than feared.
Long Turkey Eurobonds as sentiment may improve by the referendum in spring.

“Long populism” becoming consensus

While we received a lot of pushback for pointing out the risks ahead of the US elections,
now “long populism” is quickly becoming consensus. The naysayers may argue that the
establishment could reassert itself: conservatives may constrain fiscal stimulus and
protectionism, and central bankers may stay dovish (remember the ECB too). We
suggest five trade ideas: 1) short inflation/long duration; 2} short EUR/GBP; 3) short
JPY/KRW; 4) short BRL/MXN; and 5) long Turkey sovereign where populism may calm.

Populism is getting popular

5y5y US inflation swaps have spiked 60bp since summer to about 2.5% — the biggest
move since 2009. As a consequence, EM has sold off sharply. Our pre-election
sentiment surveys partly explain the violence of the moves since 8 November: investors
were long EM bonds and equities and neutral duration in the US (Chart 40). The latest
CFTC data show a similar picture, with short GBP and long BRL, Crude, RUB and even
MXN most extreme vs history; note also a short in US Treasuries. Purely statistically
speaking, the shorts in GBP and US Treasuries are most vulnerable to a near-term
reversal — though momentum may prevail for a while in Treasuries (Chart 41). When the
dust settles, the contrarian may find opportunities in “short populism” trades.
