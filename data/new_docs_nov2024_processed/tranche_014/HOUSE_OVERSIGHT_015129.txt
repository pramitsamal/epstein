The paradox of our nation is that we turn our vices into virtues. As
the truth about political assassinations—from Malcolm X to Mrs. Dorothy
Hunt—finally begins to emerge, we may truthfully say, “Only in America
does there exist the freedom to reveal how insidious we have been, and
then to continue in our insidious way with an even more determined
spirit.”

| still believe that the United States is the greatest country in the
world. It is also the greatest show on earth.

| once had a vision of myself leaving Washington the way Jimmy
Durante used to end his TV program, standing in a spotlight and bowing
gracefully to the audience, then walking back a few steps into another
spotlight, bowing again, and so on. Instead, | ended up sounding as
helpless as Hal the Computer in the movie 2007, unable to control my own
memory banks.

My consolation for this personal tragedy is summed up in Jeane
Dixon’ s prediction: “Historians yet unborn are going to take the facts,
and Richard Nixon will go down as a great President. They’ re going to
find that the price the world is paying for trying to discredit Nixon is going

to be that we’ Il practically lose our freedom.”
