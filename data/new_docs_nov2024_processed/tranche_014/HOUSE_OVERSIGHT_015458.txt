population to counteract the essence of evil with love, laughs, and law,
fueled by the aid of true news. Incidentally, Putin had 88 journalists
murdered. No wonder Trump told him, “It’ s an honor to be with you.”
Now Putin wanted Obama’ s new sanctions on Russia to be reprieved.

National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had discussed it with the
Russian ambassador a month before Trump took office. Although General
Flynn joined his campaign and shared criminal secrets, he denied them to
the FBI. It was a felony offense. The Justice Department warned Trump that
Flynn had misled Mike Pence, and that Flynn could be vulnerable to
blackmail. Trump asked Flynn to resign, and yet he offered his job back
when he got out of prison. Why? Because Flynn was the scapegoat, taking
the fall for the president and vice-president. He preferred a trial with
immunity since they knew all. Pence said Flynn lied and that was a lie.

If Trump and Pence were both to be kicked out of the White House,
the next in line would be the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Steve
Bannon described him as_ “a limp-dick motherfucker who was born in a
petri dish at the Heritage Foundation.” In turn, Trunp’ s communicator
Anthony Scaramucci boasted, “I’ m not Steve Bannon, |’ m not trying to
suck my own cock.” Ah, but Bannon said he wanted to destroy Ryan.

Hallelujah!
