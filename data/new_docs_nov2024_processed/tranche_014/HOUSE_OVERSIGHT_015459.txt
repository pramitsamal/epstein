Trump once tried to patent “You’ re fired.” Professional hater
Bannon resigned. Back to running his Breitbart News. He had taken over
the original right-wing website, Breitbart.com, after the death of editor
Andrew Breitbart, who ironically was adopted and raised as a proud Jew.

Orson Bean is my oldest living friend. He became a Christian
libertarian conservative, and we’ve had an ongoing email dialogue about
religion, but he’s still a Christian and I’m still an atheist. Not a militant
atheist, as I used to be, though. I changed when I realized that Martin Luther
King was a Christian, yet I was inspired by his actions, and George Lincoln
Rockwell, head of the American Nazi Party, was an agnostic, yet I abhorred
what he stood for. It no longer mattered to me what anybody’s religious belief
was, only how they treated others. Either kind or cruel. That simple.

I decided to email Orson: “If you can arrange for me to interview
Andrew Breitbart’--his son-in-law--“Ill believe in God.” Orson must’ve
forwarded my email to Breitbart, because He sent me an email saying,
“Apparently there is a God,” with his own phone number. I called, we spoke,
and he agreed to do an interview. My only ground rule would be that neither
of us would interrupt the other. I contacted Steve Randall, my editor at
Playboy, and I got the assignment. I immediately sent an email to Orson with

the good news. The Subject line was “Praise the fucking Lord.”” Amen.
