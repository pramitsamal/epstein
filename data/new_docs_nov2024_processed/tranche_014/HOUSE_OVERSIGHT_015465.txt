Astronomy & Space Travel

How would we travel nearly five light years? This article explores different engineering solutions
to the puzzle of taking a very, very, long trip, intertwiming science-fiction goals with real world
solutions. Students will explore fanciful applications of Newton’s second law, and concepts of
momentum, ions, and nuclear fusion.

Lesson Plan

Review vocabulary words in class. Have students read the article and answer the reading comprehension ques-
tions for homework, as well as generate a discussion question of their own. In class, address any conceptual
questions that the class might have. Have students write discussion questions on the board, along with the ones
suggested in this document. Have students break up into small groups, each of which should address one of the
discussion questions. 15 MIN

Dedicate the remaining class time to completing one of the activities. 30-45 MIN
