Impossible Shape

That is Turing’s argument in a nutshell. But if that was too large a
step, let’s take the argument a little more slowly and prove it a couple of
different ways. First, we will use a proof by counterexample, known by
mathematicians as an ‘indirect proof: These may tax your brain. If you
want a visual image to help with the idea of an indirect proof, take a look
at the impossible shape. It is paradoxical, which means it does not exist.
QED.

The Proofs

There are several ways to prove the non-existence of the Halting Program.
I am going to present a few in the hope one of them will hit the mark and
allow you to see why. The first proof uses a software flowchart. I have
laid this out on the assumption the program exists and then attempted
to apply it to itself. Unfortunately, the flowchart contains a paradox
and thus there can be no Halting Program. The paradox is at once
straightforward and confusing. It is a more elaborate version of the liar’s
paradox: “This sentence is a lie” If the sentence is true it must be false,
and if the sentence is false then it must be true.

The Halting Program

Let us suppose there is a Halting Program. Remember that a Halting
Program simply takes another program as input and predicts if it will
halt or not. It follows there must also be a program called Haltcrash.
Haltcrash goes into an infinite loop if it examines a program with input
that halts, otherwise it halts itself.
