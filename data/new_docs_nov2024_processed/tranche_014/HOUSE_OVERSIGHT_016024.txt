334 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

This is quite a complex piece of mathematics so let me show you how
it works. Again, our thought experiment relies on an analogy involving
clothing — sorry.

In the Bell Test experiment three polarizers are set up at 0, % and %
of the way around a circle, 120 degrees apart. For Einstein to be correct
photons must each carry at least three pieces of information:

If I meet the 0 degree polarizer do I go through or not?
If I meet the 120 degree polarizer do I go through or not?
If I meet the 240 degree polarizer do I go through or not?

If a photon had only one piece of information, say that it was
vertically polarized, it would not know what to do if it came across a
polarizer at 45 degrees. In that case the photon would sometimes go
through and sometimes not, with a fifty-fifty probability. But Einstein
did not want to countenance probability. “God does not play dice with
the Universe.” He required certainty. “I like to think the Moon is there
when I am not watching it” The photons must know enough to handle,
with certainty, any eventuality they may come across. (We could set up
experiments with a more complex set of choices, dividing the photons

into quarters, fifths and so on, but thirds are simple numbers and we can
use the children’s clothing analogy to demonstrate the mathematics.)
