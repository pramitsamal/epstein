340 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

the question “Where did the laws of physics come from?” If you don't
believe in a god then pushing a creator figure further and further up the
chain eventually makes him redundant. If you have faith, you can take
the position God is the creator of the fundamental rules.

Regardless of your personal position, I would like to make the
argument for free will independent of belief. We must resolve the age-
old paradox: How can God be all-knowing and all-powerful, and still
have free will?

This is a long-standing theological debate dating back to the 15
century. It splits theologians into two camps. The first maintains God has
both omniscience and omnipotence, and they are not inconsistent. This
is the compatibilism argument again. Despite the acknowledged paradox,
they argue that we should simply accept it and acknowledge that we are
unable to comprehend such things. I don’t like this argument because
it essentially denies reason. We are supposed to acknowledge that we
simply cannot understand the mind of God. I prefer the more modern
argument from the second camp that omnipotence trumps omniscience.
It preserves the view that man can reason about the Universe - “Man is
made in God’s image.”

This argument follows the logic: God must be able to choose not to
know what will happen in the future so that he can have free will.
