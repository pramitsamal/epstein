useful and relevant pricing benchmark in this regard, in our view. The Qatar 10-year
sovereign bond currently trades at yields of 3.0%. However, Saudi CDS has been trading
c65bps wider of Qatari CDS, which would suggest a 10-year Saudi bond yield of c3.65%.
Current CDS spread levels suggest potential for some notch downgrades from Saudi
Arabia’s current rating, as the market prices in issuance risk, volatile oil prices, hedging

flows relative to the USD peg and the banking sector off-balance sheet wrong-way
exposure risk.

Saudi forwards, rates and CDS remain under pressure

Domestic rates are under pressure with the 5y IRS spread over US at historically
elevated levels due to structurally tighter liquidity. Budget consolidation could help take
some of the pressure off as it would imply lower debt issuance needs. However, it would
also imply lower deposit formation in domestic banks as fiscal retrenchment will impact
private sector economic activity. Greater risk premium, issuance pressures and tighter
liquidity will also keep CDS spreads elevated until oil recovers.

Hedging against SAR devaluation risks remains strategically attractive given the risk-
reward ratio. Data suggest a strained backdrop for external and domestic liquidity
reflecting the combination of private sector dollarization, possible capital outflows,
weakening deposit formation and the move higher in interbank rates. However, SAMA
has already intervened through macro-prudential tools and may do so again if needed.
