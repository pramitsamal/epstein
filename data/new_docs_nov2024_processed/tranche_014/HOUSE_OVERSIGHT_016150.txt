Table 13: Summary of key sectors likely benefiting from and impacted by the National Transformation Program

Sectors likely benefiting from NTP Rationale

Petrochemicals With US$ 11bn being allocated to project development, downstream chemicals second largest focus of NTP; significant increase
in natural gas availability (indigenous and imported); expansion opportunities

Healthcare Volume growth opportunities for private healthcare providers (management contracts); private health insurance growing;
participation in privatisations; significant increase in local pharmaceutical production

Insurance (healthcare) Private insurance coverage to increase to 31mn from 10.5mn currently; rising availability of private healthcare facilities

Real estate Higher home ownership targeted; improved access to financing/housing subsidies to both developers and buyers; volumes set to
expand as NTP targets higher real estate sector growth; increased opportunities for private sector investment

Consumer staples Demand growth from religious tourists; formalisation and Saudisation of retail sector; growth in locally produced poultry sales;
longer-term private sector job creation

Telecom Government spending US$2bn to enhance FTTH and Mobile networks; focus on increasing internet usage; religious tourism will
boost demand

Metals and mining Provision of new mining licenses; potential investment opportunities for international mining companies

Defence Increased localization will cut imports, develop local industrial capabilities and create jobs

Sectors likely negatively impacted by NTP _ Rationale

Consumer discretionary Near-term squeeze on consumer disposable income and sentiment; increased competition as foreign entities given 100%
ownership entitlement; development of Saudi postal system possibly a precursor to online shopping increase

Petrochemicals Potential reduction in feedstock subsidies; potential for increased competition from international companies

Real estate Land tax on white land could impact cost base and prices in urban areas; higher competition from new entrants

All sectors Rising costs on reduced subsidies (particularly water and energy); higher wage costs; increased financing burden on private

Six key investible themes from the NTP are emerging
Using this frame work we believe a number of investible themes are emerging including:

1. Ambitious plans to grow religious tourism: with Hajj visitors set to increase
from 1.5mn to 2.5mn and Foreign Umrah Pilgrims from 6mn to 15mn per
annum, we see significant potential for the travel & tourism, transport sectors,
consumer discretionary and telecom services sectors to benefit.

2. Down trading as pressure mounts on the consumer: With the NTP looking
to reduce subsidies on energy (including transport fuels) and water, we see
pressure on the disposable income of Saudi consumers rising in the short- to
medium-term (although in the longer term, we expect higher employment
levels, growing home ownership and accelerating growth to offset these
factors). These issues could be further augmented by a slowdown in public
sector wage growth and growth in the proportion of residents employed by the
private sector,

In reflection, we believe that the consumer will likely become more value
conscious in the near- to medium-term as stress on consumer discretionary
spend mounts. As such, we continue to prefer the consumer staples and the
grocery retailers in this environment. We also believe the grocery retailers will
benefit from the government’s focus on formalising the sector (it is highly
fragmented currently and dominated by smaller independent stores) in an
effort to increase Saudi participation. That said, we believe consumer
discretionary companies which offer more affordable and economic goods
could benefit as they take market share.

3. Rising focus on healthcare provision: Saudi Arabia is focused on significantly
growing accessibility to healthcare for its residents. The provisions in the NTP
include a significant increase in medical centres (hospitals and clinics), wider
provision of private health insurance and an increase in the level of
