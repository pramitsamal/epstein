Price objective basis & risk

Al Hammadi (XBQYF)

Our SAR64 PO for Al Hammadi is based on our DCF-derived valuation. This is equivalent
to 32x FY17E EPS. Strong earnings growth means out-year valuations appear much
more reasonable than near-term valuations (e.g. implied 13x FY20E EPS). Company
specific risks are: lower-than-expected growth resulting from delays in executing on
expansion plans, inability to raise prices to offset cost inflation, failure to manage
growth without impacting margins, pricing pressure from insurers, new competition,
sustained delays to government payments, and any potentially dilutive acquisitions.
General/macro risks are: sustained low oil prices and any resultant slow-down in the
economy, civil unrest, ongoing failure of the government to pay bills.

Al Othaim (XWPJF)

We use a combination of DCF, DDM and peer group analysis to value Al Othaim. We
have taken a weighted average of values implied by our DCF, DDM and peer group
analyses. We attribute a 50% weight to the DCF and 25% weights for both the DDM and
the P/E multiple, which points to a PO of SAR121. We attribute a greater weight to the
DCF valuation as we believe food retailers offer good visibility on cash flow generation.
In the case of Al Othaim, we think DCF better reflects the stock's growth opportunity.
We assume a perpetuity growth rate of 2% and WACC of 9.1% in our DCF.

The downside risks to our investment case are:

- Weaker-than-expected margin performance

- Cannibalisation effect in Saudi Arabia

- Competition: We expect competition to intensify among the large organized players,
such as Savola-owned Panda which have aggressive retail expansion plans growth plan
- Saudization: Most of Al Othaim’'s labors are low level staff working in the warehouses
and branches which depends heavily on expatriate labors. This suggests the Saudization
of the staff could put further pressure on margins.

Almarai (XALRF)
We arrive at our SAR61/share price objective using a combination of P/E multiples and
DCF valuation, taking the average yielded by the two methods. More specifically:
