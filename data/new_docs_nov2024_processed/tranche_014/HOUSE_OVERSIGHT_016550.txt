Orders and the Autonomy Rights of Victims, 40 B.C. LE. Rev. 937, 942-43 (1999) (arguing that prosecutors' view of domestic violence as a
private problem contributed to reluctance to prosecute). On drunk-driving law and policy, see Gershowitz, supra note 219 (describing efforts

1975) (The judge's independent review of the complaint checks and balances the district attorney's decision and further hedges against
possibility of error.).

238 Outside the United States, prosecution agencies are commonly under a politically accountable justice minister or attorney general, whose
political judgment, in principle, operates only at the level of broad policy and should not interfere with specific case decisions. See, e.g.,
Prosecution of Offences Act 1974, § 2(5) (Act No. 22/1974) (Ir.) http:/
/www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1974/act/22/section/2/enacted/en/index.html (The Director [of Public Prosecutions] shall be independent in the
performance of his functions.). Australia's Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, whose director is appointed for a
seven-year term, is an independent prosecution service within the Commonwealth Attorney-General's portfolio, but functions independently
of the Attorney-General and the political process. Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth) (Austl.) (as amended 2012); About Us,
