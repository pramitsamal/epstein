Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08

Mr. Gerry said zoning is tied into business tax receipts because zoning
requirements do not allow certain businesses in some districts. There is also the
question of whether the space is legitimate because people will subdivide suites
and make two spaces where there should only be one. Mr. Gerry said it looked
like a legal space from the documentation Mr. Clark provided but the Zoning
Administrator needed to approve it.

MOTION BY MR. FRIED TO POSTPONE THE CASE UNTIL THE
AUGUST 21, 2008 HEARING DATE

SECONDED BY MS. VAN BUREN

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

H. Case # 08-2517, 2270 E. Ibis Isle Road, Mark Remson Trust
REPEAT Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86 of the Town of Palm Beach
Code of Ordinances, Environment, properties to be maintained in a good
condition.

Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said the
violation was discovered from routine patrol in the area but shortly after the notice
of repeat violation was sent out, a citizen complaint was received as well. Mr.
Weymer said there had been at least seven previous letters to this property owner
regarding lack of maintenance on the property. A repeat notice of code violation
was mailed out on June 24, 2008 with a mandatory hearing date. The lot was cut
on or around July 2, 2008. This particular violation is a Class I violation under
the fine schedule which calls for a fine of $400.00, however, by law, the Board has
the ability to impose a fine of up to $500.00 because it is a repeat violation. Mr.
Weymer said he believes it is important to look at the track record of this property
in considering the fine. The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance,
administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and a fine of $500.00, which is the
maximum fine for a repeat violation.

Mr. Hoffman said it seemed that every time the property owner gets notified he
comes into compliance but he has to be notified. Mr. Weymer says there are times
when he comes into compliance but on at least two other occasions, he has been
before the Board because he has not complied by the time set. Mr. Ochstein asked
if he has been fined in the past and Mr. Weymer said there are two outstanding
fines for which liens have been placed on the property.

MOTION BY MS. GREENBERG TO FIND THE VIOLATOR IN NON-
COMPLIANCE, ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE AMOUNT
OF $150.00 AND A FINE OF $500.00
