COMPLIANCE WAS NOT ACHIEVED

SECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

VIII. Fine Reduction:

A. Case # 08-2301, 167 E. Inlet Drive, The Landfall Group,
Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-242, Subsection 104.5.1.6, medium projects,
all new or remodel construction projects 4000 sq. ft, to 8,999 sq. ft. under roof be
allowed 22 months

Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said in October, 2007, Ajax Equity LLC
was found in violation of going over the construction time limits. On November
15, 2008 they still were not in compliance and a daily fine of $250.00 started
running. The final inspection was obtained in March, 2008. The fine ran for 137
days prior to compliance being achieved and the accumulated fine due is
$34,250.00 and the $150.00 hearing costs have not been paid.

Frank Lynch advised he was the attorney for both The Landfall Group and Ajax.

He said when they appeared before the Board in October, Lazslo Wagner, the
principal of The Landfall Group, who has built homes throughout the Town of
Palm Beach for 26 years acknowledged he was unaware of this particular code
provision. Had he been, they would have applied for an extension of time to
complete the construction. At the hearing, Mr. Koeppel made a motion to allow
them an additional sixty (60) days to complete the construction, find them in non-
compliance and assess the $150 costs. After a significant amount of discussion,
that motion went to a vote and failed 4-3. A second motion was made and Ms.
Duemler thought the $250.00 fee was significant and believed the fine should be
$125.00 a day. Mr. Lynch gave Mr. Walton a copy of that transcript to put in the
record. As part of their request, they are asking the Board to consider what Ms.
Duemler suggested at the meeting. At the same time, Mr. Lynch said he would like
them to consider that The Landfall Group is a good corporate citizen and made a
legitimate mistake. As a result, a fine was incurred and they are willing to accept
some level of fine, some level of responsibility for what they did. The construction
was continually on going, there were no delays other than the construction process
itself. This was not someone’s house, it was a speculative venture. There had
been some concerns with the shell contractor and the finish items themselves were
significant enough that there were substantial delays. At that same hearing, Code
Enforcement Officer Gerry said it was the position of Code Enforcement to get
more assertive at the suggestion of Town Council and that these projects were to
be more aggressively pursued. Under the new ordinance, for a house of
approximately 5,000 sq. feet, they would be entitled to 24 months. This would
