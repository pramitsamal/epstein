Jumping a mugger

When I was a young lawyer, I frequently took my kids to Boston Bruin hockey games, which
were rough and tumble affairs, both on the ice and in the stands. At one game, a great lawyer
with whom I have sometimes worked, Joe Oteri was sitting a row in front of me with his teenage
daughter. During a break between period, Joe went out for a beer. An older teenage guy began
to aggressively flirt with Joe’s daughter. When Joe saw him touching his daughter in an
unwelcome way, he grabbed him. Unbeknownst to Joe, the guy’s friend was standing in back of
him and raised his hand above his head about to hit Joe from behind. As soon as I saw this, I
leaped over the seats and grabbed the guy from behind, preventing him from hitting Joe. The
security came and quickly separated us. When Joe began to tell this story to anyone who would
listen, it kept getting better and better. The final version had me beating up the two maulers and
saving his daughter’s life. Although the reality is that my heroism was quite limited and totally
instinctive, Joe has never forgotten what I did and has always shown his appreciation.
