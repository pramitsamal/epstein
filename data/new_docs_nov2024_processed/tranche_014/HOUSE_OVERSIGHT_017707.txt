2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *962

It is important to emphasize one argument the Advisory Committee does not appear to make: that the CVRA applies only to
charged crimes. Any such argument would not only fly squarely in the face of the CVRA's venue and coverage provisions
applying victims' rights against investigating agencies, but also of the CVRA's clear legislative history. Discussing the CVRA's
definition of a crime victim, *°? Senator Kyl said the statute used an intentionally broad definition because all victims of
crime deserve to have their rights protected, whether or not they are the victim of the count charged. *°°

At least one federal magistrate judge has suggested, in dicta, that - in spite of Senator Kyl's plain statement - the CVRA might
not apply until charges have been filed. *°! His primary reason for doing so, however, was that the Supreme Court's decision in
Hughey v. United States, ©? suggested this result. To be sure, the victims statute at issue in Hughey (the Victim Witness
Protection Act) did employ a similar definition of victim as that found in the CVRA. But Hughey turned on the fact that other
language in the restitution statute provided that a defendant convicted of an offense’ may be ordered to make restitution to
any victim of such offense. > Such a straightforward holding says little about a statute - such as the fairness provision in
the CVRA - that contains no such limiting language regarding persons convicted ... of [an] offense. Moreover, the magistrate
judge did not discuss the CVRA's coverage and venue provisions, which plainly dictate that the CVRA applies to crimes not yet
charged. For all these reasons, the [*963] Advisory Committee should apply the CVRA as written and include a venue
provision both for prosecuted and not-yet-prosecuted crimes.

Fifth, and most important, in proposed Rule 60(b)(2), the Advisory Committee gives victims the power to assert rights under
these rules. As has been noted throughout this Article, the Rules as they would be amended by the Advisory Committee leave
out many of the victims' rights under the CVRA. For example, the victims right to a speedy trial has not been included in the
proposed rule changes. >°* By giving victims the power to only assert the limited number of rights listed under these rules,
the Advisory Committee ignores many victims’ rights under the CVRA. At the very least, the language should be changed to
make clear that victims to assert all rights that they have under the CVRA.

One change that the Advisory Committee should not make is worth brief mention: The Advisory Committee should not add a
provision for a fact-finding hearing to determine whether someone is a victim of crime. In its comment on the pending
proposed amendments, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) has proposed such a procedure.
The rationale it gives is that the conferring of rights' on the victim’ comes, in general, at the expense of the defendant. Thus,
due process requires that a provision be added to these Rules for a factfinding hearing, to be held whenever the proper labeling
of a person as victim,’ is in dispute ... . °°

The NACDL's rationale is patently defective. The rights in the CVRA do not interfere with any rights of the defendant, as
pointed out throughout this Article. *©° For instance, for victims to be notified of court hearings, to attend those hearings, and

566 While the CVRA extends to uncharged crimes, it is also obvious that the CVRA does not grant victims any rights against individuals who
have not been convicted of a crime. Jn re W.R. Huff Asset Mgmt. Co., 409 F.3d 555, 564 (2d Cir. 2005) (emphasis added); accord Searcy v.

the CVRA extends rights against the government - that is, rights not to be victimized again through the process by which government
