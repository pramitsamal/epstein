C. The Last Word? Legislation to Fully Implement the CVRA

Unsatisfied with the timid approach taken by the Advisory Committee on the CVRA, Senator Jon Kyl introduced legislation to
comprehensively amend the federal rules on June 29, 2007. Senator Kyl explained that the Advisory Committee's amendments
do little more than reiterate limited parts of the statute. °° Agreeing with the major premise of this Article - that crime
victims must be treated fairly in the criminal justice process - Senator Kyl noted: Of particular importance, the CVRA
guaranteed that crime victims would have the right to be treated with fairness.' My proposed amendments would add to the
Federal rules the changes needed to treat crime victims fairly. ®°! Senator Kyl was also concerned about delay by the
Advisory Committee in moving forward with comprehensive amendments:

Congress enacted the CVRA in October 2004. In the almost 3 years since then, I have waited patiently to give the federal courts
the first opportunity to review the need for rule changes. At the same time, though, I have made clear my position, as one of the
cosponsors of the CVRA, that Congress expected significant reforms in the Federal rules. As I explained to my colleagues at
that time, the crime victims’ [*970] community in this country was looking to the CVRA to serve as a model for the states and
a formula to fully protect crime victims. °°?

Accordingly, Senator Kyl proposed a long string of direct amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to
comprehensively protect victims’ rights.

Some of the legislation that Senator Kyl proposed tracked my proposals in this Article. For example, he proposed amendments
to a number of rules - including Rules 2, 10.1, © 11(b)(4), 11(c)(1), 11(c)(2), 12.1, 12.3, 15, 21(e), 32(f)(1), 32(h), 43.1, 44,
46, and 50(c) - largely tracking my proposals.

But other proposed changes went well beyond those I propose here. For example, Senator Kyl proposed changing Rule 4's
provision dealing with execution of arrest warrants to require reasonable efforts to give notice to victims about the initial

appearance of an arrested suspect. ©°4 Along the same lines, Senator Kyl would give victims reasonable notice of any decision

605

to release a defendant at the initial appearance as well as notice of any pretrial conference. °° He also would give federal

prosecutors authority to release to a victim any discovery materials that have been released to the defendant. °°” To assist non-
English speaking crime victims, he proposes to give the courts authority to appoint an interpreter for the victim. °% Senator
Kyl's bill would also require disclosure to the victim of any presentence report except any portion of such report excised by

the court for compelling reasons or made confidential by law. ©? And his bill would require that the victim be given a

reasonable opportunity to be heard before any motion for a new trial is granted. °!°
