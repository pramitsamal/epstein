2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *970

As of this writing, the ultimate disposition of Senator Kyl's bill remains uncertain. But what 1s certain is that congressional
interest in crime victims’ rights will remain strong. Congress has been working on far reaching crime victims’ rights legislation
for several decades now and, indeed, many in Congress favor an amendment to the United States Constitution to protect
victims' rights. °!! Against that backdrop, it is unlikely that Congress will permit the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to
only haphazardly protect victims’ rights. If the Advisory Committee does not complete the task of comprehensively reforming
the Rules to protect victims, Congress almost certainly will - and should - finish the job.
