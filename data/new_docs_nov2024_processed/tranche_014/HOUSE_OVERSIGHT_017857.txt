function of “financing ... investments in
productive projects of a commercial na-
ture”).

NCB also urges that O'Connell Machin-
ery Co. v. M.V. “Americana,” 734 F.2d 115
(2d Cir.1984), mandates the finding that
the PIF is a political subdivision of the
Kingdom. In O'Connell, the Second Cir-
cuit reasoned that the legislative history of
the FSIA indicated that “political subdivi-
sions” were intended to include “all gov-
ernmental units beneath the central gov-
ernment.” Jd. (quoting H.R.Rep. No.
1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 15, reprinted in,
1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6613). Given the
PIF’s position under the Ministry of Fi-
nance, O'Connell could lead to the conclu-
sion that the PIF is a political subdivision
of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Jd.; but
see In re Ski Train Fire, 198 F.Supp.2d at
425 n. 9 (distinguishing O’Connell on
grounds that the court based its holding on
a finding that the Italian government dou-
ble-tiered its administrative agencies);
Ayatt, 945 F.Supp. at 683-84 (finding defi-
nition of “political subdivision” in O’Con-
nell too broad and suggesting the case
should be limited to its facts and not ap-
plied widely). In the twenty years since
O'Connell was decided, however, courts
have been inclined to limit the FSIA’s
grant of immunity. See, eg., Dole Food,
538 U.S. at 4738-74, 128 8.Ct. 1655; Filler,
378 F.3d at 218. Accordingly, the Court
will not rely on O'Connell here.

b. Limited Jurisdictional Discovery
is Warranted

[13] The Court finds that resolution of
the PIF’s and thereby NCB’s status is not
determinable on the current record and,
therefore, limited jurisdictional discovery
is warranted. As explained above, the
PIF could qualify either as an organ or
political subdivision of the Kingdom of Sa-
udi Arabia. Additionally, the affidavits on

349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES

which the parties ask the Court to rely
have not been subjected to cross examina-
tion and are rather self-serving. The par-
ties should have the opportunity to take
discovery of the jurisdictionally relevant
facts. First City, 150 F.3d at 177; see also
In re Magnetic Audiotape Antitrust Litig.,
334 F.3d 204, 208 (2d Cir.2003) Gnstructing
district court to permit discovery before
granting motion to dismiss based on fact-
sensitive, multi-factor test). Accordingly,
NCB’s motion to dismiss for lack of sub-
ject matter jurisdiction based on the FSIA
is denied without prejudice. Limited ju-
risdictional discovery will be permitted to
explore PIF’s function, organizational
structure, and place within the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia.

D. Application of FSIA Exceptions
to the Princes and Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia

Three exceptions to foreign sovereign
immunity are implicated in these mo-
tions—the commercial activities exception,
28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2), the state sponsor of
terrorism exception, 28 U.S.C.
§ 1605(a)(7), and the torts exception, 28
U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5).

1. Commercial Activities Exception

[14] Section 1605(a)(2) states:
A foreign state shall not be immune ...
in any case ... in which the action is
based ... upon an act performed in the
United States in connection with a com-
mercial activity of the foreign state else-
where; or upon an act outside the terri-
tory of the United States in connection
with a commercial activity of the foreign
state elsewhere and that act causes a
direct effect in the United States.
28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)@2). The statute de-
fines “commercial activity” as “either a
regular course of commercial conduct or a
particular commercial transaction or act.
