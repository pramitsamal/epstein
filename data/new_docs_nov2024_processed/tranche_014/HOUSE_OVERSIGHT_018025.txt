| gather you’re talking about legal academia.
Yes, it’s a cesspool of jealousy. People in it lack courage.

But you’re no stranger to harsh criticism. People weren’t exactly nominating you
for a justice award for getting O.J. Simpson and Claus von Bulow off the hook.

Some of the criticisms against me have been just. I’m a tough lawyer. But charging me
with one of the most heinous crimes is on a different level. I’ve never been attacked like
this. | don’t Know any lawyer or professor who’s had these accusations waged against
them. It’s worse than what Clarence Darrow had to face.

You retired from Harvard Law School a year ago. Did you expect so much

excitement at this stage of your career?

This is an absolute shock. |’m living my little life here [in Florida, New York and Martha's
Vineyard]. | lead a boring life. I've been married to the same woman for 28 years. She
goes with me everywhere. People know that | won’t argue a case or give a speech

unless my wife travels with me. This is not the profile of someone who screws around.
You take all this very, very personally, don’t you?

Wouldn't you? |’ve got two grandchildren in college and they are reading this about me.
This is the fight of my life.

Note: We have been in contact with Edwards and Cassell and hope to get their sides of
the story soon.
