ALAN DERSHOWITZ,

Defendant.

AFFIDAVIT OF DAVID S. STONE

L, I am a member of the Bars of New Jersey and New York and am the Senior Managing
Partner of the Stone & Magnanini Law Firm.

Zi I am acquainted with Alan Dershowitz having worked with him professionally on the
Claus Von Bulow matter and we have remained friendly ever since. Approximately from
November 2002 to March 2009, I was a Partner at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP’s New
Jersey office.

a I make this affidavit to set forth what my testimony would be if called to testify
concerning my knowledge of the events described herein.

4, In or about May 2015, I received a call from Mr. Dershowitz who told me that a client of
Mr. Boies’ law firm was accusing Mr. Dershowitz of having had sexual relations with her
when she was under the age of consent. Mr. Dershowitz said he had been trying to
contact Mr. Boies with no success and he knew that Mr. Boies and I had worked together.
Mr. Dershowitz told me that the accusations were absolutely false and asked me if I
would contact Mr. Boies and arrange for them to meet so that he could attempt to
convince Mr. Boies that the accusations were false. I agreed to do so, and in that
connection attended at least three meetings that included both Mr. Boies and Mr.
Dershowitz and spoke to Mr. Dershowitz separately. I believe Ms. McCawley attended
at least two of the meetings.

5: I am informed that Mr. Dershowitz has asserted that at a meeting on May 19, at which I
was present Mr. Boies stated “Roberts was mistaken in naming me as someone with
whom she had sex” and “that if he failed to persuade her of that fact, he would leave her
representation to Edwards and Cassell and no longer represent her.” Mr. Boies did not
say that on May 19 or at any other time when I was present.
