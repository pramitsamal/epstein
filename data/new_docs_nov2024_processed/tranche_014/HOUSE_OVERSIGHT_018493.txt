And of course, substance abuse problems are a whole nother ballgame. But if a person
has been drinking a glass of wine with dinner every night for 10 years, then I'm not going
to tell her that I consider her incapable of doing BDSM after dinner.

I am not qualified to comment on non-alcohol drugs because I, of course, never do
anything illegal. But for all your drug-related questions, the website Erowid.org is often
very useful.

* Illness. I don't have any particular observations about how being sick changes my
experience of S&M, but it definitely does. When I get sick and I have the option to
reschedule a date, I always do.

* Aaand finally, menstrual cycle. I haven't tracked my cycle with enough care to know
exactly how it affects me S&M-wise, but I'm pretty sure it does. As one of the good
people at EduKink once observed, The great part about playing with a woman is that
you have 28 different partners, one for each day of the month!

S&M:
[theory] Going Under

This was originally published in 2011. People have asked me whether there's any actual
research out there on the altered states that some people access through S&M; as far as
I know, there isn't. It's also worth noting that a lot of dominant partners go into another
kind of zone that's sometimes called top-space.

Going Under

Come back, an S&M partner said softly, the other day, pushing my hair out of my eyes.
I blinked and shook my head in a futile attempt to clear it.

That's weird, I said. Someone else used to say those words to me when I was coming
out of subspace. I... that's weird.”

I'm not surprised, he said. It's a natural thing to say to you. You go under so fast, and
so deep. You're so far away.

Not all the time, I said. And not with everyone. You're good at putting me there.”

He smiled. You bring it out in me.”
