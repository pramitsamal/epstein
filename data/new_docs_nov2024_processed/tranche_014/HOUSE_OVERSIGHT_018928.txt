REITER jrom 1B

ney’s office for two reasons.
First, he pressed for Epstein
to be charged with the more
serious crimes of sexual ac-
tivity with minors. Second, he
slammed State Attorney Bar-
ryKrischer in blunt language
seldom used by one law-
erfforcement official con-
cerning another because of
what he perceived as that of
fice’s mishandling of the
case.

‘vIn a letter to Krischer

written May 1, Reiter called’

his actions in the Epstein
case “highly unusual.” He
added, “Imusturge youto...
consider if good and suffi-
cient reason exists to require
your disqualification from the
prosecution of these cases.’
In short, Reiter told the
county’s top prosecutor for
the past 13 years that he
ought to get off the case. “It

‘looks like a departure from

professionalism,” Miami-
Dade State Attorney
Katherine Fernandez Rundle
said of Reiter’s letter.
Following Epstein’s in-
dictment, Reiter referred the
case to the FBI to determine
whether the _ super-rich,
super-connected defendant
had violated any federal laws.

Reiter won’t discuss the
case or the broadsides aimed
at him. But others almost
uniformly use one word to
describe the chief: profes-
sional.

“I have always been im-
pressed by Mike’s profes-
sionalism and his leader-
ship,” said Rick Lincoln, chief
of the Lantana Police Depart-
ment and a Palm Beach
County cop for 32 years.

“The town of Palm Beach
has a very professional police
department. We all consider

Mike to be our peer and a-

man of integrity.”

Reiter: Town
Manager Peter
Elwell says the
Palm Beach
police chief's
well worth his
$144,000 sal-
ary.

Juno Beach Police Chief
H.C. Clark II agreed. Al-
though he doesn’t know Re-
iter well, he has met with him
on countywide law enforce-
ment issues. “T’ve never seen
him lose his cool. I’ve never
seen anything but a profes-
sional demeanor from him.”

Reiter joined the Palm
Beach Police Department in
1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year
patrol job at the University of
Pittsburgh. His personnel
jacket shows consistently ex-
cellent job evaluations.

Posh Palm Beach is no
hotbed of crime, and in his
first year on the job, a resi-

dent confined to his home
with a sick child thanked Re-
iter for delivering afew Cokes

to the house. Reiter refused -

payment for the beverages.
Another resident thanked
Reiter for shutting off his
car’s headlights in his drive-
way, saying a valet must have
been at fault.

Reiter worked everything
from road patrol to organized
crime, vice and narcotics.
And he’s no novice at investi-
gations involving the island’s

rich and famous. He was the ©

lead detective probing the
drug overdose death of David
Kennedy in 1984. He also was
one of the officers who
worked the investigation of
William Kennedy Smith, who
was charged in 1991 — and
later acquitted — with raping
a woman at the Kennedy
family compound in Palm
Beach.

Reiter, who has amaster’s
degree in human resource

, Integrity

development from Palm

Beach Atlantic University, al- .

so has attended the FBI Na-
tional Academy in Quantico,

Va., and management cours

es at Harvard. He’s been ac‘
tive in countywide interagen-
cy law enforcement
organizations and has a “top
secret” national security
clearance.

“He has a_ perspective
that’s broader than just ad-
dressing the needs of the
town,” said Town Manager
Peter Elwell, who promoted
Reiter from assistant chief to
chief in March 2001. Reiter
makes more than $144,000 as
the town’s top cop. Elwell
thinks he’s worth it.

“He’s very businesslike,
very straightforward. He's
not easily agitated or flam-
boyant. He’s about the work,
Elwell said. “I think that his
service as chief has been
outstanding in five-plus
years,’
