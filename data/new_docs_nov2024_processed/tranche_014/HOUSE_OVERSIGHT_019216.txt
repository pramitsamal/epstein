Cosgrove has criticized Obamacare and in September appeared on CNBC's “Squawk

Box” saying that health-care providers are drowning in paperwork.

“The number of quality metrics that we have to report to the government every year is
just going up like crazy. We're now reporting well over 100 quality metrics on a regular
basis,” he said, describing regulation paperwork as coming in seven-foot-tall stacks of
16,000 pages.

Also in the meeting were Bruce Moskowitz, described as a physician in Palm Beach,
and Isaac Perlmutter, chief executive officer of Marvel Entertainment. We can't
explain what he was doing there.

Separately, former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson was expected to meet with
Trump later in the day to discuss Obamacare reform, according to a pool report.
Thompson served as secretary of health and human services during George W. Bush's
first term.
