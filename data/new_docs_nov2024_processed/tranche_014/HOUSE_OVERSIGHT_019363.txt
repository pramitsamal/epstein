he was charged with soliciting a prosti-

Epstein was indicted last week by a
state grand jury, according to state at
torney’s spokesman Mike Edmondson.
Despite Epstein’s arrest, the indictment
containing the allegations remained
sealed Sunday and Edmondson provid-
ed no details.

Unlike most accused johns, Epstein

The remaining charges were

dropped.

name has turned up in New
York City’s tabloids. The New
York Post noted he flew Pres-
ident Clinton and Kevin
Spacey to Africa on his pri-
vate Boeing 727. In 2003, the
paper dubbed him one of the
Big Apple’s “top studs,”

square foot Palm Beach es-
tate once owned by health-
care magnate Abe Gosman.
Trump topped Epstein with a
$41.35 million bid.
