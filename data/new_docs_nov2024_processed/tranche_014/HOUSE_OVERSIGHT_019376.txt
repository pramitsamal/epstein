WINGED GARGOYLES guarded the gate at Jeffrey
Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion. Inside, hidden cameras
trolled two rooms, while the girls came and went.

For the police detectives
who sifted through the gar-
bage outside and kept
records of visitors, it was the
lair of a troubling target.

Epstein, one of the most
mysterious of the country’s
megarich, was known as
much for his secrecy as for
his love of fine things: mag-
nificent homes, private jets,

eautiful women, friendships
with the world’s elite.

But at Palm Beach police
headquarters, he was be
coming known for something

else: the regular arrival of
teenage girls he hired to give
him massages and, police
say, perform sexual favors.

Epstein was different
from most sexual abuse sus-
pects; he was far more pow-
erful. He counted among his
friends former President Bill
Clinton, Donald Trump and
Frince Andrew, along with
some of the most prominent
legal, scientific and business
minds in the country.
