2. The US has significant risk (30% or greater) of experiencing pronounced Japan-
like symptoms over the next 5-10 years: especially much lower medium term growth

3. The G-20 is right to focus on containing global (current account) imbalances to
well below their pre-crisis levels (say to roughly half or less within four years). US

significantly appreciate over time, and redirect production towards domestic
demand instead of exports.
