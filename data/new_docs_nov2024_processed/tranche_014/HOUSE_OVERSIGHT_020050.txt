Hyper-by-the-book Rod Rosenstein—heretofore the quintessential apolitical player—
immediately became, in Washington eyes, a hopeless Trump tool. But Rosenstein’s
revenge was deft, swift, overwhelming, and (of course) by the book.

Given the decision of the attorney general to recuse himself from the Russia
investigation, it fell under the authority of the deputy attorney general to determine
whether a conflict existed—that is, whether the deputy attorney general, because of self-
interest, might not be able to act objectively—and if, in his sole discretion, he judged a
conflict to exist, to appoint an outside special counsel with wide powers and
responsibilities to conduct an investigation and, potentially, a prosecution.

On May 17, twelve days after FBI director Comey was fired, without consulting the
White House or the attorney general, Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert
Mueller to oversee the investigation of Trump’s, his campaign’s, and his staff’s ties to
Russia. If Michael Flynn had recently become the most powerful man in Washington for
what he might reveal about the president, now Mueller arguably assumed that position
because he had the power to make Flynn, and all other assorted Trump cronies and
flunkies, squeal.

Rosenstein, of course, perhaps with some satisfaction, understood that he had delivered
what could be a mortal blow to the Trump presidency.

Bannon, shaking his head in wonder about Trump, commented drily: “He doesn’t
necessarily see what’s coming.”
