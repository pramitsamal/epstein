Revenue Growth: Observations from Previous Slide

We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of
revenue and expenses. We did not choose the most recent 40-year period (1969
to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent significant
tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969 and subsequently many metrics (like individual
income and corporate profit) varied significantly from ‘normal’ levels.

Total USA Inc. revenue (collected via taxes) has grown at an average 3%
annual rate, in-line with 40-year GDP growth rate. Corporate taxes have -— on
average — grown at 2% annually over 40 years. Social insurance taxes (for
Social Security and Medicare) have grown at an average 5% annual rate,
above the 3% GDP growth.

Questions:

1) How crucial is the role played by lower relative tax rates — especially for
corporations — in stimulating job and GDP growth and helping American maintain /
gain / constrain loss of global competitive advantage?

2) Should social insurance tax growth be more closely aligned with GDP growth?
