For Each of the Major Problems, We Highlight:

1) Mathematical Illustrations and 2) Policy Options

e Mathematical Illustrations
— Here we simply calculate how big a revenue increase and/or expense
decrease each major entitlement program needs to reach financial break-
even.
— These calculations are merely mechanical illustrations and are not meant to
portray realistic solutions.

e Policy Options

— We do not take a view on preferred policy options.

— We present policy options from our healthcare experts + 3 party
organizations (such as the Congressional Budget Office and National
Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform) in an easy-to-understand
format to raise awareness and illustrate the financial impact of policy
decisions.
