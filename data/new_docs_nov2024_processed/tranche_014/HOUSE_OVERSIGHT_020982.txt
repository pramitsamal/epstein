Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Social + Economic + Legal Factors

Drive Incentives to Spend

1) Social — Growing + aging population (with related
disproportionate spending on end-of-life care) and unhealthy
lifestyles.

2) Economic — Healthcare service providers have financial
incentives to perform more services and drive revenue while
consumers often have little incentive to manage incremental
cost.

3) Legal - Rising overhead from defensive medicine (to avoid
lawsuits) and from regulatory compliance costs.
