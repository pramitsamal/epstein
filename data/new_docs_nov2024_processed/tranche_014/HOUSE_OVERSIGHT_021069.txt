Federal Debt Held by the Public vs. Gross Debt

e Federal Debt Held by the Public ($9 Trillion Outstanding, 62% of GDP in 2010)
- Value of all federal securities sold to the public that are still outstanding.

- Represents the cumulative effect of past federal borrowing on today’s economy and on the
current federal budget.

- Net interest payments represent a burden on current taxpayers.

e Gross Debt ($14 Trillion Outstanding, 94% of GDP in 2010)

- Public debt + intragovernmental debt (related to entities including the Social Security Trust
Fund and federal employee / veterans’ pension fund) + net liability of GSEs (related to likes
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).

- Represents a claim on both current and future resources.

e We Focus on Public Debt Levels
- Public debt is the base for calculating net interest payments.

- Gross debt level could be misleading (to take an extreme example, simply eliminating all
trust funds without changing promised benefits for the associated programs would
dramatically reduce gross debt from 94% of GDP to 62% of GDP without improving long-
term fiscal outlook at all*).

- In the future, when intragovernmental debt + net liability of GSEs begin demanding
repayments, it is likely financed via material increases in public debt levels.
