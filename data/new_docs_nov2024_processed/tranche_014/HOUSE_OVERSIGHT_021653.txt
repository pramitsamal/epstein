WEST PALM BEACH
— The line of civil law-
suits against billionaire
financier Jeffrey Epstein
has grown again, with
the filing of at least the
12th claim. by a young
woman who also says
she was lured to his Palm
Beach mansion as a teen
and sexually abused.

Prominent Miami at-
torney Robert Josefsberg
filed the most recent
federal lawsuit last week,
on behalf of the Jane Doe

‘ 101 who allegedly visited
Epstein a few times while
17 years old and was paid
$200 at least once for her
time there, according to
the complaint.

The lawsuit mirrors
facts alleged in other
suits: that Epstein had a
predilection: for teenage
girls, identified poor,
vulnerable ones and
lured them to his home
via other young women.
The teens describe as-
cending a staircase lined
with nude photographs
of young girls and to the
spa room where Epstein
would appear in a small
towel,

Miami attorney Adam
Horowitz, who repre-
sents six other Jane

Does, said Monday that

the cases are still in the
“discovery” process,
with plaintiffs request-
ing from Epstein phone
records, pictures, videos.
Horowitz said Epstein is
refusing to turn over the
materials, citing a Fifth
Amendment right not to
do so. “Stonewalling and
delaying,” Horowitz said.
“I'm not surprised.”

Horowitz said he has
asked US. District Judge
Kenneth Marra to order
Epstein to turn over the
information.

A local attorney for
Epstein, Jack Goldberger,
did not respond to a ré-
quest seeking comment.

Epstein was jailed
in July 2008 following a
plea deal where he was
sentenced to 18 months
in jail for solicitation of
prostitution and procur-
ing a person under the
age of 18 for prostitu-
tion and must register
as a sex offender. He is
serving his sentence at
the Palm Beach County
Stockade, according to
jail records, and is due
out in September.
