behalf of crime victims. She received the 2011 National Crime Victims’ Rights
Service Award as well as the Attorney General’s Project Safe Childhood Award.

He also pointed out that the parents of the victim in the Texas man’s case wrote a
letter thanking Villafana at the conclusion of the case.

“AUSA Villafafia has spent her 18-year career advocating tirelessly on behalf of
victims of some of the most serious crimes in Florida, and has received numerous
awards for her successful prosecution of major cases,” Biran said, adding that
Villafafia has “made South Florida a safer place for children and adults alike.”

Enticing a minor

By all accounts, Adam McDaniel was an awkward and shy Texas teenager who spent
countless hours on his computer, socializing with girls on the internet.

In 2005, McDaniel, then 19, traveled from Texas to Fort Lauderdale, where he
hopped into a taxi and headed to Boca Raton to meet up with a 14-year-old girl he
had been talking to online for about a year. He picked up the ninth grader at a high
school basketball game, and drove her to a Marriott, hotel where they spent the
night, court records show.

When she failed to come home that evening, her parents called Boca Raton police.
Officers tracked the pair down at the hotel the next day, where they found them in
bed, clad in little more than their underwear, according to court records.

McDaniel was arrested on federal sex charges, and pleaded guilty on Oct. 6, 2006, to
enticing a minor into sexual conduct by means of interstate commerce, which
carried a sentence of from five years up to 30 years in federal prison.
