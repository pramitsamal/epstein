25

girls going to the Epstein Palm Beach mansion and then
being sexually abused in some cases, at least one case,
forcibly raped. That is the basis for that particular
allegation.

Q. Mr. Cassell, does the police report you're
referring to at any point say Professor Dershowitz
abused any of these particular minors -- not were they
abused at the mansion -- but did it say anywhere that
Professor Dershowitz did that?

A. The police report itself does not refer to
Professor Dershowitz abusing these girls. However, when
you look at the police report, what it shows is a
pattern of egregious sexual abuse of approximately 23 to
24 young girls over an extended period of time at a
mansion that was owned by Jeffrey Epstein who was one of
the closest personal friends, from what I could gather,
of Mr. Dershowitz.

And so that was -- there's other information.
I don't want to filibuster you on that. I would be
happy to elaborate on that, but that is the first piece
of evidence that I would begin referring to. If you
want a more -- if you want -- just so the record is
clear, if you want to know all the bases, all the
grounds for which that allegation appears, then I would

like to make a more extended presentation.
