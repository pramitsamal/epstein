had said at some point like, I'm an attorney, that's my
client. So Alessi said, no, but this was not ina
lawyer/client capacity, this is in a friend capacity.

SO now we have Alessi putting him there at
the same time when young girls were there. And one of
the things that I picked up -- so is Alessi, is he able
to figure out how these girls are? A photograph of
Virginia Roberts is shown to Juan Alessi in the
deposition, and he I.D.s the photograph as, you know,
V.R., so he had put two and two together.

So now I've got V.R. coming to the house at a
time when Mr. Dershowitz is also in the house, and
apparently spending, you know, two to three nights there
and doing this four or five times a year.

Now, Alessi wasn't the only one. There was
Alfredo Rodriguez who was there about 2004 to 2005,
after the time period of Virginia Roberts, but it's part
