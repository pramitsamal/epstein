At just about this point in the narrative, the
incredulity about Epstein began to circulate in social
circles. Epstein had acquired the major symbols of
wealth but without position, public holdings, or

He’s a freelancer. That’s the rub: he doesn’t work for
anyone.

There is no clear alternate narrative. No one is
accusing him of anything, except sometimes guilt by

accused of fraud, there’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a
New York high flyer, who went to jail for a Ponzi
scheme, for whom Epstein acted as a consultant—along
with, he points out, Paul Volcker.) But the
characterization persists: if it’s not clear, it must be
murky. Sure, Goldman Sachs partners and tech
geniuses, they might have stratospheric wealth, but what
to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-like no-namer?

interpretation, that different. Both are a function of the
age of new money, both are helped by strategic
