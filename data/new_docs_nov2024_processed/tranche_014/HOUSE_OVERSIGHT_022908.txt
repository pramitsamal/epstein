News, is ever vitriolic in its coverage of Epstein), with a
twinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of
Epstein escapades. It is an outréness that Epstein seems
to cultivate. In his Paris apartment, 10,000 square feet
on the Avenue Foch, a neighborhood otherwise
occupied by foreign potentates, there is a stuffed baby
elephant in his living room—that is, the e/ephant in the
room. (Epstein says too it’s a reminder that elephants
have 23 copies of tumor suppressor genes and humans
have only 1.) The single book on his bedside table is
Lolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).

And, too, he seems often to be right. Since I began
working on this piece in September, Epstein predictions
about the price of oil, yen, ruble, and euro have all born
out. If I had invested $100,000 the way Epstein said I
should in early September, by the end of January I
would have made $2.4 million. (Alas, I did not invest.)
At any one moment, he is making a series of bets for
himself and others. Recently he identified a dozen or so
promising quants, each hawking their own special-sauce
algorithm, and planned to test their math with
investments of up to $5 million each. But don’t mistake
him for running anything like a workaday hedge fund;
this is much more a privileged association. Money is
always about the club it gets you into.

Most everyone who is now of a certain age and ambition

and status grew up in, and found they were
temperamentally suited to, the era of wealth that started
