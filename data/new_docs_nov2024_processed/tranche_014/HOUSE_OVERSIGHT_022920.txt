were underage; prostitution charges in Florida (as in
most places) have no age limits and the Palm Beach
grand jury proposed solely a solicitation charge. But
Epstein’s flamboyance and his friendship with Clinton
invited the scrutiny of the Bush FBI, and ultimately
Epstein and his legal team decided to go for a plea deal.
The result was a baroque set of agreements with both
the Feds and Palm Beach county, which mandated jail
time (Epstein was sentenced to 18 months, of which he
served 13—nearly all Florida prisoners serve only 70%
of their officially sentenced time) and sex offender
status. The deal also provided for an unusual, if not
unprecedented, arrangement by which he agreed to pay
the legal fees for 40 girls specified by the FBI in civil
suits against him and not to oppose their claims,
resulting in an overall settlement costs that may be as
high as $20 million. (A bit more baroqueness: one of the
lawyers representing some of the plaintiffs, Scott
Rothstein, would also go to jail for recruiting investors
to pay for these suits on the fraudulent basis that
settlements had already been reached and that many of
the listed women had agreed to take reduced immediate
cash payments. )

It is in part this impossible-to-explain weird-justice
outcome that has made some people think Epstein was
covering for someone, or something, else—perhaps his
most high-profile friend?
