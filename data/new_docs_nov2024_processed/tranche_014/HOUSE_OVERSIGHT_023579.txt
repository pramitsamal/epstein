Chart 9: In May, the Nasdaq recorded its longest streak of monthly gains
since 2009 (7M). However, compared to the only other instances of
longer streaks (‘86, ‘95) the current bull run is still only half the size

Chart 10: Tech valuations seem to be gaining momentum and are now at
their highest levels since before the GFC but remain far from dotcom
bubble peaks

In addition to strong price performance, lofty valuations, and exuberant inflows, asset
bubbles also tend to have two other hallmarks, best seen through the derivatives lens:
(i) asset volatility rising alongside asset prices (Charts 11 & 12), and (ii) declining

correlation as assets closest to the source of the bubble decouple from those farther

removed (Chart 11).

Chart 11: During the 2000s Tech Bubble, Tech vol rose with Tech stocks
and broader market correlations fell as Tech stocks decoupled from
other large caps — both classic signs of an asset bubble

Chart 12: Historically, in major asset bubbles, realized volatility has
tended to rise meaningfully not only after the bubble deflates, but also
in the run-up to the market peak

Weeks from peak

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

While Nasdaq 100 (NDX) implied volatility has spiked in recent weeks and now trades in
the 94 percentile as a spread to S&P 500 (SPX) implied volatility (Chart 14), the
absolute level of NDX 3M implied vol remains historically low (2¢ percentile since Jun-
09). In our view, at least for now, the spread widening is more of a response to the

outsized sell-off seen in Tech stocks on 17-May rather than the volatility market trying
to price in the onset of another Tech Bubble. Indeed, the -2.5% drop in the NDX on 17-
May was a six standard deviation (60) event relative to trailing realized volatility (and the
fourth worst risk-adjusted daily return since 1985), even more extreme than the 50
decline experienced by the S&P.
