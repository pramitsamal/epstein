Volatility in Asia

Use best-of puts to cheaply hedge a reversal in the rally
BofAML global strategists note that the massive central bank liquidity supernova has
allowed the Wall Street bull to flare higher, led by uber growth (EM internet stock
returns annualizing 125%). In light of this, we feel that it is prudent that investors
protect gains as we think today’s low volatility environment remains highly fragile,
characterized by the below stats:

« The MSCI Asia Pac index is up for the 5 consecutive month and is trading at multi-
year highs, while equity foreign inflows year-to-date are at the highest since 2004.

¢ Option delta-adjusted open interest for KOSPI2 and HSI are near a 4-year highs.
* The BofAML global Risk-Love investor sentiment measure is in euphoria, and

China’s nominal GDP is likely peaking. The Asian/EM EPS upgrade cycle is likely
rolling over.

Volatility of equity indices remains at post-GFC lows while markets continue to trend
higher. If the market were to realize a correction, we believe that indices would be
highly correlated, and hence we recommend buying a 14-Sep-2017 95% strike best-of
put on NKY/KOSPI2/HSI that costs 0.8%, a 45% discount to average vanilla puts.
