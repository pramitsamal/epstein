Cognitive Process-Based Education 7

The answer to this is simple enough. School was not designed to help
kids live better lives. That was never the point. But shouldn’t it be?”

From a cognitive growth point of view, school wasn’t even de-
signed to teach us things that relate to learning per se.

Scholars designed the subject matter of the current school system.
You hear sportscasters describe football players as scholar-athletes. Real-
ly? Scholars? Why would that be what we are seeking to create? There
are only so many jobs for scholars, and while scholarship is very nice,
it ought not be the goal we seek in school in a system of universal
education.

Yes, but dating? Is that the subject I am proposing? Really?

Let me explain the real issue here. Take a look at the items I
mentioned above.

We have learned that learning about how other people behave is
very important.

We have learned that learning about one’s own emotions and
feelings is very important.

We have learned that building confidence is very important.

We have learned that learning to listen is very important.

We also have learned that learning how to express oneself is very
important.

Now, I will transform these slightly:

Students need to learn about how other people behave and why,
and they need to learn how to interact with different kinds of
people.

Students need to learn about their own emotions and feelings
and how to deal with them.

Students need to learn how to rely on themselves and feel
confident in their own abilities.

Students need to learn how to listen to others and really hear
what they are saying.

Students need to learn how to express themselves effectively.

Now this list doesn’t seem so crazy, does it? In fact, most parents will
tell you that they try very hard to teach all these things to their chil-
dren. So one argument might be that the school doesn’t have to do it,
since parents do it.
