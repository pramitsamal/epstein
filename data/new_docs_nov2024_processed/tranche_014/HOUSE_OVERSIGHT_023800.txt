and at school. Parties to those agreements have the right to complain
if obligations are not met. Learning to make a contract, legal or not,
is a big part of being a rational actor. To make a contract one must
negotiate it. Negotiation often is seen as something only politicians
and high-powered business leaders do. But, actually, we negotiate with
waitresses for good service and we negotiate with our children when
we give them an allowance. Learning how to negotiate can be done
only by trying and learning from failures. The techniques tend to be
context-independent, but there is, of course, special knowledge about
real estate and politics (for example, the relevant laws) that makes one
a better negotiator in each situation. Again, practice with coaching is
the ideal.

4. Describing: Creating and using conscious descriptions of
situations to identify faults to be fixed

When problems exist in any situation, we need to be able to de-
scribe and analyze them. We need to be able to describe them in order
to get help from people who may know more about the situation than
we do. We need to learn to focus on the critical issues. In order to do
this, we need also to be able to analyze these situations to see what was
supposed to happen and why it isn’t happening. Consultants who try
to fix failing businesses do this sort of thing all the time, as do doctors
when consulting on difficult cases. Creating a careful description of
a situation is a skill that can be learned only through practice. This
sometimes is described as learning an elevator speech to tell someone
succinctly what you are doing. This ability is a very important part of
understanding and helping others understand.

Now let’s see what we have. First let’s list again the types of cognitive
processes that underlie learning:

Conceptual processes

1. Prediction

2. Judgment

3. Experimentation
4. Evaluation
