This South Beach newcomer lives up to the hype. Set in two landmark Now Live
Art Deco buildings on Collins Avenue, right behind the former Versace
Mansion, the boutique hotel has 108 sleek guestrooms washed in blue
and white, and access to soft, sandy beaches, a restaurant helmed by
chef Geoffrey Zakarian and a hip rooftop pool scene.
