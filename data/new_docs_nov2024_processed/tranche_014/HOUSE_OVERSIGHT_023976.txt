It's rare to find a luxury resort as down to earth as this Condé Nast
Traveler Hot List alum. Sitting on 50 wild acres of jungle by the beach,
this striking Italian-style villa has white sand-colored interiors that match
the serene beach outside. The Duchess of Ferrari originally built this
tropical hideaway on Mexico's fabled Yucatan Peninsula in the early
1990s to entertain her globetrotting friends. It has since been remade as
a 29-room boutique wonder, where that local culture is so intrinsic to the
design that it can be found in the minutest details.
