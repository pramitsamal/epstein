Members of the New Leaf team invested $1.02 billion in the portfolios of healthcare
technology investments in four Sprout Capital funds (Sprout Capital IX, L.P., Sprout
Capital VII, L.P., Sprout Capital VI, L.P. and Sprout Growth H, L.P.), and these are now
fully realized (or near fully realized in the case of Sprout Capital IX, L.P.). The net
annual IRR’s on the healthcare technology portfolios in these funds outperformed the
S&P 500 (568 - 2,258 bps), S&P Healthcare (302 - 2,064 bps), NASDAQ Composite (451 -
2,125 bps), and the Russell 3000 (502 - 2,215 bps) using the Public Market Equivalent
Plus (PME+) methodology’. Although PME+ methodology is most informative when
used to analyze funds whose returns are mature, the PME+ methodology shows that
NLV-I is outperforming these same indices, and shows encouraging results for NLV-II
despite its relative immaturity.

It is this consistently high level of return over an 18 year period, spanning several challenging
investment cycles, that creates a truly unique track record within the venture capital sector.

The chart below illustrates details of the gross and net performance by fund.
