e Reasons for Underperformance

Much of this recent underperformance can be explained by investors’ textbook preference, coming out of
recession, to add high-beta stocks and shed low-growth utilities. This was exacerbated by:
o soft power demand growth (particularly in Europe);
generation overcapacity;
delays in capital spending;
lower commodity prices (particularly as a result of US shale gas production);
central banks’ quantitative easing;
political interference (notably in Europe);
high debt loads;
the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan; and
© concerns about interest rate rises from today’s very low levels.
It is hard to imagine a more perfect storm for the global utility sector than that which has played out
over the past 4 years.

e Potential Exists for Snarp Outperformance

Globally or regionally, it is not unusual to find long and/or sharp periods of utility underperformance (as
with the current record period). During such periods, when combined with wholesale shorts and market
underweighting, the sector becomes poised for extended outperformance rallies. This results from
fundamental investors (both long/short and long-only) rotating into the sector en masse, bidding up the
best value and growth utilities and underweighting or shorting utilities with poor business
