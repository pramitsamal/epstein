8.2. The Education Market

Education is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross
national income of $48 trillion.'’ In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1.0 trillion market with for-
profit education accounting for $81 billion or 7.8% of this amount.® The for-profit component of this
industry (pre-K-12, post secondary and corporate training) is projected to grow faster than the overall
historical industry growth rate, at a 7.4% annual rate, reflecting the increasing importance of for-profit
operations in the sector, to reach a market size of $116 billion by 2010.'® Education is still predominantly
provided by public / governmental entities in most countries including the U.S. KUE believes that the
industry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the evolution observed
in the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and telecommunications.

8.3. The U.S. Early Childcare or “pre-K” Market

The highly fragmented early childcare or “pre-K” market includes care based in homes and housed by
community organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, YMCAs) and center based facilities. Center-
based childcare includes preschools (nurseries), workplace centers (located on-site at the company),
lease-model centers (located in a real estate developer's office building), back-up centers (a variety of on-
site and off-site back-up care programs) and family day-care facilities (located in someone’s home or
center). Although childcare may evoke thoughts of a babysitting service, education has become an
increasingly important element in services to pre-K children. However, the education-focused portion of
the childcare market remains relatively small.

Since the early 1980s, center-based ECE has become the care provider of choice for families. The U.S.
ECE unit generated an estimated $54 billion in total spending in 2005, representing a 10% compound
annual growth rate since 1982. Approximately five million or 60% of 3 to 5-year-olds with working
mothers are enrolled in ECE centers.*° The following growth drivers are expected to continue to fuel
growth in the early childcare market: growing importance of ECE, demographics (e.g., more children aged
five and younger), increase in families with two working parents, more educated parents, corporations
recognizing the benefits of childcare services and tax incentives and other positive legislation.

The perception of ECE as a fundamental component of child development has contributed to average
annual fee increases of roughly 7% amongst center-based facilities, reflecting the stable, relatively
inelastic nature of the demand for higher quality care.*‘ The number of children receiving childcare
