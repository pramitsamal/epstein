— 845 Centers in 37 States

12.4. Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion

The table below shows KLC PropCo pro forma historical results for 2005 assuming the division of KLC
OpCo and KLC PropCo in the series of transactions completed in November 2005 (the “Real Estate
Transactions”) and related financing, together with the lease of KLC PropCo-owned centers to KLC OpCo,
occurred on January 1, 2004. Projected results presented below are based on assumptions management
believes to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. KLC PropCo’s
ability to perform as projected depends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty
and actual performance could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in
“Risk Factors,” particularly the risk factor related to projected financial statements, elsewhere in this
Memorandum. Also see “Forward Looking Statements.”
