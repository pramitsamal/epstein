size of the legalized cannabis market expanded significantly, doubling the size of the overall market in
each of these states in the first full calendar year after implementation. The world has yet to experience
a legalized recreational cannabis market in a jurisdiction as large as California, and how the supply
chain, consumer response and regulatory framework will coalesce in such a market remains to be seen.
