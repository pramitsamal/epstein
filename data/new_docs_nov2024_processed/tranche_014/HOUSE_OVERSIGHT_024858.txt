COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS

February 25, 2019

There are a solid amount of beverage companies currently playing within the space,
largely price positioned within the mainstream and value segments of the market. We
would highlight that on a price per mg basis, beverages skew higher across the board,

relative to tinctures, capsules and gummies.

Note: Reflects price per mg of CBD; For companies with multiple SKUs, we used a straight line average

Based on our survey, of respondents that use CBD, 19.2% use beverages as a form
factor, which is admittedly higher than we would’ve expected given the nascent stage of
the category. Similar to both capsules and topicals, beverage use is a more popular
choice among younger, lower income consumers (by a wider margin relative to other
age cohorts compared to the other categories). This leaves us optimistic on the future
prospects of the category as a waterfall effect can result in an increase in category mix.
