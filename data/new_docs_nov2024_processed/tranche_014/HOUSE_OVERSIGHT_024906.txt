Figure 125 GWPCARES3: Reduction In Drop Seizures

month and the average age of patients in the trial was 16 yrs, although 30% were 18 yrs
or older. On the primary endpoint, 20 mg/kg Epidiolex produced a median reduction in
monthly drop seizures of 42% compared to a reduction of 17% in patients taking
placebo, p=0.0047. There was also a suggestion of a dose response in the data, with the
lower 10 mg/kg/day dose of Epidiolex producing a median reduction in monthly drop
seizures of 37%, p=0.0016. In both dose groups the difference between Epidiolex and
placebo emerged during the first month of treatment and was sustained during the
entire treatment period. GW disclosed that the trial's secondary endpoints, and a series
of sensitivity analyses, confirmed the robustness of the results. Similar to Epidiolex's
other Phase Ill studies, although patients on clobazam (51%) had some additional
benefit, GW indicated that Epidiolex also showed efficacy in patients not on clobazam.

Additional data were presented at AAN 2017. Included in this presentation were several

of the trial's secondary endpoints and a series of sensitivity analyses. All of these
confirmed the robustness of the results. For example, the proportion of patients witha
>50% reduction in seizure frequency was 40% for 20 mg/kg Epidiolex (p<0.001), 36% for

10 mg/kg Epidiolex (p<0.01), and 15% for placebo. The proportion of patients with a
>75% reduction in seizure frequency was 25% for 20 mg/kg Epidiolex (p<0.01), 11% for
10 mg/kg (p<0.05) Epidiolex, and 3% for placebo. The proportion of patients who

achieved seizure freedom was 7% for 20 mg/kg Epidiolex, 4% for 10 mg/kg Epidiolex,

and 1% for placebo.
