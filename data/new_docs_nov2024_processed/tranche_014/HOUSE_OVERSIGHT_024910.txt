Hemp plants have been used for industrial applications for thousands of years. Hemp
stalk fiber was traditionally used as a textile for use in rope; clothing; and sails due to its
tensile strength. Hemp seeds are used in foods and compressed to make oils that were
used as a lighting fuel. The original diesel engine was designed to run on a variety of
biodiesel fuels, including vegetable oils and seed oils, which included hempseed oil. In
1937, hemp production was banned due to its similarity to marijuana despite low THC
presence, but to aid the war effort the federal government requested that farmers plant
industrial hemp to make up for a shortfall in imports from the Asian Pacific. Farmers
planted 36,000 acres of hemp in 1942 and set a target of 50,000 acres in order to
produce the 34,000 feet of hemp that was needed in each Naval battleship and for
other textile uses. The cheap availability of petroleum based synthetic products and
federal regulations against hemp production caused hemp production to decline rapidly
again after the war in the U.S. and throughout most of Europe. As hemp now looks to
make a comeback in light of recent legislation, we see the use cases for industrial hemp
to include many of the traditional textile and food uses that were previously common, in
addition to the growing CBD market.

Sustainability Of CBD And Hemp Production

As the CBD industry grows in size, we believe that producers will look to minimize the
environmental impact of production. In addition, we could see producers try to monetize
the entire waste stream of the hemp production process by converting parts of the
plant that aren’t used to produce CBD or other products into biomass energy. We
believe the most common use cases for hemp biomass will be in the form of pelleting for
