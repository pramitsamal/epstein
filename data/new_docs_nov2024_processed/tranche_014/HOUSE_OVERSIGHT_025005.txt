evidenced by the heated rhetoric, is a perfect foil that can be easily
activated at a moment’s notice.

Israel, for historical, emotional and realpolitik considerations, has
been one of Washington’s closest allies with great support of both
aisles of the political divide. A deepening crisis could even pit the
administration against Congress. This may be one of the outcomes
the Turks are banking on. The Netanyahu government has much to
answer for in its lack of leadership and navel gazing. But Washington
did not read Turkish intentions and goals accurately and therefore
could not prevent this turn of events. Whichever way one looks at it,
it is a failure of U.S. diplomacy that it will now have to constantly
have to act as a buffer between two of its close allies.
