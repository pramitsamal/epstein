What's Wrong with the Palestinians
Appealing to the UN?'

An interview with Arab League Head Nabil Elaraby

Pro-democracy uprisings are continuing in the Middle East and the
Palestinians could soon declare statehood. SPIEGEL spoke with
Arab League General Secretary Nabil Elaraby about the Syrian
regime's use of violence against protesters and how the US has failed
to force Israel to negotiate in good faith.

SPIEGEL: Libya has been liberated from Moammar Gadhafi's
autocratic rule. Tensions in Syria, meanwhile, have already claimed
more civilian lives than the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia
combined, and yet the Arab League is holding back. Why are you
going easy on the Syrian regime?

Elaraby: Syria isn't Libya. Libya has always been largely isolated.
What happened there had little effect on neighboring countries. It's a
completely different situation with Syria. The country holds a key
position in the region. What happens there has a direct impact on
Lebanon and Iraq. In addition, Gadhafi used heavy weapons from the
start, but Assad hasn't.

SPIEGEL: Yet tanks have been deployed in Hama, Homs and
Latakia for some time.

Elaraby: When I flew to Syria 10 days after taking office, they also
tried to tell me that there had been no riots in Aleppo or Damascus. I
was told that gun battles had only occurred in a few towns near the
border, because rebels had fired on security forces there.
