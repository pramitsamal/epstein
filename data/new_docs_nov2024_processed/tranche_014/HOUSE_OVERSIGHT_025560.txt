ARES Conversion Largely Priced In

With the recent run up of ARES stock price, the market seems to
have already priced in a good portion of the upside from conver-
sion. Year to date, ARES has out performed peers by ~10% likely on
the back of this expected conversion. As a result we have looked at
the share price of ARES at several time periods to assess what is

embedded in the price already.

We see the market valuing ARES@FRE at 18.3x, with about 3.4x turns
of multiple expansion YTD and pricing in a large degree of the poten-
tial benefit from C-corp conversion. This is just under half of the total
7.5x turns of FRE multiple expansion that we expect to see in our
upside scenario for the Alts. As a result, our upside/downside from
for ARES has a less favorable risk reward skew, as much of the upside

is already baked in.

NORTH AMERICA INSIGHT ~~

How do we arrive as such an estimate? We start with the 12/31/2017
share price of $20.00. We then gross up this starting point for the
broader performance of peers to isolate just the outperformance of
ARES vs the group. The alts group ex ARES YTD is up +10% so we use
a starting price for ARES of $21.90.

e We first estimate the implied multiple on future carry for
ARES at the pro forma stock price before C-corp conversoin
began to be priced in. (we explain this in process in greater
detail in the section on Deconstructing Ourlmplied Carry Val-
uation).

@ We then take the current share price today and assume that
the run up in price was a result purely from multiple expan-
sion on fee related earnings. In doing this we hold the per-
formance fee multiple and value of future performance fees
constant.

e@ We then back into an implied value of FRE using the various
components of the SOTP and the current share price. We
divide that value by our 2018e FRE to determine our estimate
for baked in multiple expansion at ARES. (Please see Ares

Management SOTP and Sensitivity Analysis for more
details.)
