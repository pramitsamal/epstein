Why Should Fee-Related Earnings

Re-Rate Higher?

We point to three approaches to thinking about how to
value fee-related earnings and what the right multiple
should be on this earnings stream. We believe that under
a C-corporation structure with a broader potential investor
base and ownership, this portion of the Alts earnings are
most likely to re-rate significantly higher while there could
be more variability in the multiple investors ascribe to per-
formance fees. We currently believe the market is pricing in
fee related earnings around 15x times, a discount to where
these earnings could trade up to. As we explain in greater
detail in the Appendix, we see ARES asa stock that is likely
to convert, and as we take a look at the SOTP, we believe
FRE for ARES has already seen significant expansion. We
estimate the multiple on ARES FRE has already gone up
from 15.0x to 18.4x.

Below we look at where multiples could trade for the broader
group as a whole, but acknowledge that investors likely use dif-
ferent FRE multiples for companies to account for duration of assets,
growth in AUM, franchise value etc. On average, our three
approaches suggest a 23.4x multiple for fee related earnings. In our
upside case we use a 22.5x multiple. These multiples are on 2018e fee
related earnings as we are trying to evaluate where the stocks trade

today, and where they could potentially trade to in the near term.

1) Premium to Traditionals Asset Managers

We see the historical average P/E multiple for traditional asset
managers of 15.4x as a starting point for FRE multiples. The tradi-
tional asset manager business model earns management fees with a
significantly smaller portion of revenues from performance fees rela-

tive to alternative asset managers.

We believe the AltsGmanagement fee earnings, however, com-
mand a premium multiple given several factors: A) faster organic
growth, B) stickier long-term committed assets, C) fees paid on com-
mitted capital which limits downside risk to revenues, and D) more

insulation from fee pressure.

A) Faster net organic growth in fee-paying assets under manage-
ment for Alts vs. slower growth rates at traditional asset man-
agers. The Alts have outpaced organic growth rate of traditional
asset mgrs over the past 4 years by nearly 700 bps, and we estimate
900bps of continued outperformance on average from 2018
through 2019. Organic growth has averaged 5% for the alts from the
period 2014-17e, while the traditionals have seen net outflows and
organic decay of -2%. Looking two years out, we see traditionals net
inflows of 1% vs. alts on average at 10% driven by continued fun-
draising strength and fees turning on for existing funds that have

already been raised.
