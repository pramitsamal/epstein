lran: US Congress will not stop nuclear deal; EU
already moving forward — fast. What’s next?

- P5+1 and Iran reached a deal. Big
obstacle has been overcome: Enough US
Senators support to ensure it can move
forward.

- Saudi Arabia “supports” the deal. The
Saudi king was in DC last month. US has
quietly promised nuclear protection and
massive weapons sales.

- Market implications of a deal are
significant, especially for European
corporates eager to get back into Iran
marketplace (i.e. Italian PM Renzi already
visited Tehran as has German FM).

- Iran wants to build 400 four & five star
hotels in next five to ten years.

- But do not expect any significant oil
export increase and/or sales into Iran for at
least 8 — 10 months. Iran must first comply
and set up systems for inspections.
