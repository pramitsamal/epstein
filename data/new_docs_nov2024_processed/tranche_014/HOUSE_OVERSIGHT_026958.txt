= US oil production growth has matched or exceeded global demand growth over the past year, providing ample supplies
to the market.

= In fact, OPEC had to cut production in late 2018 in order to reduce oversupply and arrest a fast decline in oil prices.

= OPEC production could be increased back to 2018 highs if the market faced a shortage. Doing so would add 1.7 million
b/d from main Middle Eastern OPEC members — more than Iran’s current export levels of around 0.5 million b/d.
