bankruptcy auction.

The stalking horse bidder, RREF H PALM HOUSE LLC, has the same
address as Related Companies in New York and is led by Related
Companies Managing Principal Justin Metz, according to a filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court. The company is offering $32 million for the property,
which will set the floor price for a bankruptcy auction scheduled for next
month. Bids at the auction will start at $32.5 million.

Cushman & Wakefield’s Robert Given, Errol Blumer, Michael Mulkern and
Robert Kaplan are the exclusive marketing advisers for the property. The
auction is scheduled for 10 a.m. on November 16, 2018 in West Palm

of Palm Beach. He said the next owner will likely not redevelop the
