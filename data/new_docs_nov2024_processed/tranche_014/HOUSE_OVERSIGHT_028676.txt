in declaring that this so-called sequester
threatens the military as well as domestic
programs. But his plan to avoid it basically
repeated the offer of a “balanced approach”
— unspecified tax hikes and spending cuts
— which Republicans have already
rejected.

Somewhat more substantively, he called for
a larger deficit-reduction deal built around
loophole-closing tax reform and what he
called “modest” reforms to Medicare and
entitlements. In an apparent effort to rally
Democrats to this cause, he called on
“those of us who care deeply about
programs like Medicare” to “embrace”
reform.

Yet in promising the same amount of
Medicare savings as the Simpson-Bowles
commision proposed, Mr. Obama did not
mention that this would be a mere $341
billion over 10 years. All told, he envisions
shaving an additional $1.5 trillion off
projected deficits over 10 years, which
would leave the national debt at a
historically aberrant 70-odd percent of
gross domestic product. In short, he
declined to push back against the mind-set
within his party that considers acceptable
“stabilizing” the debt at this level by the
time Mr. Obama’s second term ends. At
best, that would buy a respite of a few
years before the debt resumed its upward
climb.
