For instance, developers were surprised to
find out that, by a quirk in the West Bank's
notoriously Byzantine and palimpsestic
legal codes, they required the approval of a
joint Israeli-Palestinian water commission
created through the Oslo Accords to build a
sewage treatment plant in an Area A,
approval that they recently received.
There's also the still-unresolved matter of
the access road. But thus far, Rawabi had
flourished in spite of delays and
inconveniences.

Could it survive its isolation, though --
could this hilltop off of a two-lane highway
get enough water and electricity to support
45,000 people living at a middle class
standard? There is nothing here at all.
We're out in the boondocks, he conceded.
We're building everything from scratch.
One needed only to glance at the busy
construction site below to understand that
Masri considers this a point of pride, far
from a potential death-sentence for his
project.

I asked Masri about something that had
jumped out at me during the 3-D video.
The finished Rawabi, I'd noted, had the
same terraced garden parks, stoic, modular
apartment design, and concentric hilltop
roads that I had seen in Talpiyot Misrach, a
new neighborhood on the fringes of West
Jerusalem. His city looked very, well,
Israeli.
