Terrific; looking forward.

Excited to go through math candidates on the list, others too.

Equally important, discuss edits/modifications to the 13 episodes (cutting blahs), expanding math episodes
- see below. Assuming we expand math episodes, we will need more mathematicians.

How’s late afternoon after 5:30 pm / early evening today? - or weekend, day/times? (Family issues today -

RADICAL BREAKTHROUGHS - Initial Revisions (working model for discussion, red is new)

Expand and Modify Mathematical Breakthrough episodes
1. Mathematics and Truth / Overview / Show Excitement/Importance
2. Mathematical Fields / Diverse New Kinds and Categories

3. How Math Works in Disparate Areas of Knowledge (from fundamental physics to chemistry,
biology [molecular and evolutionary|, psychology, sociology, economics, etc.)

4. Power Laws
5. Mathematical Biology

6. Foundations of Mathematics / Philosophy/Meaning of Math (discovered/invented?)

ADD/Exchange to Biological Breakthrough episodes

9/10. Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems
of replicability in biomedical and psychological research - the scandal in recent years.
In the non-Closer To Truth world....
