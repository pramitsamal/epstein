RLK: Well some people would say that tariffs
have at least got China’s attention. Even some
leading people tell me privately in China that in
that sense China needs to move faster in doing
things like opening markets, like intellectual
property protection. Now they are doing some
things. They have an intellectual property
court. I visited it in Shanghai a few months
ago. It’s working really well. Much more
progress needs to be done. So in that sense the
tariffs are a beacon that tells everybody we
need to deal because everybody is going to
suffer by tariffs. The question is how we deal
with it.

China needs to make some specific changes
regarding markets, IPR, some of these other
things — they should be done subtlety and not
publicly. That’s the way to get things done.

HOST: Isee. You know, President Trump has
infamously said that trade wars are good and
they're easy to win. And you wrote about this,
why the Chinese don’t think that the U.S. could
ever win a trade war with Beijing. It was a
very long list but tell us the highlights of that.

RLK: Right — in the early days of the so-called
trade war, the Chinese media and Chinese
experts were talking very frequently about how
the U.S. can’t win.
