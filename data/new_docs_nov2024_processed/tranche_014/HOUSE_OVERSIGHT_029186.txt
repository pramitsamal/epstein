implies more freedom. Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily
on amounts in ,,kilos“. (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before
deadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum).

What I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment.
I deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines.
So please let me know if you can or cannot come.

Hi.. update.. noam cannot do anything anyway.. nor UK that week.. So, I have been able confirm I can get the
ticket for the discounted amount of 4500 Euros.. Are you game with my proposal? I have until end of Sept to
buy out the old ticket before they cancel it.

Well it depends on UK.. if they can’t do it, then alas, it would be the whole thing.. I could check for a discount
ticket of course.. and maybe even economy class... There is also a small chance that I might do the event in UK
with Noam Chomsky, and I am wondering whether, if I could convince him to join me in a dialogue at your

place whether that might change the dynamics of the event for you, and free up some more money perhaps..
