Hi Jakob

There has been a complication. The Géttingen event had to be cancelled so that means | now do not have an air ticket to Germany. |
am going to check whether | can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime |

thought | should let you know and ask whether it is possible to cover part or all of the cost for a ticket.

Lawrence.
