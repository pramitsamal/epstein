Well it depends on UK.. if they can’t do it, then alas, it would be the whole thing.. I could check for a discount
ticket of course.. and maybe even economy class... There is also a small chance that I might do the event in
UK with Noam Chomsky, and I am wondering whether, if I could convince him to join me in a dialogue at
your place whether that might change the dynamics of the event for you, and free up some more money
perhaps..

Hi Jakob

There has been a complication. The Géttingen event had to be cancelled so that means | now do not have an air ticket to Germany. |
am going to check whether | can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime |
thought | should let you know and ask whether it is possible to cover part or all of the cost for a ticket.

Lawrence.
