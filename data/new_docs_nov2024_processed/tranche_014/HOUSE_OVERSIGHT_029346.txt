The foundation's sales over the last two weeks or so accounted for over half of the volume, on average, each
day. And the foundation's average sale on each of those days was more than five times the average volume over
the previous six months. From Jan. 1 to June 10 of this year, more than five months, Valhi traded a total of 4.6
million shares. From June 11 to June 25, just over two weeks, it traded a total of 4.8 million shares -- more than
half of them sold by the Harold Simmons Foundation.

You might expect that to drive down the stock a bit? Actually the stock performed surprisingly well, all things
considered; it closed on June 10 at $6.42 and on June 25 at $5.81, down just 9.5 percent. But just that change,
from $6.42 per share to $5.81, would save Simmons's heirs almost $80 million in estate taxes.°

The foundation sold the last of its shares on June 25 (this Wednesday). Without any more shares to sell, the
foundation -- oh, wait, no, never mind, the foundation found some more shares to sell! On Wednesday, the day
that it finished selling its 2.5 million shares, it received a Gift from Affiliate of another 900,000 shares. Those
shares were gifted to the foundation by the Valhi Holding Company, the vehicle through which Simmons's heirs
own their 318.2 million shares.'°

The Foundation immediately filed a plan to sell those shares too, with an approximate date of sale of June 26
(yesterday).'' As of 1 p.m. today, I see Valhi trading in the $5.80s.

Isn't that neat? Honestly, I have no idea what's going on here.'? But if you did want to minimize your estate
taxes on a multi-billion-dollar controlled public corporation with an illiquid stock, a good way to do it would be
to have a foundation that you control dump a ton of stock on the market in the couple of weeks leading up to the
day your estate is valued for tax purposes -- and, when the foundation ran out of shares, give it a few more so it
could keep selling. If the goal of this trading isn't to minimize taxes, I'll be very disappointed. Because it's
working pretty well to do just that.

' That's based on a Schedule 13D/A referring to events of Dec. 28, 2013, but filed in February 2014 and mentioning a stock transfer
after Simmons's death (In January 2014, Contran received as excess collateral 1,100,541 Shares from the CDCT (as defined below)
and contributed 4,123,598 Shares to Dixie Rice, who contributed such shares on the same day to VHC.) I ignore that and assume
that Contran owned all of the 318.2 million shares as of December 28; the difference is small.
