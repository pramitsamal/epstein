In policy terms, this has been enormous mission creep far beyond our
national interests. The current U.S. counterinsurgency strategy
appears likely to fail. Washington and its allies will not defeat the
Taliban militarily. President Hamid Karzai’s corrupt government is
unlikely to improve significantly. The Afghan National Army cannot
take over combat missions from the U.S. in southern and eastern
Afghanistan in any realistic time frame. And the Pakistan army will
not move against Afghan Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan.

De facto Afghan partition offers the Obama administration the best
alternative to strategic defeat. The administration should stop setting
withdrawal deadlines and instead commit the United States to a long-
term combat role in Afghanistan, with roughly 35,000 to 50,000
troops, for the next seven to 10 years.

Washington should also accept that the Taliban are likely to control
most of the Pashtun south and east. The price of forestalling that is
far too high for Americans to continue paying. Washington and its
partners should let the local correlation of forces take its course in the
Pashtun homeland — while deploying U.S. air power and Special
Forces to ensure that the north and west of Afghanistan do not
succumb to the Taliban.

In Libya, the president has gotten us militarily into the middle of a
civil war in a country of little importance to the United States. And he
offers no clear strategy to reach his ambitious objectives. The
administration’s inconsistent, even incoherent, statements on the
Libya war wrestle each other for dominance in the daily news cycle,
while NATO predictably founders without robust U.S. leadership.
The U.S. should quickly end its military role in the Libyan civil war.
We should leave that to the European allies — if they want to take it
up — and return to issues of far greater importance to our country,
like our fiscal problems.
