rebel Transitional National Council with “reconcilables” from the
regime. Gaddafi himself would quit Tripoli and give up power, but
this would be an outcome of negotiations, rather than a precondition.
State Department officials are skeptical, but they should test the
emissary’s ability to deliver.

The Syrian case is also complicated by the blood-soaked history of
the regime. In a speech Monday, Assad proposed a national dialogue,
in which the democratic opposition would select 100 participants to
meet with government representatives — and plan elections and a
new constitution. Given Assad’s disappointing record, it’s doubtful
that he can or will deliver. But it makes sense to test his offer — not
least because such a process would terrify Assad’s patrons in Iran. If
the dialogue fails, the Syrian demonstrations will be all the more
potent, and Assad’s hold weaker.

These internal dialogues should be bolstered by regional support, as
with Afghanistan. The right shepherds for Libya are its newly
democratic neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia, backed by France, Britain
and Germany. In Syria, the obvious mediator-in-waiting is Turkish
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, backed by the Gulf countries.
Here’s the point: The Arab Spring should not turn into a summer of
blood, if there are diplomatic alternatives.
