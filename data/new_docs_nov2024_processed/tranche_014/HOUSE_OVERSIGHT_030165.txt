among Arabs who already suspect Turkey of harboring a so-called
neo-Ottoman agenda. Turkey's ardent support for Libyan rebels
against Moammar Gadhafi and public backing for Syrian opposition
forces have already unnerved Arab monarchist regimes that are trying
to undermine the effects of the Arab Spring and are growing
distrustful of Turkish intentions. Moreover, any move construed as
Turkey trying to facilitate the downfall of the al Assad regime would
undoubtedly create problems with Iran, a neighbor Turkey has taken
great care to avoid aggravating. Iran relies heavily on the Alawite
regime in Syria to maintain a foothold in the Levant through groups
like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas
in the Gaza Strip. Since the return of Syria to Sunni control would
unravel a key pillar of Iranian deterrent strategy, we can expect that
Iran is doing everything possible to undermine the very Syrian
opposition forces looking to Ankara for support. Turkey has avoided
confrontation with Iran thus far while working quietly to build a
Sunni counterbalance to Iranian-backed Shia in Iraq in the face of an
impending U.S. withdrawal. A power vacuum in Syria filled by
Turkish-backed Sunnis would reinforce a nascent confrontation
between Iran and Turkey with deep geopolitical underpinnings.
Nations do not have friends; they have interests. And Turkey, an
historically influential country sitting on one of the most
geopolitically complex pieces of real estate in the world, is now
finding that a foreign policy built on avoiding problems with
neighbors grinds against reality. In STRATFOR's view, this was
inevitable, which is why we took interest in Monday's issue of
Today's Zaman, an English-language outlet loyal to the movement of
Fethullah Gulen and strongly supportive of the ruling AKP. Two
editorials in Monday's publication held that the Syrian crisis has
exposed the coming demise of Turkey's zero problems with
neighbors policy.
