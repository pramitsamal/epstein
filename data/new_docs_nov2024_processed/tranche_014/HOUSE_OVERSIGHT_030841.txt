market thoughts

Our core macro view remains that the global economy
continues to muddle through. We see U.S. growth between
+1.5% and 2.0%, Europe continuing to work its way out of
recession, and emerging economies growing +4%-5%, led
by China as growth moves to a more sustainable trend-like
+7%-8%. Global growth next year should be somewhere
between +2.5% and 3%.

China has just gone through a major political transition. We
expect the new Government to focus on reform initiatives
and inward investment. As my team in Hong Kong
continues to remind me, 7% growth feels pretty good.
There simply isn’t the sense of concern or urgency in
China as there has been outside the country around a
Chinese hard landing. It’s a domestic economy that is
maturing, which is exactly what we expect to see ahead.

With the U.S. election behind us, we believe there should be
little doubt across markets that until inflation becomes a
meaningful concern, central banks will continue to make
holding cash and core bonds frustrating for investors—slowly
pushing investors to take on incremental risk across markets.
But like deleveraging, increased risk taking needs to bea
process, not an event.

Fundamentals matter

I’m a pragmatist in life and as an investor, especially when
measuring and trying to understand risk. My team is very
much macro driven, and | believe in fundamentals (as a
parent, | have to). | like to have a view on both the upside
and downside of an investment. My favorite investment
ratio is 2:1, when thinking about the potential upside-
relative-to-downside, and those investments are hard to
find. Credit has been one of them.

| recently challenged our quantitative research and analytics
team to help me think about the benefits and the risk in
portfolio diversification. We continue to have significant
investment tilts across our portfolios, and | wanted to make
sure we weren't taking on additional risk because of a lack of
diversification. My intuition is that there is far less benefit
today than there has been traditionally in a set-it and forget-it
approach to asset allocation (something we don’t practice).
Let me also add that there is a tremendous difference
between an investor who is less diversified and one who is out
of the market, which continues to be painful for many
investors still on the sidelines.

The team looked back to 1991 at the correlation between
assets across world equity, bond, commodity and foreign
exchange markets. What we found is that correlation across
risk assets has been particularly high since the 2008
financial crisis. You get less benefit owning a little bit of
everything and a great deal more reward for being

disciplined and investing only where you see the most
value. What was even more interesting is that while some of
this is obviously cyclical, there appears to be a structural
pattern here as well.

Why is this relevant? Because it helps explain why we’ve
been comfortable barbelling the risk we’ve taken across
portfolios this year with a significant overweight to credit
markets; it’s allowed us to own less equities for similar
returns. Effectively, we’ve been able to take normal
levels of risk in portfolios but focus on the higher
certainty of those returns coming from yield rather than
more volatile equity price appreciation.

We still see fundamental value in our credit allocations, but
the return ahead is going to be driven by yield or the coupon,
not by bond price appreciation. I’m going to argue that it
places us right where we should be in the deleveraging and
global recovery cycle. It’s time to revisit the balance of how
we are taking risk in portfolios. If we want to achieve similar
portfolio returns next year, we'll need to take more
directional risk where we see value across global markets.
