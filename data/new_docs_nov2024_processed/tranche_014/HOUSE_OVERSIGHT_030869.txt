After just three weeks on the job, President Donald Trump is reportedly frustrated with the realities of trying to
run the U.S. government the way he manages his family-owned business.

Politico interviewed nearly two dozen people who have spent time with the former real estate developer and
reality TV star since his inauguration — and they said Trump’s “mood has careened between surprise and anger
as he’s faced the predictable realities of governing,” according to the report.

“The interviews paint a picture of a powder-keg of a workplace where job duties are unclear, morale among
some is low, factionalism is rampant and exhaustion is running high,” Politico reported. ‘““Two visitors to the
White House last week said they were struck by how tired the staff looks.”

Trump would like to shake up his White House staff less than a month into the job but knows it’s too soon, the
website reported, and aides joke that the president would like to spend even more time golfing at his Mar-A-

Lago resort.

Sources close to Trump said he’s infuriated by the profusion of leaks revealing his confrontational phone calls
with world leaders and the herky-jerky inner workings of the White House.

The White House has launched an investigation of those leaks that appears to be focused on the National
Security Council, based on the Politico report.

NSC staffers have been instructed to cooperate with the inquiry, and the administration may tighten the inner
circle of aides who have access to the calls and their transcripts, the website reported.

A culture of fear and paranoia is developing, pitting the president and his allies against career NSC staff
assigned from other agencies.
