Broward Probe: 302 Reasons Not To Talk To The FBI |

Guest Columnist

Actually, there are not 302 reasons. There is but one and it is called in federal court The 302. It
could screw the innocent and the unwary.

The newspapers and Browardbeat.com make clear that the Federal investigations that led to the arrests
of County Commissioner Josephus Eggleston, former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman and
School Board member Bev Gallagher are just beginning.

The FBI will be interviewing everyone from County Administrator Bertha Henry to bus drivers about
anything and everything.

They are looking for scalps.

I suspect that if the average person thought about it, he would assume that when the FBI comes calling,
like Joe Friday from DRAGNET, they want the facts and nothing but the facts. Equally important
they want an accurate record of that interview so they bring a court reporter or at-the very least a tape
recorder.

The average person would be wrong.

Agents bring a pencil and pad to take notes. They then prepare a summary of the interview called a
m3? Report. : s

If you are called as a witness at trial, prior to testifying, you will be given a copy of Your 302 to -
review. It is a record of what the FBI insists you said at your previous meeting.

If your interview lasted more than thirty seconds, it is guaranteed’you will find numerous discrepancies.
Some of them will be insignificant; some of them could be material.

Ask two people to listen to you in a discussion about a traffic accident and then write a summary. It is a
guaranteed they will have differences with each other as well as with you, the witness.
