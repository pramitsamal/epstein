George Soros is betting big on gold.

As Bill reported yesterday, the billionaire speculator cut his

firm’s investments in U.S. stocks by more than one-third.

Soros has also disclosed a new stake in the world’s biggest

gold miner, Barrick Gold (ABX).

Soros Fund Management, his investment vehicle, bought a 1.7% of Barrick.

This makes it Soros’ biggest listed holding.

As today’s chart shows, Barrick has skyrocketed so far in 2016.

The company’s stock is up a jaw-dropping 156% year to date.
