influence on Mr Modi’s policies. For example over the weekend BJP
spokesmen have been saying that the party still intends to reverse an
existing policy that would allow foreign investors to open supermarkets in
larger cities, and even then only under limited circumstances.

Mr Modi would be wiser to downplay the influence of both sorts of
nationalists. To sustain confidence that he can get the economy growing
faster will require pulling off some difficult feats, not least attracting more
foreign capital into a host of industries which could include insurance,
banking, defence and many parts of infrastructure. He needs to send a
clear message, as he picks ministers and begins to offer policy, that India
aspires to become strong on the back of economic growth, more
international trade, deeper global engagement—and not by promoting
nationalist tendencies at home. He has a decent record of reaching out to
other countries, notably Japan, in his time as chief minister of Gujarat.
Since his victory on May 16th he has fielded calls from Barack Obama,
David Cameron and a host of other global well-wishers eager to engage
India internationally. Mr Obama for example made clear that India’s
prime minister would be welcome to visit the United States. The
Americans in particular want a decisive break from an earlier period, when
interaction with Mr Modi concerned his record in handling communal
violence in his state in 2002. Mr Modi in other words, by winning so
emphatically on May 16th, appears both to have made history and escaped
it. That is no mean feat at all.
