I have been called in to help on a big NYT investigation into how low oil prices have been
effecting the personal finances of royal family in Saudi Arabia. Obviously they called in much

Maybe some people to talk to?

I would think its more than cutting down on yachts and private planes or selling real estate in
Paris, Istanbul, London.

Any thoughts?

PS: does my story on Abraaj get me a meeting with Gates next time he is in town:)
