Mr. Weinberg

| was referred to you by Alan Dershowitz, who told me you're Jeffrey Epstein's attorney.

If this is the case, | was hoping to reach him through you to see if he'd be willing to speak on the record about
his ties - or previous ties - to both the Clintons and Donald Trump?

Would you be able to arrange a call or email exchange this week?

Thanks for your consideration.
