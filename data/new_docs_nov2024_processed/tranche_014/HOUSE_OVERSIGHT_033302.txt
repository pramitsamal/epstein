One’s 43. The presidential jet is also slightly faster with a range of about
6,800 nautical miles compared to 4,100 for a 757. A VC-25A can also be
refuelled in mid-air by a tanker, extending its range even further.

The two presidential planes cost $325 million each and their cost of operation
comes to $179,750 per hour. The hourly cost of operation for a standard 757
is just over $8,000 by comparison, though the taxpayer will pick up the higher
bill for Air Force One. All that bling certainly inflated the cost of Trump Force
One but Air Force One is expensive because it’s packed with equipment and
facilities to keep the president and his or her entourage safe at all times.
There is a hospital onboard, electronic countermeasures and heavy shielding
to afford protection in the event of an electromagnetic pulse during a nuclear
attack. All in all, if Trump does end up travelling regularly on Air Force One,
he probably won't regret trading in his gold seatbelt buckle for the presidential
suite on one of the most sophisticated airliners in the world.
