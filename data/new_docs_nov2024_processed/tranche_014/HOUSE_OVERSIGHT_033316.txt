Transcript: Phone call between President

Trump and journalist Bob Woodward
Aaron Blake

President Trump and Bob Woodward discuss Woodward’s new book, “Fear,” before its
publication. (The Washington Post)

Bob Woodward, an associate editor at The Washington Post, sought an interview with

President Trump as he was writing “Fear,” a book about Trump’s presidency. Trump
called Woodward in early August, after the manuscript had been completed, to say he

wanted to participate.

Over the course of 11-plus minutes, Trump repeatedly claimed his White House staff

hadn’t informed him of Woodward’s interview request — despite also admitting Sen.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) had told him Woodward wanted to talk. He also started the
phone call by saying Woodward had “always been fair” to him, but by the end he said
the book would be “inaccurate.”

Trump: Hello, Bob.

BW: President Trump, how are you?

Trump: How are you? How are you doing? Okay?

BW: Real well. I’m turning on my tape recorder, with your permission.
Trump: Oh, that’s okay. That’s okay. I don’t mind that at all.

BW: I’m sorry we missed the opportunity to talk for the book.

Trump: Well, I just spoke with Kellyanne [Conway] and she asked me if I gota call. I
never got a call. I never got a message. Who did you ask about speaking to me?
