bribe payor in this situation “could have turned his back and
walked away,” in the oil rig example, “he could not.” 175
Businesses operating in high-risk countries may face
real threats of violence or harm to their employees, and
payments made in response to imminent threats to health
or safety do not violate the FCPA. 176 If such a situation
arises, and to ensure the safety of its employees, companies
should immediately contact the appropriate U.S. embassy
for assistance.
Principles of Corporate Liability for
Anti-Bribery Violations
General principles of corporate liability apply to the
FCPA. Thus, a company is liable when its directors, officers,
employees, or agents, acting within the scope of their employment,
commit FCPA violations intended, at least in part, to
benefit the company. 177 Similarly, just as with any other statute,
DOJ and SEC look to principles of parent-subsidiary
and successor liability in evaluating corporate liability.
Parent-Subsidiary Liability
There are two ways in which a parent company may
be liable for bribes paid by its subsidiary. First, a parent may
have participated sufficiently in the activity to be directly
liable for the conduct—as, for example, when it directed its
subsidiary’s misconduct or otherwise directly participated
in the bribe scheme.
Second, a parent may be liable for its subsidiary’s conduct
under traditional agency principles. The fundamental
characteristic of agency is control. 178 Accordingly, DOJ and
SEC evaluate the parent’s control—including the parent’s
knowledge and direction of the subsidiary’s actions, both
generally and in the context of the specific transaction—
when evaluating whether a subsidiary is an agent of the parent.
Although the formal relationship between the parent
and subsidiary is important in this analysis, so are the practical
realities of how the parent and subsidiary actually interact.
If an agency relationship exists, a subsidiary’s actions
and knowledge are imputed to its parent. 179 Moreover,
under traditional principles of respondeat superior, a company
is liable for the acts of its agents, including its employees,
undertaken within the scope of their employment and
intended, at least in part, to benefit the company. 180 Thus,
if an agency relationship exists between a parent and a
subsidiary, the parent is liable for bribery committed by
the subsidiary’s employees. For example, SEC brought an
administrative action against a parent for bribes paid by the
president of its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. In that
matter, the subsidiary’s president reported directly to the
CEO of the parent issuer, and the issuer routinely identified
27
the president as a member of its senior management in its
annual filing with SEC and in annual reports. Additionally,
the parent’s legal department approved the retention of the
third-party agent through whom the bribes were arranged
despite a lack of documented due diligence and an agency
agreement that violated corporate policy; also, an official of
the parent approved one of the payments to the third-party
agent. 181 Under these circumstances, the parent company
had sufficient knowledge and control of its subsidiary’s
actions to be liable under the FCPA.
Successor Liability
Companies acquire a host of liabilities when they
merge with or acquire another company, including those arising
out of contracts, torts, regulations, and statutes. As a general
legal matter, when a company merges with or acquires
another company, the successor company assumes the predecessor
company’s liabilities. 182 Successor liability is an integral
component of corporate law and, among other things, prevents
companies from avoiding liability by reorganizing. 183
Successor liability applies to all kinds of civil and criminal
liabilities, 184 and FCPA violations are no exception. Whether
successor liability applies to a particular corporate transaction
depends on the facts and the applicable state, federal,
and foreign law. Successor liability does not, however, create
liability where none existed before. For example, if an issuer
were to acquire a foreign company that was not previously
subject to the FCPA’s jurisdiction, the mere acquisition of
that foreign company would not retroactively create FCPA
liability for the acquiring issuer.
DOJ and SEC encourage companies to conduct preacquisition
due diligence and improve compliance programs
and internal controls after acquisition for a variety
of reasons. First, due diligence helps an acquiring company
to accurately value the target company. Contracts obtained
through bribes may be legally unenforceable, business
obtained illegally may be lost when bribe payments are
stopped, there may be liability for prior illegal conduct, and
the prior corrupt acts may harm the acquiring company’s
reputation and future business prospects. Identifying these
issues before an acquisition allows companies to better
chapter 2
The FCPA:
Anti-Bribery Provisions
evaluate any potential post-acquisition liability and thus
properly assess the target’s value. 185 Second, due diligence
reduces the risk that the acquired company will continue to
pay bribes. Proper pre-acquisition due diligence can identify
business and regional risks and can also lay the foundation
for a swift and successful post-acquisition integration
into the acquiring company’s corporate control and compliance
environment. Third, the consequences of potential
violations uncovered through due diligence can be handled
by the parties in an orderly and efficient manner through
negotiation of the costs and responsibilities for the investigation
and remediation. Finally, comprehensive due diligence
demonstrates a genuine commitment to uncovering
and preventing FCPA violations.
In a significant number of instances, DOJ and
SEC have declined to take action against companies
that voluntarily disclosed and remediated conduct
and cooperated with DOJ and SEC in the merger and
acquisition context. 186 And DOJ and SEC have only
taken action against successor companies in limited circumstances,
generally in cases involving egregious and
sustained violations or where the successor company
directly participated in the violations or failed to stop the
misconduct from continuing after the acquisition. In one
case, a U.S.-based issuer was charged with books and records
and internal controls violations for continuing a kickback
scheme originated by its predecessor. 187 Another recent case
involved a merger between two tobacco leaf merchants,
where prior to the merger each company committed
FCPA violations through its foreign subsidiaries, involving
multiple countries over the course of many years. At each
company, the bribes were directed by the parent company’s
senior management. The two issuers then merged to form
a new public company. Under these circumstances—the
merger of two public companies that had each engaged in
28
Practical Tips to Reduce FCPA Risk in Mergers and Acquisitions
Companies pursuing mergers or acquisitions can take certain steps to identify and potentially reduce FCPA risks:
• M&A Opinion Procedure Release Requests: One option is to seek an opinion from DOJ in anticipation of a
potential acquisition, such as occurred with Opinion Release 08-02 That case involved special circumstances,
namely, severely limited pre-acquisition due diligence available to the potential acquiring company, and, because
it was an opinion release (i e , providing certain assurances by DOJ concerning prospective conduct), it necessarily
imposed demanding standards and prescriptive timeframes in return for specific assurances from DOJ, which
SEC, as a matter of discretion, also honors Thus, obtaining an opinion from DOJ can be a good way to address
specific due diligence challenges, but, because of the nature of such an opinion, it will likely contain more stringent
requirements than may be necessary in all circumstances
• M&A Risk-Based FCPA Due Diligence and Disclosure: As a practical matter, most acquisitions will typically not
require the type of prospective assurances contained in an opinion from DOJ DOJ and SEC encourage companies
engaging in mergers and acquisitions to: (1) conduct thorough risk-based FCPA and anti-corruption due diligence
on potential new business acquisitions; (2) ensure that the acquiring company’s code of conduct and compliance
policies and procedures regarding the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws apply as quickly as is practicable to
newly acquired businesses or merged entities; (3) train the directors, officers, and employees of newly acquired
businesses or merged entities, and when appropriate, train agents and business partners, on the FCPA and other
relevant anti-corruption laws and the company’s code of conduct and compliance policies and procedures; (4)
conduct an FCPA-specific audit of all newly acquired or merged businesses as quickly as practicable; and (5) disclose
any corrupt payments discovered as part of its due diligence of newly acquired entities or merged entities DOJ
and SEC will give meaningful credit to companies who undertake these actions, and, in appropriate circumstances,
DOJ and SEC may consequently decline to bring enforcement actions
bribery—both the new entity and the foreign subsidiaries
were liable under the FCPA. The new parent entered into
a non-prosecution agreement with DOJ and settled a civil
action with SEC, while the company’s subsidiaries, which
also merged, pleaded guilty. 188
More often, DOJ and SEC have pursued enforcement
actions against the predecessor company (rather
than the acquiring company), particularly when the
acquiring company uncovered and timely remedied the
violations or when the government’s investigation of
the predecessor company preceded the acquisition. In
one such case, an Ohio-based health care company’s due
diligence of an acquisition target uncovered FCPA violations
by the target’s subsidiary, and, before the merger
was completed, the subsidiary’s violations were disclosed
to DOJ and SEC. The subsidiary pleaded guilty and
paid a $2 million criminal fine, 189 the acquisition target
settled with SEC and paid a $500,000 civil penalty, 190
and no successor liability was sought against the acquiring
entity. In another case, a Pennsylvania-based issuer
that supplied heating and air conditioning products and
services was subject to an ongoing investigation by DOJ
and SEC at the time that it was acquired; DOJ and SEC
resolved enforcement actions only against the predecessor
company, which had by that time become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the successor company. 191
DOJ and SEC have also brought actions only against a
predecessor company where its FCPA violations are discovered
after acquisition. For example, when a Florida-based
U.S. company discovered in post-acquisition due diligence
that the telecommunications company (a domestic concern)
it had acquired had engaged in foreign bribery, the
successor company disclosed the FCPA violations to DOJ.
It then conducted an internal investigation, cooperated
fully with DOJ, and took appropriate remedial action—
including terminating senior management at the acquired
29
company. No enforcement action was taken against the successor,
but the predecessor company pleaded guilty to one
count of violating the FCPA and agreed to pay a $2 million
fine. 192 Later, four executives from the predecessor company
were convicted of FCPA violations, three of whom received
terms of imprisonment. 193
On occasion, when an enforcement action has
been taken against a predecessor company, the successor
seeks assurances that it will not be subject to a future
enforcement action. In one such case, a Dutch predecessor
resolved FCPA charges with DOJ through a deferred
prosecution agreement. 194 While both the predecessor
and successor signed the agreement, which included a
commitment to ongoing cooperation and an improved
compliance program, only the predecessor company was
charged; in signing the agreement, the successor company
gained the certainty of conditional release from criminal
liability, even though it was not being pursued for FCPA
violations. 195 In another case, after a Connecticut-based
company uncovered FCPA violations by a California
company it sought to acquire, both companies voluntarily
disclosed the conduct to DOJ and SEC. 196 The predecessor
company resolved its criminal liability through a
non-prosecution agreement with DOJ that included an
$800,000 monetary penalty and also settled with SEC,
paying a total of $1.1 million in disgorgement, pre-judgment
interest, and civil penalties. The successor company
proceeded with the acquisition and separately entered
into a non-prosecution agreement with DOJ in which it
agreed, among other things, to ensure full performance of
the predecessor company’s non-prosecution agreement.
This agreement provided certainty to the successor concerning
its FCPA liability. 197
Importantly, a successor company’s voluntary disclosure,
appropriate due diligence, and implementation of an
effective compliance program may also decrease the likelihood
of an enforcement action regarding an acquired company’s
post-acquisition conduct when pre-acquisition due
diligence is not possible. 198

The FCPA:
Anti-Bribery Provisions
30
Hypothetical: Successor Liability Where Acquired Company Was Not Previously
Subject to the FCPA
Company A is a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in the United States and whose shares are listed on
a national U.S. exchange. Company A is considering acquiring Foreign Company, which is not an issuer or a domestic
concern. Foreign Company takes no actions within the United States that would make it subject to territorial jurisdiction.
Company A’s proposed acquisition would make Foreign Company a subsidiary of Company A.
Scenario 1:
Prior to acquiring Foreign Company, Company A engages in extensive due diligence of Foreign Company, including: (1)
having its legal, accounting, and compliance departments review Foreign Company’s sales and financial data, its customer
contracts, and its third-party and distributor agreements; (2) performing a risk-based analysis of Foreign Company’s customer
base; (3) performing an audit of selected transactions engaged in by Foreign Company; and (4) engaging in discussions
with Foreign Company’s general counsel, vice president of sales, and head of internal audit regarding all corruption risks,
compliance efforts, and any other corruption-related issues that have surfaced at Foreign Company over the past ten years.
This due diligence aims to determine whether Foreign Company has appropriate anti-corruption and compliance policies
in place, whether Foreign Company’s employees have been adequately trained regarding those policies, how Foreign
Company ensures that those policies are followed, and what remedial actions are taken if the policies are violated.
During the course of its due diligence, Company A learns that Foreign Company has made several potentially
improper payments in the form of an inflated commission to a third-party agent in connection with a government contract
with Foreign Country. Immediately after the acquisition, Company A discloses the conduct to DOJ and SEC, suspends
and terminates those employees and the third-party agent responsible for the payments, and makes certain that the
illegal payments have stopped. It also quickly integrates Foreign Company into Company A’s own robust internal controls,
including its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required online
and in-person training in the local language. Company A also requires Foreign Company’s third-party distributors and other
agents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anticorruption
representations and warranties and audit rights.
Based on these facts, could DOJ or SEC prosecute Company A?
No. Although DOJ and SEC have jurisdiction over Company A because it is an issuer, neither could pursue Company
A for conduct that occurred prior to its acquisition of Foreign Company. As Foreign Company was neither an issuer nor a
domestic concern and was not subject to U.S. territorial jurisdiction, DOJ and SEC have no jurisdiction over its pre-acquisition
misconduct. The acquisition of a company does not create jurisdiction where none existed before.
Importantly, Company A’s extensive pre-acquisition due diligence allowed it to identify and halt the corruption. As
there was no continuing misconduct post-acquisition, the FCPA was not violated.
Scenario 2:
Company A performs only minimal and pro forma pre-acquisition due diligence. It does not conduct a risk-based
analysis, and its review of Foreign Company’s data, contracts, and third-party and distributor agreements is cursory.
Company A acquires Foreign Company and makes it a wholly owned subsidiary. Although Company A circulates its
compliance policies to all new personnel after the acquisition, it does not translate the compliance policies into the local
language or train its new personnel or third-party agents on anti-corruption issues.
A few months after the acquisition, an employee in Company A’s international sales office (Sales Employee) learns
from a legacy Foreign Company employee that for years the government contract that generated most of Foreign
Company’s revenues depended on inflated commissions to a third-party agent “to make the right person happy at Foreign
Government Agency.” Sales Employee is told that unless the payments continue the business will likely be lost, which
would mean that Company A’s new acquisition would quickly become a financial failure. The payments continue for two
(cont’d)
31
chapter 2
The FCPA:
Anti-Bribery Provisions
years after the acquisition. After another employee of Company A reports the long-running bribe scheme to a director at
Foreign Government Agency, Company A stops the payments and DOJ and SEC investigate.
Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC charge Company A?
Yes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company A in similar circumstances. Any charges would not,
however, be premised upon successor liability, but rather on Company A’s post-acquisition bribe payments, which
themselves created criminal and civil liability for Company A.
Scenario 3:
Under local law, Company A’s ability to conduct pre-acquisition due diligence on Foreign Company is limited. In the
due diligence it does conduct, Company A determines that Foreign Company is doing business in high-risk countries
and in high-risk industries but finds no red flags specific to Foreign Company’s operations. Post-acquisition, Company
A conducts extensive due diligence and determines that Foreign Company had paid bribes to officials with Foreign
Government Agency. Company A takes prompt action to remediate the problem, including following the measures set
forth in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02. Among other actions, it voluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and
SEC, ensures all bribes are immediately stopped, takes remedial action against all parties involved in the corruption, and
quickly incorporates Foreign Company into a robust compliance program and Company A’s other internal controls.
Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute Company A?
DOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances Companies can follow
the measures set forth in Opinion Procedure Release No 08-02, or seek their own opinions, where adequate pre-acquisition
due diligence is not possible
Hypothetical: Successor Liability Where Acquired Company Was Already Subject to
the FCPA
Both Company A and Company B are Delaware corporations with their principal offices in the United States Both
companies’ shares are listed on a national U S exchange
Scenario 1:
Company A is considering acquiring several of Company B’s business lines. Prior to the acquisition, Company A engages
in extensive due diligence, including: (1) having its legal, accounting, and compliance departments review Company B’s
sales and financial data, its customer contracts, and its third-party and distributor agreements; (2) performing a risk-based
analysis of Company B’s customer base; (3) performing an audit of selected transactions engaged in by Company B; and
(4) engaging in discussions with Company B’s general counsel, vice president of sales, and head of internal audit regarding
all corruption risks, compliance efforts, and any other major corruption-related issues that have surfaced at Company B
over the past ten years. This due diligence aims to determine whether Company B has appropriate anti-corruption and
compliance policies in place, whether Company B’s employees have been adequately trained regarding those policies,
how Company B ensures that those policies are followed, and what remedial actions are taken if the policies are violated.
During the course of its due diligence, Company A learns that Company B has made several potentially improper
payments in connection with a government contract with Foreign Country. As a condition of the acquisition, Company A
requires Company B to disclose the misconduct to the government. Company A makes certain that the illegal payments
(cont’d)
32
have stopped and quickly integrates Company B’s business lines into Company A’s own robust internal controls, including
its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required online and inperson
training in the local language. Company A also requires Company B’s third-party distributors and other agents to
sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anti-corruption
representations and warranties and audit rights.
Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?
DOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances. DOJ and SEC
encourage companies like Company A to conduct extensive FCPA due diligence. By uncovering the corruption, Company
A put itself in a favorable position, and, because the corrupt payments have stopped, Company A has no continuing
liability. Whether DOJ and SEC might charge Company B depends on facts and circumstances beyond the scope of this
hypothetical. DOJ would consider its Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations and SEC would consider
the factors contained in the Seaboard Report, both of which are discussed in Chapter 5. In general, the more egregious
and long-standing the corruption, the more likely it is that DOJ and SEC would prosecute Company B. In certain limited
circumstances, DOJ and SEC have in the past declined to bring charges against acquired companies, recognizing that
acquiring companies may bear much of the reputational damage and costs associated with such charges.
Scenario 2:
Company A plans to acquire Company B Although, as in Scenario 1, Company A conducts extensive due diligence, it
does not uncover the bribery until after the acquisition Company A then makes certain that the illegal payments stop and
voluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and SEC It quickly integrates Company B into Company A’s own robust internal
controls, including its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required
online and in-person training in the local language Company A also requires Company B’s third-party distributors and other
agents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anticorruption
representations and warranties and audit rights
Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?
Absent unusual circumstances not contemplated by this hypothetical, DOJ and SEC are unlikely to prosecute
Company A for the pre-acquisition misconduct of Company B, provided that Company B still exists in a form that would
allow it to be prosecuted separately (e.g., Company B is a subsidiary of Company A). DOJ and SEC understand that no
due diligence is perfect and that society benefits when companies with strong compliance programs acquire and improve
companies with weak ones. At the same time, however, neither the liability for corruption—nor the harms caused by it—
are eliminated when one company acquires another. Whether DOJ and SEC will pursue a case against Company B (or, in
unusual circumstances, Company A) will depend on consideration of all the factors in the Principles of Federal Prosecution
of Business Organizations and the Seaboard Report, respectively.
Scenario 3:
Company A merges with Company B, which is in the same line of business and interacts with the same Foreign
Government customers, and forms Company C Due diligence before the merger reveals that both Company A and
Company B have been engaging in similar bribery In both cases, the bribery was extensive and known by high-level
management within the companies
Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?
Yes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company C on the basis of successor liability. Company C is a
combination of two companies that both violated the FCPA, and their merger does not eliminate their liability. In addition,
since Company C is an ongoing concern, DOJ and SEC may impose a monitorship to ensure that the bribery has ceased
and a compliance program is developed to prevent future misconduct.
33
Additional Principles of Criminal
Liability for Anti-Bribery Violations:
Aiding and Abetting and Conspiracy
Under federal law, individuals or companies that aid
or abet a crime, including an FCPA violation, are as guilty as
if they had directly committed the offense themselves. The
aiding and abetting statute provides that whoever “commits
an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels,
commands, induces or procures its commission,” or “willfully
causes an act to be done which if directly performed
by him or another would be an offense against the United
States,” is punishable as a principal. 199 Aiding and abetting is
not an independent crime, and the government must prove
that an underlying FCPA violation was committed. 200
Individuals and companies, including foreign nationals
and companies, may also be liable for conspiring to
violate the FCPA—i.e., for agreeing to commit an FCPA
violation—even if they are not, or could not be, independently
charged with a substantive FCPA violation. For
instance, a foreign, non-issuer company could be convicted
of conspiring with a domestic concern to violate the FCPA.
Under certain circumstances, it could also be held liable
for the domestic concern’s substantive FCPA violations
under Pinkerton v. United States, which imposes liability on
a defendant for reasonably foreseeable crimes committed
by a co-conspirator in furtherance of a conspiracy that the
defendant joined. 201
A foreign company or individual may be held liable
for aiding and abetting an FCPA violation or for conspiring
to violate the FCPA, even if the foreign company or individual
did not take any act in furtherance of the corrupt
payment while in the territory of the United States. In conspiracy
cases, the United States generally has jurisdiction
over all the conspirators where at least one conspirator is
an issuer, domestic concern, or commits a reasonably foreseeable
overt act within the United States. 202 For example,
if a foreign company or individual conspires to violate the
FCPA with someone who commits an overt act within the
United States, the United States can prosecute the foreign
company or individual for the conspiracy. The same principle
applies to aiding and abetting violations. For instance,
chapter 2
The FCPA:
Anti-Bribery Provisions
even though they took no action in the United States,
Japanese and European companies were charged with conspiring
with and aiding and abetting a domestic concern’s
FCPA violations. 203
Additional Principles of Civil Liability
for Anti-Bribery Violations: Aiding and
Abetting and Causing
Both companies and individuals can be held civilly
liable for aiding and abetting FCPA anti-bribery violations
if they knowingly or recklessly provide substantial assistance
to a violator. 204 Similarly, in the administrative proceeding
context, companies and individuals may be held
liable for causing FCPA violations. 205 This liability extends
to the subsidiaries and agents of U.S. issuers.
In one case, the U.S. subsidiary of a Swiss freight forwarding
company was held civilly liable for paying bribes on
behalf of its customers in several countries. 206 Although the
U.S. subsidiary was not an issuer for purposes of the FCPA,
it was an “agent” of several U.S. issuers. By paying bribes on
behalf of its issuers’ customers, the subsidiary both directly
violated and aided and abetted the issuers’ FCPA violations.
What Is the Applicable Statute of
Limitations?
Statute of Limitations in Criminal Cases
The FCPA’s anti-bribery and accounting provisions
do not specify a statute of limitations for criminal actions.
Accordingly, the general five-year limitations period set
forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3282 applies to substantive criminal
violations of the Act. 207
In cases involving FCPA conspiracies, the government
may be able to reach conduct occurring before the
five-year limitations period applicable to conspiracies
34
under 18 U.S.C. § 371. For conspiracy offenses, the government
generally need prove only that one act in furtherance
of the conspiracy occurred during the limitations period,
thus enabling the government to prosecute bribes paid or
accounting violations occurring more than five years prior
to the filing of formal charges. 208
There are at least two ways in which the applicable
limitations period is commonly extended. First, companies
or individuals cooperating with DOJ may enter into
a tolling agreement that voluntarily extends the limitations
period. Second, under 18 U.S.C. § 3292, the government
may seek a court order suspending the statute of limitations
posed in a criminal case for up to three years in order to
obtain evidence from foreign countries. Generally, the suspension
period begins when the official request is made by
the U.S. government to the foreign authority and ends on
the date on which the foreign authority takes final action
on the request. 209
Statute of Limitations in Civil Actions
In civil cases brought by SEC, the statute of limitations
is set by 28 U.S.C. § 2462, which provides for a fiveyear
limitation on any “suit or proceeding for the enforcement
of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture.” The five-year
period begins to run “when the claim first accrued.” The
five-year limitations period applies to SEC actions seeking
civil penalties, but it does not prevent SEC from
seeking equitable remedies, such as an injunction or the
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, for conduct pre-dating
the five-year period. In cases against individuals who are
not residents of the United States, the statute is tolled for
any period when the defendants are not “found within the
United States in order that proper service may be made
thereon.” 210 Furthermore, companies or individuals cooperating
with SEC may enter into tolling agreements that
voluntarily extend the limitations period.

Anti-Bribery Provisions

chapter 3
The FCPA:
Accounting Provisions
THE FCPA: ACCOUNTING
PROVISIONS
In addition to the anti-bribery provisions, the FCPA contains accounting provisions
applicable to public companies. The FCPA’s accounting provisions operate
in tandem with the anti-bribery provisions 211 and prohibit off-the-books
accounting. Company management and investors rely on a company’s financial
statements and internal accounting controls to ensure transparency in the financial
health of the business, the risks undertaken, and the transactions between
the company and its customers and business partners. The accounting provisions
are designed to “strengthen the accuracy of the corporate books and
records and the reliability of the audit process which constitute the foundations
of our system of corporate disclosure.” 212
The accounting provisions consist of two primary
components. First, under the “books and records” provision,
issuers must make and keep books, records, and
accounts that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect an issuer’s transactions and dispositions of an issuer’s
assets. 213 Second, under the “internal controls” provision,
issuers must devise and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to assure management’s control,
authority, and responsibility over the firm’s assets. 214
These components, and other aspects of the accounting
provisions, are discussed in greater detail below.
Although the accounting provisions were originally
enacted as part of the FCPA, they do not apply only to bribery-related
violations. Rather, the accounting provisions
ensure that all public companies account for all of their
assets and liabilities accurately and in reasonable detail,
and they form the backbone for most accounting fraud and
issuer disclosure cases brought by DOJ and SEC. 215
38
In the past, “corporate bribery has
been concealed by the falsification of
corporate books and records” and the
accounting provisions “remove[] this
avenue of coverup.”
Senate Report No. 95-114, at 3 (1977)
What Is Covered by the Accounting
Provisions?
Books and Records Provision
Bribes, both foreign and domestic, are often mischaracterized
in companies’ books and records. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of
the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A)), commonly
called the “books and records” provision, requires issuers
to “make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.” 216 The “in
reasonable detail” qualification was adopted by Congress
“in light of the concern that such a standard, if unqualified,
might connote a degree of exactitude and precision which
is unrealistic.” 217 The addition of this phrase was intended
to make clear “that the issuer’s records should reflect transactions
in conformity with accepted methods of recording
economic events and effectively prevent off-the-books slush
funds and payments of bribes.” 218
The term “reasonable detail” is defined in the statute
as the level of detail that would “satisfy prudent officials in
the conduct of their own affairs.” 219 Thus, as Congress noted
when it adopted this definition, “[t]he concept of reasonableness
of necessity contemplates the weighing of a number of
relevant factors, including the costs of compliance.” 220
Although the standard is one of reasonable detail,
it is never appropriate to mischaracterize transactions in a
company’s books and records. 221 Bribes are often concealed
under the guise of legitimate payments, such as commissions
or consulting fees.
In instances where all the elements of a violation of
the anti-bribery provisions are not met—where, for example,
there was no use of interstate commerce—companies
nonetheless may be liable if the improper payments are inaccurately
recorded. Consistent with the FCPA’s approach
to prohibiting payments of any value that are made with a
corrupt purpose, there is no materiality threshold under the
books and records provision. In combination with the internal
controls provision, the requirement that issuers maintain
books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the
corporation’s transactions “assure[s], among other things,
that the assets of the issuer are used for proper corporate
purpose[s].” 222 As with the anti-bribery provisions, DOJ’s
and SEC’s enforcement of the books and records provision
has typically involved misreporting of either large bribe payments
or widespread inaccurate recording of smaller payments
made as part of a systemic pattern of bribery.
Bribes Have Been Mischaracterized As:
• Commissions or Royalties
• Consulting Fees
• Sales and Marketing Expenses
• Scientific Incentives or Studies
• Travel and Entertainment Expenses
• Rebates or Discounts
• After Sales Service Fees
• Miscellaneous Expenses
• Petty Cash Withdrawals
• Free Goods
• Intercompany Accounts
• Supplier / Vendor Payments
• Write-offs
• “Customs Intervention” Payments
39
Internal Controls Provision
The payment of bribes often occurs in companies that
have weak internal control environments. Internal controls
over financial reporting are the processes used by companies
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements. They include various components, such as: a
control environment that covers the tone set by the organization
regarding integrity and ethics; risk assessments; control
activities that cover policies and procedures designed
to ensure that management directives are carried out (e.g.,
approvals, authorizations, reconciliations, and segregation
of duties); information and communication; and monitoring.
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
§ 78m(b)(2)(B)), commonly called the “internal controls”
provision, requires issuers to:
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
that—
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s
general or specific authorization;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles or any
other criteria applicable to such statements, and (II)
to maintain accountability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management’s general or specific authorization;
and
(iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals
and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences …. 223
chapter 3
The FCPA:
Accounting Provisions
An effective compliance program is a critical component
of an issuer’s internal controls. Fundamentally,
the design of a company’s internal controls must take into
account the operational realities and risks attendant to the
company’s business, such as: the nature of its products or
services; how the products or services get to market; the
nature of its work force; the degree of regulation; the extent
of its government interaction; and the degree to which it
has operations in countries with a high risk of corruption. A
company’s compliance program should be tailored to these
differences. Businesses whose operations expose them to a
high risk of corruption will necessarily devise and employ
different internal controls than businesses that have a lesser
exposure to corruption, just as a financial services company
would be expected to devise and employ different internal
controls than a manufacturer.
A 2008 case against a German manufacturer of industrial
and consumer products illustrates a systemic internal
controls problem involving bribery that was unprecedented
in scale and geographic reach. From 2001 to 2007, the company
created elaborate payment schemes—including slush
Like the “reasonable detail” requirement in the
books and records provision, the Act defines “reasonable
assurances” as “such level of detail and degree of assurance
as would satisfy prudent officials in the conduct of their
own affairs.” 224
The Act does not specify a particular set of controls
that companies are required to implement. Rather, the
internal controls provision gives companies the flexibility
to develop and maintain a system of controls that is appropriate
to their particular needs and circumstances.
Companies with ineffective internal
controls often face risks of embezzlement
and self-dealing by employees, commercial
bribery, export control problems, and
violations of other U.S. and local laws.
40
funds, off-the-books accounts, and systematic payments to
business consultants and other intermediaries—to facilitate
bribery. Payments were made in ways that obscured their
purpose and the ultimate recipients of the money. In some
cases, employees obtained large amounts of cash from cash
desks and then transported the cash in suitcases across international
borders. Authorizations for some payments were
placed on sticky notes and later removed to avoid any permanent
record. The company made payments totaling approximately
$1.36 billion through various mechanisms, including
$805.5 million as bribes and $554.5 million for unknown
purposes. 225 The company was charged with internal controls
and books and records violations, along with anti-bribery
violations, and paid over $1.6 billion to resolve the case with
authorities in the United States and Germany. 226
The types of internal control failures identified in the
above example exist in many other cases where companies
were charged with internal controls violations. 227 A 2010
case against a multi-national automobile manufacturer
involved bribery that occurred over a long period of time in
multiple countries. 228 In that case, the company used dozens
of ledger accounts, known internally as “internal third
party accounts,” to maintain credit balances for the benefit
of government officials. 229 The accounts were funded
through several bogus pricing mechanisms, such as “price
surcharges,” “price inclusions,” or excessive commissions. 230
The company also used artificial discounts or rebates on
sales contracts to generate the money to pay the bribes. 231
The bribes also were made through phony sales intermediaries
and corrupt business partners, as well as through the
use of cash desks. 232 Sales executives would obtain cash from
the company in amounts as high as hundreds of thousands
of dollars, enabling the company to obscure the purpose
and recipients of the money paid to government officials. 233
In addition to bribery charges, the company was charged
with internal controls and books and records violations.
Good internal controls can prevent not only FCPA
violations, but also other illegal or unethical conduct by the
company, its subsidiaries, and its employees. DOJ and SEC
have repeatedly brought FCPA cases that also involved
other types of misconduct, such as financial fraud, 234
commercial bribery, 235 export controls violations, 236 and
embezzlement or self-dealing by company employees. 237
Potential Reporting and Anti-Fraud Violations
Issuers have reporting obligations under Section
13(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to file
an annual report that contains comprehensive information
about the issuer. Failure to properly disclose material information
about the issuer’s business, including material revenue,
expenses, profits, assets, or liabilities related to bribery
of foreign government officials, may give rise to anti-fraud
and reporting violations under Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of
the Exchange Act.
For example, a California-based technology company
was charged with reporting violations, in addition to violations
of the FCPA’s anti-bribery and accounting provisions,
when its bribery scheme led to material misstatements in its
SEC filings. 238 The company was awarded contracts procured
through bribery of Chinese officials that generated material
revenue and profits. The revenue and profits helped the company
offset losses incurred to develop new products expected
to become the company’s future source of revenue growth.
The company improperly recorded the bribe payments as
sales commission expenses in its books and records.
Companies engaged in bribery may also be engaged
in activity that violates the anti-fraud and reporting provisions.
For example, an oil and gas pipeline company and
its employees engaged in a long-running scheme to use the
company’s petty cash accounts in Nigeria to make a variety
of corrupt payments to Nigerian tax and court officials
using false invoices. 239 The company and its employees also
engaged in a fraudulent scheme to minimize the company’s
tax obligations in Bolivia by using false invoices to claim
false offsets to its value-added tax obligations. The scheme
resulted in material overstatements of the company’s net
income in the company’s financial statements, which violated
the Exchange Act’s anti-fraud and reporting provisions.
Both schemes also violated the books and records
and internal controls provisions.
41
What Are Management’s Other Obligations?
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
In 2002, in response to a series of accounting scandals
involving U.S. companies, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (Sarbanes-Oxley or SOX), 240 which strengthened
the accounting requirements for issuers. All issuers
must comply with Sarbanes-Oxley’s requirements, several
of which have FCPA implications.
SOX Section 302 (15 U.S.C. § 7241)—Responsibility
of Corporate Officers for the Accuracy and Validity of
Corporate Financial Reports
Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that a company’s
“principal officers” (typically the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)) take
responsibility for and certify the integrity of their company’s
financial reports on a quarterly basis. Under Exchange
Act Rule 13a-14, which is commonly called the “SOX certification”
rule, each periodic report filed by an issuer must
include a certification signed by the issuer’s principal executive
officer and principal financial officer that, among other
things, states that: (i) based on the officer’s knowledge, the
report contains no material misstatements or omissions;
(ii) based on the officer’s knowledge, the relevant financial
statements are accurate in all material respects; (iii) internal
controls are properly designed; and (iv) the certifying
officers have disclosed to the issuer’s audit committee and
auditors all significant internal control deficiencies.
SOX Section 404 (15 U.S.C. § 7262)—Reporting
on the State of a Company’s Internal Controls over
Financial Reporting
Sarbanes-Oxley also strengthened a company’s
required disclosures concerning the state of its internal control
over financial reporting. Under Section 404, issuers are
required to present in their annual reports management’s
conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the company’s
internal controls over financial reporting. This statement
must also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls
and procedures. In addition, the company’s independent
chapter 3
The FCPA:
Accounting Provisions
auditor must attest to and report on its assessment of the
effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial
reporting.
As directed by Section 404, SEC has adopted
rules requiring issuers and their independent auditors to
report to the public on the effectiveness of the company’s
internal controls over financial reporting. 241 These
internal controls include those related to illegal acts and
fraud—including acts of bribery—that could result in a
material misstatement of the company’s financial statements.
242 In 2007, SEC issued guidance on controls over
financial reporting. 243
SOX Section 802 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1519 and 1520)—
Criminal Penalties for Altering Documents
Section 802 of Sarbanes-Oxley prohibits altering,
destroying, mutilating, concealing, or falsifying records,
documents, or tangible objects with the intent to obstruct,
impede, or influence a potential or actual federal investigation.
This section also prohibits any accountant from knowingly
and willfully violating the requirement that all audit
or review papers be maintained for a period of five years.
Who Is Covered by the Accounting
Provisions?
Civil Liability for Issuers, Subsidiaries, and Affiliates
The FCPA’s accounting provisions apply to every
issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file
annual or other periodic reports pursuant to Section 15(d)
of the Exchange Act. 244 These provisions apply to any issuer
whose securities trade on a national securities exchange in
the United States, including foreign issuers with exchangetraded
American Depository Receipts. 245 They also apply
42
to companies whose stock trades in the over-the-counter
market in the United States and which file periodic reports
with the Commission, such as annual and quarterly reports.
Unlike the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions, the accounting
provisions do not apply to private companies. 246
Although the FCPA’s accounting requirements are
directed at “issuers,” an issuer’s books and records include
those of its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates. An issuer’s
responsibility thus extends to ensuring that subsidiaries
or affiliates under its control, including foreign subsidiaries
and joint venture partners, comply with the accounting
provisions. For instance, DOJ and SEC brought enforcement
actions against a California company for violating the
FCPA’s accounting provisions when two Chinese joint ventures
in which it was a partner paid more than $400,000 in
bribes over a four-year period to obtain business in China. 247
Sales personnel in China made the illicit payments by obtaining
cash advances from accounting personnel, who recorded
the payments on the books as “business fees” or “travel and
entertainment” expenses. Although the payments were made
exclusively in China by Chinese employees of the joint venture,
the California company failed to have adequate internal
controls and failed to act on red flags indicating that its affiliates
were engaged in bribery. The California company paid
$1.15 million in civil disgorgement and a criminal monetary
penalty of $1.7 million.
Companies may not be able to exercise the same level
of control over a minority-owned subsidiary or affiliate as
they do over a majority or wholly owned entity. Therefore,
if a parent company owns less than 50% of a subsidiary or
affiliate, the parent is only required to use its best efforts
to cause the minority-owned subsidiary or affiliate to
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls
consistent with the issuer’s own obligations under
the FCPA. 248 In evaluating an issuer’s good faith efforts,
all the circumstances—including “the relative degree of
the issuer’s ownership of the domestic or foreign firm and
the laws and practices governing the business operations
of the country in which such firm is located”—are taken
into account. 249
Civil Liability for Individuals and Other Entities
Companies (including subsidiaries of issuers) and
individuals may also face civil liability for aiding and abetting
or causing an issuer’s violation of the accounting provisions.
250 For example, in April 2010, SEC charged four
individuals—a Country Manager, a Senior Vice President
of Sales, a Regional Financial Director, and an International
Controller of a U.S. issuer—for their roles in schemes to
bribe Kyrgyz and Thai government officials to purchase
tobacco from their employer. The complaint alleged that,
among other things, the individuals aided and abetted the
issuer company’s violations of the books and records and
internal controls provisions by “knowingly provid[ing]
substantial assistance to” the parent company. 251 All four
executives settled the charges against them, consenting to
the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them
from violating the accounting and anti-bribery provisions,
with two executives paying civil penalties. 252 As in other
areas of federal securities law, corporate officers also can be
held liable as control persons. 253
Similarly, in October 2011, SEC brought an administrative
action against a U.S. water valve manufacturer and
a former employee of the company’s Chinese subsidiary
for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions. 254 The
Chinese subsidiary had made improper payments to employees
of certain design institutes to create design specifications
that favored the company’s valve products. The payments
were disguised as sales commissions in the subsidiary’s books
and records, thereby causing the U.S. issuer’s books and
records to be inaccurate. The general manager of the subsidiary,
who approved the payments and knew or should have
known that they were improperly recorded, was ordered to
cease-and-desist from committing or causing violations of
the accounting provisions, among other charges. 255
Additionally, individuals and entities can be held
directly civilly liable for falsifying an issuer’s books and
records or for circumventing internal controls. Exchange
Act Rule 13b2-1 provides: “No person shall, directly or
indirectly, falsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record
or account subject to [the books and records provision] of
the Securities Exchange Act.” 256 And Section 13(b)(5) of
43
the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)) provides that
“[n]o person shall knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail
to implement a system of internal accounting controls or
knowingly falsify any book, record, or account ….” 257 The
Exchange Act defines “person” to include a “natural person,
company, government, or political subdivision, agency, or
instrumentality of a government.” 258
An issuer’s officers and directors may also be held civilly
liable for making false statements to a company’s auditor.
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 prohibits officers and directors
from making (or causing to be made) materially false
or misleading statements, including an omission of material
facts, to an accountant. This liability arises in connection
with any audit, review, or examination of a company’s financial
statements or in connection with the filing of any document
with SEC. 259
Finally, the principal executive and principal financial
officer, or persons performing similar functions, can
be held liable for violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by
signing false personal certifications required by SOX.
Thus, for example, in January 2011, SEC charged the former
CEO of a U.S. issuer for his role in schemes to bribe
Iraqi government officials in connection with the United
Nations Oil-For-Food Programme and to bribe Iraqi and
Indonesian officials to purchase the company’s fuel additives.
There, the company used false invoices and sham consulting
contracts to support large bribes that were passed
on to foreign officials through an agent, and the bribes were
mischaracterized as legitimate commissions and travel fees
in the company’s books and records. The officer directed
and authorized the bribe payments and their false recording
in the books and records. He also signed annual and quarterly
SOX certifications in which he falsely represented that
the company’s financial statements were fairly presented
and the company’s internal controls sufficiently designed,
as well as annual representations to the company’s external
auditors where he falsely stated that he complied with the
company’s code of ethics and was unaware of any violations
of the code of ethics by anyone else. The officer was charged
with aiding and abetting violations of the books and records
and internal controls provisions, circumventing internal
chapter 3
The FCPA:
Accounting Provisions
controls, falsifying books and records, making false statements
to accountants, and signing false certifications. 260 He
consented to the entry of an injunction and paid disgorgement
and a civil penalty. 261 He also later pleaded guilty in
the United Kingdom to conspiring to corrupt Iraqi and
Indonesian officials. 262
Criminal Liability for Accounting Violations
Criminal liability can be imposed on companies
and individuals for knowingly failing to comply with the
FCPA’s books and records or internal controls provisions. 263
As with the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions, individuals are
only subject to the FCPA’s criminal penalties for violations
of the accounting provisions if they acted “willfully.” 264
For example, a French company was criminally
charged with failure to implement internal controls and
failure to keep accurate books and records, among other
violations. 265 As part of its deferred prosecution agreement,
the company admitted to numerous internal control failures,
including failure to implement sufficient anti-bribery
compliance policies, maintain a sufficient system for the
selection and approval of consultants, and conduct appropriate
audits of payments to purported “business consultants.”
266 Likewise, a German company pleaded guilty to
internal controls and books and records violations where,
from 2001 through 2007, it made payments totaling
approximately $1.36 billion through various mechanisms,
including $805.5 million as bribes and $554.5 million for
unknown purposes. 267
Individuals can be held criminally liable for accounting
violations. For example, a former managing director of a U.S.
bank’s real estate business in China pleaded guilty to conspiring
to evade internal accounting controls in order to transfer
a multi-million dollar ownership interest in a Shanghai
building to himself and a Chinese public official with whom
44
he had a personal friendship. The former managing director
repeatedly made false representations to his employer about
the transaction and the ownership interests involved. 268
Conspiracy and Aiding and Abetting Liability
As with the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions, companies
(including subsidiaries of issuers) and individuals may
face criminal liability for conspiring to commit or for aiding
and abetting violations of the accounting provisions.
For example, the subsidiary of a Houston-based
company pleaded guilty both to conspiring to commit and
to aiding and abetting the company’s books and records
and anti-bribery violations. 269 The subsidiary paid bribes
of over $4 million and falsely characterized the payments
as “commissions,” “fees,” or “legal services,” consequently
causing the company’s books and records to be inaccurate.
Although the subsidiary was not an issuer and therefore
could not be charged directly with an accounting violation,
it was criminally liable for its involvement in the parent
company’s accounting violation.
Similarly, a U.S. subsidiary of a Swiss freight forwarding
company that was not an issuer was charged with
conspiring to commit and with aiding and abetting the
books and records violations of its customers, who were
issuers and therefore subject to the FCPA’s accounting
provisions. 270 The U.S. subsidiary substantially assisted the
issuer-customers in violating the FCPA’s books and records
provision by masking the true nature of the bribe payments
in the invoices it submitted to the issuer-customers. 271 The
subsidiary thus faced criminal liability for its involvement
in the issuer-customers’ FCPA violations even though it
was not itself subject to the FCPA’s accounting provisions.
company’s operations and financial condition. A company’s
financial statements should be complete and fairly represent
the company’s financial condition. 272 Thus, under U.S.
GAAP, any payments to foreign government officials must
be properly accounted for in a company’s books, records,
and financial statements.
U.S. laws, including SEC Rules, require issuers to
undergo an annual external audit of their financial statements
and to make those audited financial statements available to
the public by filing them with SEC. SEC Rules and the rules
and standards issued by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB) under SEC oversight, require
external auditors to be independent of the companies that
they audit. Independent auditors must comply with the rules
and standards set forth by the PCAOB when they perform
an audit of a public company. These audit standards govern,
for example, the auditor’s responsibility concerning material
errors, irregularities, or illegal acts by a client and its officers,
directors, and employees. Additionally, the auditor has a
responsibility to obtain an understanding of an entity’s internal
controls over financial reporting as part of its audit and
must communicate all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses identified during the audit to management and
the audit committee. 273
Under Section 10A of the Exchange Act, independent
auditors who discover an illegal act, such as the payment
of bribes to domestic or foreign government officials,
have certain obligations in connection with their audits of
public companies. 274 Generally, Section 10A requires auditors
who become aware of illegal acts to report such acts to
appropriate levels within the company and, if the company
fails to take appropriate action, to notify SEC.
Auditor Obligations
All public companies in the United States must file
annual financial statements that have been prepared in
conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (U.S. GAAP). These accounting principles are
among the most comprehensive in the world. U.S. GAAP
requires an accounting of all assets, liabilities, revenue, and
expenses as well as extensive disclosures concerning the

Other Related
U.S. Laws
OTHER RELATED U.S. LAWS
Businesses and individuals should be aware that conduct that violates the
FCPA’s anti-bribery or accounting provisions may also violate other statutes or
regulations. Moreover, payments to foreign government officials and intermediaries
may violate these laws even if all of the elements of an FCPA violation
are not present.
Travel Act
The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, prohibits travel
in interstate or foreign commerce or using the mail or any
facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with the intent
to distribute the proceeds of any unlawful activity or to
promote, manage, establish, or carry on any unlawful activity.
275 “Unlawful activity” includes violations of not only
the FCPA, but also state commercial bribery laws. Thus,
bribery between private commercial enterprises may, in
some circumstances, be covered by the Travel Act. Said differently,
if a company pays kickbacks to an employee of a
private company who is not a foreign official, such privateto-private
bribery could possibly be charged under the
Travel Act.
DOJ has previously charged both individual and
corporate defendants in FCPA cases with violations of
the Travel Act. 276 For instance, an individual investor was
convicted of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel
Act in 2009 where the relevant “unlawful activity” under
the Travel Act was an FCPA violation involving a bribery
scheme in Azerbaijan. 277 Also in 2009, a California company
that engaged in both bribery of foreign officials in violation
of the FCPA and commercial bribery in violation of
California state law pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate
the FCPA and the Travel Act, among other charges. 278
Money Laundering
Many FCPA cases also involve violations of antimoney
laundering statutes. 279 For example, two Florida
executives of a Miami-based telecommunications company
were convicted of FCPA and money laundering conduct
where they conducted financial transactions involving the
proceeds of specified unlawful activities—violations of the
FCPA, the criminal bribery laws of Haiti, and wire fraud—
in order to conceal and disguise these proceeds. Notably,
although foreign officials cannot be prosecuted for FCPA
48
violations, 280 three former Haitian officials involved in the
same scheme were convicted of money laundering. 281
Mail and Wire Fraud
The mail and wire fraud statutes may also apply. In
2006, for example, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of
a U.S. issuer pleaded guilty to both FCPA and wire fraud
counts where the scheme included overbilling the subsidiary’s
customers—both government and private—and
using part of the overcharged money to pay kickbacks to the
customers’ employees. The wire fraud charges alleged that
the subsidiary had funds wired from its parent’s Oregon
bank account to off-the-books bank accounts in South
Korea that were controlled by the subsidiary. The funds,
amounting to almost $2 million, were then paid to managers
of state-owned and private steel production companies
in China and South Korea as illegal commission payments
and kickbacks that were disguised as refunds, commissions,
and other seemingly legitimate expenses. 282
sale of defense articles and services valued at $500,000 or
more triggers disclosure requirements concerning fees and
commissions, including bribes, in an aggregate amount of
$100,000 or more. 285 Violations of AECA and ITAR can
result in civil and criminal penalties. 286
Tax Violations
Individuals and companies who violate the FCPA may
also violate U.S. tax law, which explicitly prohibits tax deductions
for bribes, such as false sales “commissions” deductions
intended to conceal corrupt payments. 287 Internal Revenue
Service-Criminal Investigation has been involved in a number
of FCPA investigations involving tax violations, as well as
other financial crimes like money laundering.
Certification and Reporting Violations
Certain other licensing, certification, and reporting
requirements imposed by the U.S. government can also be
implicated in the foreign bribery context. For example, as
a condition of its facilitation of direct loans and loan guarantees
to a foreign purchaser of U.S. goods and services,
the Export-Import Bank of the United States requires the
U.S. supplier to make certifications concerning commissions,
fees, or other payments paid in connection with the
financial assistance and that it has not and will not violate
the FCPA. 283 A false certification may give rise to criminal
liability for false statements. 284
Similarly, manufacturers, exporters, and brokers of
certain defense articles and services are subject to registration,
licensing, and reporting requirements under the
Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C. § 2751, et
seq., and its implementing regulations, the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. § 120, et
seq. For example, under AECA and ITAR, all manufacturers
and exporters of defense articles and services must register
with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The

GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF
ENFORCEMENT
What Does DOJ Consider When
Deciding Whether to Open an
Investigation or Bring Charges?
Whether and how DOJ will commence, decline,
or otherwise resolve an FCPA matter is guided by the
Principles of Federal Prosecution in the case of individuals,
and the Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business
Organizations in the case of companies.
DOJ Principles of Federal Prosecution
The Principles of Federal Prosecution, set forth in
Chapter 9-27.000 of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual, 288 provide
guidance for DOJ prosecutors regarding initiating
or declining prosecution, selecting charges, and plea-bargaining.
The Principles of Federal Prosecution provide that
prosecutors should recommend or commence federal prosecution
if the putative defendant’s conduct constitutes a
federal offense and the admissible evidence will probably be
sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction unless (1) no
substantial federal interest would be served by prosecution;
(2) the person is subject to effective prosecution in another
jurisdiction; or (3) an adequate non-criminal alternative to
prosecution exists. In assessing the existence of a substantial
federal interest, the prosecutor is advised to “weigh all relevant
considerations,” including the nature and seriousness
of the offense; the deterrent effect of prosecution; the person’s
culpability in connection with the offense; the person’s
history with respect to criminal activity; the person’s
willingness to cooperate in the investigation or prosecution
of others; and the probable sentence or other consequences
if the person is convicted. The Principles of Federal
Prosecution also set out the considerations to be weighed
when deciding whether to enter into a plea agreement with
an individual defendant, including the nature and seriousness
of the offense and the person’s willingness to cooperate,
as well as the desirability of prompt and certain disposition
of the case and the expense of trial and appeal. 289
DOJ Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business
Organizations
The Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business
Organizations, set forth in Chapter 9-28.000 of the U.S.
Attorney’s Manual, 290 provide guidance regarding the resolun
of cases involving corporate wrongdoing. The Principles
tio
of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations recognize
that resolution of corporate criminal cases by means other
52
than indictment, including non-prosecution and deferred
prosecution agreements, may be appropriate in certain circumstances.
Nine factors are considered in conducting an
investigation, determining whether to charge a corporation,
and negotiating plea or other agreements:
• the nature and seriousness of the offense, including
the risk of harm to the public;
• the pervasiveness of wrongdoing within the corporation,
including the complicity in, or the condoning
of, the wrongdoing by corporate management;
• the corporation’s history of similar misconduct,
including prior criminal, civil, and regulatory
enforcement actions against it;
• the corporation’s timely and voluntary disclosure of
wrongdoing and its willingness to cooperate in the
investigation of its agents;
• the existence and effectiveness of the corporation’s
pre-existing compliance program;
• the corporation’s remedial actions, including any
efforts to implement an effective corporate compliance
program or improve an existing one, replace
responsible management, discipline or terminate
wrongdoers, pay restitution, and cooperate with the
relevant government agencies;
• collateral consequences, including whether there
is disproportionate harm to shareholders, pension
holders, employees, and others not proven personally
culpable, as well as impact on the public arising
from the prosecution;
• the adequacy of the prosecution of individuals
responsible for the corporation’s malfeasance; and
• the adequacy of remedies such as civil or regulatory
enforcement actions.
As these factors illustrate, in many investigations it
will be appropriate for a prosecutor to consider a corporation’s
pre-indictment conduct, including voluntary disclosure,
cooperation, and remediation, in determining whether
to seek an indictment. In assessing a corporation’s cooperation,
prosecutors are prohibited from requesting attorneyclient
privileged materials with two exceptions—when a
corporation or its employee asserts an advice-of-counsel
defense and when the attorney-client communications were
in furtherance of a crime or fraud. Otherwise, an organization’s
cooperation may only be assessed on the basis of
whether it disclosed the relevant facts underlying an investigation—and
not on the basis of whether it has waived its
attorney-client privilege or work product protection. 291
What Does SEC Consider When
Deciding Whether to Open an
Investigation or Bring Charges?
SEC’s Enforcement Manual, published by SEC’s
Enforcement Division and available on SEC’s website, 292
sets forth information about how SEC conducts investigations,
as well as the guiding principles that SEC staff
considers when determining whether to open or close an
investigation and whether civil charges are merited. There
are various ways that potential FCPA violations come to
the attention of SEC staff, including: tips from informants
or whistleblowers; information developed in other investigations;
self-reports or public disclosures by companies;
referrals from other offices or agencies; public sources, such
as media reports and trade publications; and proactive
investigative techniques, including risk-based initiatives.
Investigations can be formal, such as where SEC has issued
a formal order of investigation that authorizes its staff to
issue investigative subpoenas for testimony and documents,
or informal, such as where the staff proceeds with the investigation
without the use of investigative subpoenas.
In determining whether to open an investigation and,
if so, whether an enforcement action is warranted, SEC
staff considers a number of factors, including: the statutes
or rules potentially violated; the egregiousness of the potential
violation; the potential magnitude of the violation;
whether the potentially harmed group is particularly vulnerable
or at risk; whether the conduct is ongoing; whether
the conduct can be investigated efficiently and within the
statute of limitations period; and whether other authorities,
including federal or state agencies or regulators, might be
better suited to investigate the conduct. SEC staff also may
53
consider whether the case involves a possibly widespread
industry practice that should be addressed, whether the
case involves a recidivist, and whether the matter gives SEC
an opportunity to be visible in a community that might not
otherwise be familiar with SEC or the protections afforded
by the securities laws.

Division’s procedures concerning investigations, enforcement

Self-Reporting, Cooperation, and
Remedial Efforts
While the conduct underlying any FCPA investigation
is obviously a fundamental and threshold consideration
in deciding what, if any, action to take, both DOJ
and SEC place a high premium on self-reporting, along
with cooperation and remedial efforts, in determining the
appropriate resolution of FCPA matters.
Criminal Cases
Under DOJ’s Principles of Federal Prosecution of
Business Organizations, federal prosecutors consider a
company’s cooperation in determining how to resolve a
corporate criminal case. Specifically, prosecutors consider
whether the company made a voluntary and timely disprovide
rel-
closure as well as the company’s willingness to
evant information and evidence and identify relevant actors
inside and outside the company, including senior executives.
In addition, prosecutors may consider a company’s
remedial actions, including efforts to improve an existing
compliance program or appropriate disciplining of wrongdoers.
293 A company’s remedial measures should be meaningful
and illustrate its recognition of the seriousness of the
misconduct, for example, by taking steps to implement the
personnel, operational, and organizational changes necessary
to establish an awareness among employees that criminal
conduct will not be tolerated. 294
The Principles of Federal Prosecution similarly provide
that prosecutors may consider an individual’s willingness
chapter 5
Guiding Principles
of Enforcement
to cooperate in deciding whether a prosecution should
be undertaken and how it should be resolved. Although a
willingness to cooperate will not, by itself, generally relieve
a person of criminal liability, it may be given “serious consideration”
in evaluating whether to enter into a plea agreement
with a defendant, depending on the nature and value
of the cooperation offered. 295
The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines similarly take into
account an individual defendant’s cooperation and voluntary
disclosure. Under § 5K1.1, a defendant’s cooperation,
if sufficiently substantial, may justify the government filing
a motion for a reduced sentence. And under § 5K2.16, a
defendant’s voluntary disclosure of an offense prior to its
discovery—if the offense was unlikely to have been discovered
otherwise—may warrant a downward departure in
certain circumstances.
Chapter 8 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which governs
the sentencing of organizations, takes into account an
organization’s remediation as part of an “effective compliance
and ethics program.” One of the seven elements of
such a program provides that after the detection of criminal
conduct, “the organization shall take reasonable steps
to respond appropriately to the criminal conduct and to
prevent further similar criminal conduct, including making
any necessary modifications to the organization’s
compliance and ethics program.” 296 Having an effective
compliance and ethics program may lead to a three-point
reduction in an organization’s culpability score under
§ 8C2.5, which affects the fine calculation under the
Guidelines. Similarly, an organization’s self-reporting,
cooperation, and acceptance of responsibility may lead to
fine reductions under § 8C2.5(g) by decreasing the culpability
score. Conversely, an organization will not qualify
for the compliance program reduction when it unreasonably
delayed reporting the offense. 297 Similar to § 5K1.1
54
for individuals, organizations can qualify for departures
pursuant to § 8C4.1 of the Guidelines for cooperating in
the prosecution of others.
Civil Cases
SEC’s Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by
Companies
SEC’s framework for evaluating cooperation by companies
is set forth in its 2001 Report of Investigation Pursuant
to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Commission Statement on the Relationship of Cooperation to
Agency Enforcement Decisions, which is commonly known
as the Seaboard Report. 298 The report, which explained the
Commission’s decision not to take enforcement action
against a public company for certain accounting violations
caused by its subsidiary, details the many factors SEC considers
in determining whether, and to what extent, it grants leniency
to companies for cooperating in its investigations and
for related good corporate citizenship. Specifically, the report
identifies four broad measures of a company’s cooperation:
• self-policing prior to the discovery of the misconduct,
including establishing effective compliance
procedures and an appropriate tone at the top;
• self-reporting of misconduct when it is discovered,
including conducting a thorough review of the
nature, extent, origins, and consequences of the misconduct,
and promptly, completely, and effectively
disclosing the misconduct to the public, to regulatory
agencies, and to self-regulatory organizations;
• remediation, including dismissing or appropriately
disciplining wrongdoers, modifying and improving
internal controls and procedures to prevent
recurrence of the misconduct, and appropriately
compensating those adversely affected; and
• cooperation with law enforcement authorities,
including providing SEC staff with all information
relevant to the underlying violations and the
company’s remedial efforts.
Since every enforcement matter is different, this analytical
framework sets forth general principles but does not
limit SEC’s broad discretion to evaluate every case individually
on its own unique facts and circumstances. Similar
to SEC’s treatment of cooperating individuals, credit
for cooperation by companies may range from taking no
enforcement action to pursuing reduced sanctions in connection
with enforcement actions.
SEC’s Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by
Individuals
In 2010, SEC announced a new cooperation program
for individuals. 299 SEC staff has a wide range of tools to
facilitate and reward cooperation by individuals, from taking
no enforcement action to pursuing reduced sanctions in
connection with enforcement actions. Although the evaluation
of cooperation depends on the specific circumstances,
SEC generally evaluates four factors to determine whether,
to what extent, and in what manner to credit cooperation
by individuals:
• the assistance provided by the cooperating individual
in SEC’s investigation or related enforcement
actions, including, among other things: the
value and timeliness of the cooperation, including
whether the individual was the first to report the
misconduct to SEC or to offer his or her cooperation;
whether the investigation was initiated based
upon the information or other cooperation by the
individual; the quality of the cooperation, including
whether the individual was truthful and the
cooperation was complete; the time and resources
conserved as a result of the individual’s cooperation;
and the nature of the cooperation, such as the
type of assistance provided;
• the importance of the matter in which the individual
provided cooperation;
• the societal interest in ensuring that the cooperating
individual is held accountable for his or her
misconduct, including the severity of the individual’s
misconduct, the culpability of the individual,
and the efforts undertaken by the individual to
remediate the harm; and
55
• the appropriateness of a cooperation credit in light
of the profile of the cooperating individual.
Corporate Compliance Program
In a global marketplace, an effective compliance program
is a critical component of a company’s internal controls
and is essential to detecting and preventing FCPA violations.
300 Effective compliance programs are tailored to the
company’s specific business and to the risks associated with
that business. They are dynamic and evolve as the business
and the markets change.
An effective compliance program promotes “an organizational
culture that encourages ethical conduct and a
commitment to compliance with the law.” 301 Such a program
protects a company’s reputation, ensures investor value and
confidence, reduces uncertainty in business transactions, and
secures a company’s assets. 302 A well-constructed, thoughtfully
implemented, and consistently enforced compliance
and ethics program helps prevent, detect, remediate, and
report misconduct, including FCPA violations.
In addition to considering whether a company has
self-reported, cooperated, and taken appropriate remedial
actions, DOJ and SEC also consider the adequacy of a
company’s compliance program when deciding what, if any,
action to take. The program may influence whether or not
charges should be resolved through a deferred prosecution
agreement (DPA) or non-prosecution agreement (NPA),
as well as the appropriate length of any DPA or NPA, or
the term of corporate probation. It will often affect the
penalty amount and the need for a monitor or self-reporting.
303 As discussed above, SEC’s Seaboard Report focuses,
among other things, on a company’s self-policing prior to
the discovery of the misconduct, including whether it had
established effective compliance procedures. 304 Likewise,
three of the nine factors set forth in DOJ’s Principles of
Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations relate, either
directly or indirectly, to a compliance program’s design and
implementation, including the pervasiveness of wrongdoing
within the company, the existence and effectiveness of
the company’s pre-existing compliance program, and the
company’s remedial actions. 305 DOJ also considers the U.S.
chapter 5
Guiding Principles
of Enforcement
Sentencing Guidelines’ elements of an effective compliance
program, as set forth in § 8B2.1 of the Guidelines.
These considerations reflect the recognition that
a company’s failure to prevent every single violation does
not necessarily mean that a particular company’s compliance
program was not generally effective. DOJ and SEC
understand that “no compliance program can ever prevent
all criminal activity by a corporation’s employees,” 306 and
they do not hold companies to a standard of perfection. An
assessment of a company’s compliance program, including
its design and good faith implementation and enforcement,
is an important part of the government’s assessment of
whether a violation occurred, and if so, what action should
be taken. In appropriate circumstances, DOJ and SEC may
decline to pursue charges against a company based on the
company’s effective compliance program, or may otherwise
seek to reward a company for its program, even when that
program did not prevent the particular underlying FCPA
violation that gave rise to the investigation. 307
DOJ and SEC have no formulaic requirements
regarding compliance programs. Rather, they employ a
common-sense and pragmatic approach to evaluating compliance
programs, making inquiries related to three basic
questions:
• Is the company’s compliance program well
designed?
• Is it being applied in good faith?
• Does it work? 308
This guide contains information regarding some of
the basic elements DOJ and SEC consider when evaluating
compliance programs. Although the focus is on compliance
with the FCPA, given the existence of anti-corruption
laws in many other countries, businesses should consider
designing programs focused on anti-corruption compliance
more broadly. 309
56
Hallmarks of Effective Compliance
Programs
Individual companies may have different compliance
needs depending on their size and the particular risks associated
with their businesses, among other factors. When it
comes to compliance, there is no one-size-fits-all program.
Thus, the discussion below is meant to provide insight into
the aspects of compliance programs that DOJ and SEC
assess, recognizing that companies may consider a variety
of factors when making their own determination of what
is appropriate for their specific business needs. 310 Indeed,
small- and medium-size enterprises likely will have different
compliance programs from large multi-national corporations,
a fact DOJ and SEC take into account when evaluating
companies’ compliance programs.
Compliance programs that employ a “check-the-box”
approach may be inefficient and, more importantly, ineffective.
Because each compliance program should be tailored
to an organization’s specific needs, risks, and challenges,
the information provided below should not be considered
a substitute for a company’s own assessment of the corporate
compliance program most appropriate for that particular
business organization. In the end, if designed carefully,
implemented earnestly, and enforced fairly, a company’s
compliance program—no matter how large or small the
organization—will allow the company generally to prevent
violations, detect those that do occur, and remediate them
promptly and appropriately.
Commitment from Senior Management and a
Clearly Articulated Policy Against Corruption
Within a business organization, compliance begins
with the board of directors and senior executives setting
the proper tone for the rest of the company. Managers and
employees take their cues from these corporate leaders.
Thus, DOJ and SEC consider the commitment of corporate
leaders to a “culture of compliance” 311 and look to see
if this high-level commitment is also reinforced and implemented
by middle managers and employees at all levels of
a business. A well-designed compliance program that is
not enforced in good faith, such as when corporate management
explicitly or implicitly encourages employees to
engage in misconduct to achieve business objectives, will be
ineffective. DOJ and SEC have often encountered companies
with compliance programs that are strong on paper but
that nevertheless have significant FCPA violations because
management has failed to effectively implement the program
even in the face of obvious signs of corruption. This
may be the result of aggressive sales staff preventing compliance
personnel from doing their jobs effectively and of
senior management, more concerned with securing a valuable
business opportunity than enforcing a culture of compliance,
siding with the sales team. The higher the financial
stakes of the transaction, the greater the temptation for
management to choose profit over compliance.
A strong ethical culture directly supports a strong
compliance program. By adhering to ethical standards,
senior managers will inspire middle managers to reinforce
those standards. Compliant middle managers, in turn, will
encourage employees to strive to attain those standards
throughout the organizational structure. 312
In short, compliance with the FCPA and ethical rules
must start at the top. DOJ and SEC thus evaluate whether
senior management has clearly articulated company standards,
communicated them in unambiguous terms, adhered
to them scrupulously, and disseminated them throughout
the organization.
Code of Conduct and Compliance Policies and
Procedures
A company’s code of conduct is often the foundation
upon which an effective compliance program is built. As
DOJ has repeatedly noted in its charging documents, the
most effective codes are clear, concise, and accessible to all
employees and to those conducting business on the company’s
behalf. Indeed, it would be difficult to effectively
implement a compliance program if it was not available in
the local language so that employees in foreign subsidiaries
can access and understand it. When assessing a compliance
program, DOJ and SEC will review whether the company
57
has taken steps to make certain that the code of conduct
remains current and effective and whether a company has
periodically reviewed and updated its code.
Whether a company has policies and procedures that
outline responsibilities for compliance within the company,
detail proper internal controls, auditing practices, and documentation
policies, and set forth disciplinary procedures
will also be considered by DOJ and SEC. These types of
policies and procedures will depend on the size and nature
of the business and the risks associated with the business.
Effective policies and procedures require an in-depth
understanding of the company’s business model, including
its products and services, third-party agents, customers,
government interactions, and industry and geographic
risks. Among the risks that a company may need to address
include the nature and extent of transactions with foreign
governments, including payments to foreign officials; use
of third parties; gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses;
charitable and political donations; and facilitating and
expediting payments. For example, some companies with
global operations have created web-based approval processes
to review and approve routine gifts, travel, and entertainment
involving foreign officials and private customers
with clear monetary limits and annual limitations. Many of
these systems have built-in flexibility so that senior management,
or in-house legal counsel, can be apprised of and, in
appropriate circumstances, approve unique requests. These
types of systems can be a good way to conserve corporate
resources while, if properly implemented, preventing and
detecting potential FCPA violations.
Regardless of the specific policies and procedures
implemented, these standards should apply to personnel at
all levels of the company.
Oversight, Autonomy, and Resources
In appraising a compliance program, DOJ and SEC
also consider whether a company has assigned responsibility
for the oversight and implementation of a company’s
compliance program to one or more specific senior
executives within an organization. 313 Those individuals
must have appropriate authority within the organization,
chapter 5
Guiding Principles
of Enforcement
adequate autonomy from management, and sufficient
resources to ensure that the company’s compliance program
is implemented effectively. 314 Adequate autonomy generally
includes direct access to an organization’s governing
authority, such as the board of directors and committees
of the board of directors (e.g., the audit committee). 315
Depending on the size and structure of an organization,
it may be appropriate for day-to-day operational responsibility
to be delegated to other specific individuals within
a company. 316 DOJ and SEC recognize that the reporting
structure will depend on the size and complexity of an
organization. Moreover, the amount of resources devoted
to compliance will depend on the company’s size, complexity,
industry, geographical reach, and risks associated with
the business. In assessing whether a company has reasonable
internal controls, DOJ and SEC typically consider whether
the company devoted adequate staffing and resources to the
compliance program given the size, structure, and risk profile
of the business.
Risk Assessment
Assessment of risk is fundamental to developing a
strong compliance program, and is another factor DOJ
and SEC evaluate when assessing a company’s compliance
program. 317 One-size-fits-all compliance programs are
generally ill-conceived and ineffective because resources
inevitably are spread too thin, with too much focus on lowrisk
markets and transactions to the detriment of high-risk
areas. Devoting a disproportionate amount of time policing
modest entertainment and gift-giving instead of focusing
on large government bids, questionable payments to
third-party consultants, or excessive discounts to resellers
and distributors may indicate that a company’s compliance
program is ineffective. A $50 million contract with a
government agency in a high-risk country warrants greater
58
scrutiny than modest and routine gifts and entertainment.
Similarly, performing identical due diligence on all thirdparty
agents, irrespective of risk factors, is often counterproductive,
diverting attention and resources away from
those third parties that pose the most significant risks.
DOJ and SEC will give meaningful credit to a company
that implements in good faith a comprehensive, risk-based
compliance program, even if that program does not prevent
an infraction in a low risk area because greater attention
and resources had been devoted to a higher risk area.
Conversely, a company that fails to prevent an FCPA violation
on an economically significant, high-risk transaction
because it failed to perform a level of due diligence commensurate
with the size and risk of the transaction is likely
to receive reduced credit based on the quality and effectiveness
of its compliance program.
As a company’s risk for FCPA violations increases,
that business should consider increasing its compliance
procedures, including due diligence and periodic internal
audits. The degree of appropriate due diligence is fact-specific
and should vary based on industry, country, size, and
nature of the transaction, and the method and amount of
third-party compensation. Factors to consider, for instance,
include risks presented by: the country and industry sector,
the business opportunity, potential business partners, level
of involvement with governments, amount of government
regulation and oversight, and exposure to customs and
immigration in conducting business affairs. When assessing
a company’s compliance program, DOJ and SEC take into
account whether and to what degree a company analyzes
and addresses the particular risks it faces.
Training and Continuing Advice
Compliance policies cannot work unless effectively
communicated throughout a company. Accordingly, DOJ
and SEC will evaluate whether a company has taken steps to
ensure that relevant policies and procedures have been communicated
throughout the organization, including through
periodic training and certification for all directors, officers,
relevant employees, and, where appropriate, agents and
business partners. 318 For example, many larger companies
have implemented a mix of web-based and in-person training
conducted at varying intervals. Such training typically
covers company policies and procedures, instruction on
applicable laws, practical advice to address real-life scenarios,
and case studies. Regardless of how a company chooses
to conduct its training, however, the information should
be presented in a manner appropriate for the targeted audience,
including providing training and training materials
in the local language. For example, companies may want to
consider providing different types of training to their sales
personnel and accounting personnel with hypotheticals
or sample situations that are similar to the situations they
might encounter. In addition to the existence and scope of
a company’s training program, a company should develop
appropriate measures, depending on the size and sophistication
of the particular company, to provide guidance and
advice on complying with the company’s ethics and compliance
program, including when such advice is needed
urgently. Such measures will help ensure that the compliance
program is understood and followed appropriately at
all levels of the company.
Incentives and Disciplinary Measures
In addition to evaluating the design and implementation
of a compliance program throughout an organization,
enforcement of that program is fundamental to its effectiveness.
319 A compliance program should apply from the
board room to the supply room—no one should be beyond
its reach. DOJ and SEC will thus consider whether, when
enforcing a compliance program, a company has appropriate
and clear disciplinary procedures, whether those procedures
are applied reliably and promptly, and whether they
are commensurate with the violation. Many companies
have found that publicizing disciplinary actions internally,
where appropriate under local law, can have an important
deterrent effect, demonstrating that unethical and unlawful
actions have swift and sure consequences.
DOJ and SEC recognize that positive incentives can
also drive compliant behavior. These incentives can take many
59
forms such as personnel evaluations and promotions, rewards
for improving and developing a company’s compliance program,
and rewards for ethics and compliance leadership. 320
Some organizations, for example, have made adherence to
compliance a significant metric for management’s bonuses so
that compliance becomes an integral part of management’s
everyday concern. Beyond financial incentives, some companies
have highlighted compliance within their organizations
by recognizing compliance professionals and internal audit
staff. Others have made working in the company’s compliance
organization a way to advance an employee’s career.
SEC, for instance, has encouraged companies to embrace
methods to incentivize ethical and lawful behavior:
[M]ake integrity, ethics and compliance part of the
promotion, compensation and evaluation processes
as well. For at the end of the day, the most effective
way to communicate that “doing the right thing” is a
priority, is to reward it. Conversely, if employees are
led to believe that, when it comes to compensation
and career advancement, all that counts is short-term
profitability, and that cutting ethical corners is an acceptable
way of getting there, they’ll perform to that
measure. To cite an example from a different walk
of life: a college football coach can be told that the
graduation rates of his players are what matters, but
he’ll know differently if the sole focus of his contract
extension talks or the decision to fire him is his winloss
record. 321
No matter what the disciplinary scheme or potential
incentives a company decides to adopt, DOJ and SEC will
consider whether they are fairly and consistently applied
across the organization. No executive should be above compliance,
no employee below compliance, and no person
within an organization deemed too valuable to be disciplined,
if warranted. Rewarding good behavior and sanctioning
bad behavior reinforces a culture of compliance and
ethics throughout an organization.
Third-Party Due Diligence and Payments
DOJ’s and SEC’s FCPA enforcement actions demonstrate
that third parties, including agents, consultants,
and distributors, are commonly used to conceal the payment
of bribes to foreign officials in international business
chapter 5
Guiding Principles
of Enforcement
transactions. Risk-based due diligence is particularly important
with third parties and will also be considered by DOJ
and SEC in assessing the effectiveness of a company’s compliance
program.
Although the degree of appropriate due diligence
may vary based on industry, country, size and nature of the
transaction, and historical relationship with the third-party,
some guiding principles always apply.
First, as part of risk-based due diligence, companies
should understand the qualifications and associations of
its third-party partners, including its business reputation,
and relationship, if any, with foreign officials. The degree of
scrutiny should increase as red flags surface.
