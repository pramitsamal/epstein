Periodical and other reports
(a) Reports by issuer of security; contents
Every issuer of a security registered pursuant to section 78l of this title
shall file with the Commission, in accordance with such rules and regulations
as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate
for the proper protection of investors and to insure fair dealing in the
security—
(1) such information and documents (and such copies thereof ) as the
Commission shall require to keep reasonably current the information
and documents required to be included in or filed with an application
or registration statement filed pursuant to section 78l of this title,
except that the Commission may not require the filing of any material
contract wholly executed before July 1, 1962.
(2) such annual reports (and such copies thereof ), certified if required
by the rules and regulations of the Commission by independent public
accountants, and such quarterly reports (and such copies thereof ),
as the Commission may prescribe.
Every issuer of a security registered on a national securities exchange
shall also file a duplicate original of such information, documents,
and reports with the exchange. In any registration statement, periodic
report, or other reports to be filed with the Commission, an emerging
growth company need not present selected financial data in accordance
with section 229.301 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations,
for any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in connection
with its first registration statement that became effective
under this chapter or the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. §§ 77a,
et seq.] and, with respect to any such statement or reports, an emerging
growth company may not be required to comply with any new
or revised financial accounting standard until such date that a company
that is not an issuer (as defined under section 7201 of this title)
is required to comply with such new or revised accounting standard, if
such standard applies to companies that are not issuers.
(b) Form of report; books, records, and internal accounting; directives
(1) The Commission may prescribe, in regard to reports made pursuant
to this chapter, the form or forms in which the required information
shall be set forth, the items or details to be shown in the balance
sheet and the earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in
the preparation of reports, in the appraisal or valuation of assets and
liabilities, in the determination of depreciation and depletion, in the
differentiation of recurring and nonrecurring income, in the differentiation
of investment and operating income, and in the preparation,
where the Commission deems it necessary or desirable, of separate
and/or consolidated balance sheets or income accounts of any person
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any
person under direct or indirect common control with the issuer; but
in the case of the reports of any person whose methods of accounting
are prescribed under the provisions of any law of the United States,
or any rule or regulation thereunder, the rules and regulations of the
Commission with respect to reports shall not be inconsistent with
the requirements imposed by such law or rule or regulation in respect
of the same subject matter (except that such rules and regulations of
the Commission may be inconsistent with such requirements to the
extent that the Commission determines that the public interest or the
protection of investors so requires).
(2) Every issuer which has a class of securities registered pursuant to
section 78l of this title and every issuer which is required to file reports
pursuant to section 78o(d) of this title shall—
(A) make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the issuer;
(B) devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances that—
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general
or specific authorization;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
100
principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (II)
to maintain accountability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s
general or specific authorization; and
(iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing
assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any differences; and
(C) notwithstanding any other provision of law, pay the allocable
share of such issuer of a reasonable annual accounting support fee or
fees, determined in accordance with section 7219 of this title.
(3)(A) With respect to matters concerning the national security of the
United States, no duty or liability under paragraph (2) of this subsection
shall be imposed upon any person acting in cooperation with the
head of any Federal department or agency responsible for such matters
if such act in cooperation with such head of a department or agency
was done upon the specific, written directive of the head of such
department or agency pursuant to Presidential authority to issue such
directives. Each directive issued under this paragraph shall set forth
the specific facts and circumstances with respect to which the provisions
of this paragraph are to be invoked. Each such directive shall,
unless renewed in writing, expire one year after the date of issuance.
(B) Each head of a Federal department or agency of the United States
who issues such a directive pursuant to this paragraph shall maintain
a complete file of all such directives and shall, on October 1 of
each year, transmit a summary of matters covered by such directives
in force at any time during the previous year to the Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the
Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate.
(4) No criminal liability shall be imposed for failing to comply with
the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection except as provided
in paragraph (5) of this subsection.
(5) No person shall knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail to implement
a system of internal accounting controls or knowingly falsify any
book, record, or account described in paragraph (2).
(6) Where an issuer which has a class of securities registered pursuant
to section 78l of this title or an issuer which is required to file
reports pursuant to section 78o(d) of this title holds 50 per centum
or less of the voting power with respect to a domestic or foreign firm,
the provisions of paragraph (2) require only that the issuer proceed
in good faith to use its influence, to the extent reasonable under the
issuer’s circumstances, to cause such domestic or foreign firm to devise
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls consistent with
paragraph (2). Such circumstances include the relative degree of the
issuer’s ownership of the domestic or foreign firm and the laws and
practices governing the business operations of the country in which
such firm is located. An issuer which demonstrates good faith efforts
to use such influence shall be conclusively presumed to have complied
with the requirements of paragraph (2).
(7) For the purpose of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the terms “reasonable
assurances” and “reasonable detail” mean such level of detail
and degree of assurance as would satisfy prudent officials in the conduct
of their own affairs.

history/1977/houseprt-95-640.pdf. The House Report made clear
Congress’s concerns:
The payment of bribes to influence the acts or
decisions of foreign officials, foreign political parties
or candidates for foreign political office is unethical.
It is counter to the moral expectations and values of
the American public. But not only is it unethical, it
is bad business as well. It erodes public confidence
in the integrity of the free market system. It shortcircuits
the marketplace by directing business to
those companies too inefficient to compete in terms
of price, quality or service, or too lazy to engage in
honest salesmanship, or too intent upon unloading
marginal products. In short, it rewards corruption
instead of efficiency and puts pressure on ethical
enterprises to lower their standards or risk losing
business.

a severe threat to domestic and international security has galvanized
efforts to combat it in the United States and abroad. See, e.g., Int’l Anti-

President George W. Bush observed in 2006 that “the culture of
corruption has undercut development and good governance and
. . . . impedes our efforts to promote freedom and democracy, end
poverty, and combat international crime and terrorism.” President’s

available at http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/
releases/2006/08/20060810.html. The administrations of former
President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama both recognized
the threats posed to security and stability by corruption. For instance,
in issuing a proclamation restricting the entry of certain corrupt foreign
public officials, former President George W. Bush recognized “the
serious negative effects that corruption of public institutions has on the
United States’ efforts to promote security and to strengthen democratic
institutions and free market systems. . . .” Proclamation No. 7750, 69
Fed. Reg. 2287 ( Jan. 14, 2004). Similarly, President Barack Obama’s
National Security Strategy paper, released in May 2010, expressed the
administration’s efforts and commitment to promote the recognition that
“pervasive corruption is a violation of basic human rights and a severe
impediment to development and global security.” The White House,

See Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, § 5003(d). The
amended statute included the following directive:
It is the sense of the Congress that the President
should pursue the negotiation of an international
agreement, among the members of the Organization
of Economic Cooperation and Development, to
govern persons from those countries concerning
acts prohibited with respect to issuers and domestic
concerns by the amendments made by this section.
Such international agreement should include a
process by which problems and conflicts associated
with such acts could be resolved.

Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
International Business Transactions art. 1.1, Dec. 18, 1997, 37 I.L.M. 1
[hereinafter Anti-Bribery Convention]. The Anti-Bribery Convention
requires member countries to make it a criminal offense “for any person
intentionally to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other
advantage, whether directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign
public official, for that official or for a third party, in order that the
official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of
official duties, in order to obtain or retain business or other improper
advantage in the conduct of international business.” The Convention
and its commentaries also call on all parties (a) to ensure that aiding and
abetting and authorization of an act of bribery are criminal offenses, (b)
to assert territorial jurisdiction “broadly so that an extensive physical
connection to the bribery act is not required,” and (c) to assert nationality
jurisdiction consistent with the general principles and conditions of each
party’s legal system. Id. at art. 1.2, cmts. 25, 26.

In amending the FCPA in 1988, Congress made clear that the business
purpose element, and specifically the “retaining business” prong, was
meant to be interpreted broadly:
The Conferees wish to make clear that the reference
to corrupt payments for “retaining business” in
present law is not limited to the renewal of contracts
or other business, but also includes a prohibition
against corrupt payments related to the execution
or performance of contracts or the carrying out of
existing business, such as a payment to a foreign
official for the purpose of obtaining more favorable
tax treatment. The term should not, however, be
construed so broadly as to include lobbying or other
normal representations to government officials.

United States v. Kay, 359 F.3d 738, 755-56 (5th Cir. 2004).
70
Id. at 749. Indeed, the Kay court found that Congress’ explicit
exclusion of facilitation payments from the scope of the FCPA was
evidence that “Congress intended for the FCPA to prohibit all other
illicit payments that are intended to influence non-trivial official foreign
action in an effort to aid in obtaining or retaining business for some
person.” Id. at 749-50 (emphasis added).

Id. at 749-55.
73
Id. at 756 (“It still must be shown that the bribery was intended to
produce an effect—here, through tax savings—that would ‘assist in
obtaining or retaining business.’”).
74
The FCPA does not explicitly define “corruptly,” but in drafting the
statute Congress adopted the meaning ascribed to the same term in the
domestic bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201(b). See H.R. Rep. No. 95-640,
at 7.
75
The House Report states in full:
The word “corruptly” is used in order to make
clear that the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must
be intended to induce the recipient to misuse
his official position; for example, wrongfully to
direct business to the payor or his client, to obtain
preferential legislation or regulations, or to induce a
foreign official to fail to perform an official function.
The word “corruptly” connotes an evil motive or
purpose such as that required under 18 U.S.C.
201(b) which prohibits domestic bribery. As in
18 U.S.C. 201(b), the word “corruptly” indicates
an intent or desire wrongfully to influence the
recipient. It does not require that the act [be] fully
consummated or succeed in producing the desired
outcome.
Id. The Senate Report provides a nearly identical explanation of the
meaning of the term:
The word “corruptly” is used in order to make
clear that the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must
be intended to induce the recipient to misuse
his official position in order to wrongfully direct
business to the payor or his client, or to obtain
107
preferential legislation or a favorable regulation.
The word “corruptly” connotes an evil motive or
purpose, an intent to wrongfully influence the
recipient.

86
The phrase “anything of value” is not defined in the FCPA, but the
identical phrase under the domestic bribery statute has been broadly
construed to include both tangible and intangible benefits. See, e.g.,
United States v. Moore, 525 F.3d 1033, 1048 (11th Cir. 2008) (rejecting
defendant’s objection to instruction defining sex as a “thing of value,”
which “unambiguously covers intangible considerations”); United
States v. Gorman, 807 F.2d 1299, 1304-05 (6th Cir. 1986) (holding that
loans and promises of future employment are “things of value”); United
States v. Williams, 705 F.2d 603, 622-23 (2d Cir. 1983) (approving jury
instruction that stock could be a “thing of value” if defendant believed it
had value, even though the shares had no commercial value, and noting
that “[t]he phrase ‘anything of value’ in bribery and related statutes has
consistently been given a broad meaning”).
87
Section 30A(a), 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1(a); 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2(a), 78dd-
3(a) (emphasis added).
88
Like the FCPA, the domestic bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201, prohibits
giving, offering, or promising “anything of value.” Numerous domestic
bribery cases under Section 201 have involved “small” dollar bribes.
See, e.g., United States v. Franco, 632 F.3d 880, 882-84 (5th Cir. 2011)
(affirming bribery convictions of inmate for paying correctional officer
$325 to obtain cell phone, food, and marijuana, and noting that 18
U.S.C. § 201 does not contain minimum monetary threshold); United
States v. Williams, 216 F.3d 1099, 1103 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (affirming
bribery conviction for $70 bribe to vehicle inspector); United States v.
Traitz, 871 F.2d 368, 396 (3rd Cir. 1989) (affirming bribery conviction
for $100 bribe paid to official of Occupational Health and Safety
Administration); United States v. Hsieh Hui Mei Chen, 754 F.2d 817,
822 (9th Cir. 1985) (affirming bribery convictions including $100 bribe
to immigration official); United States v. Bishton, 463 F.2d 887, 889

113
Under the FCPA, any person “acting in an official capacity for
or on behalf of ” a foreign government, a department, agency, or
instrumentality thereof, or a public international organization, is a
foreign official. Section 30A(f )(1)(A), 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1(f )(1)(A); 15
U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2(h)(2)(A), 78dd-2(f )(2)(A). See also U.S. Dept. of

(4) (facilitating payments exception).
115
Even though payments to a foreign government may not violate the
anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, such payments may violate other
U.S. laws, including wire fraud, money laundering, and the FCPA’s
accounting provisions. This was the case in a series of matters brought by
DOJ and SEC involving kickbacks to the Iraqi government through the
United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme. See, e.g., Complaint, SEC v.

The United States has some state-owned entities, like the Tennessee
Valley Authority, that are instrumentalities of the government. McCarthy
v. Middle Tenn. Elec. Membership Corp., 466 F.3d 399, 411 n.18
(6th Cir. 2006) (“[T]here is no question that TVA is an agency and
instrumentality of the United States.”) (internal quotes omitted).
117
During the period surrounding the FCPA’s adoption, state-owned
entities held virtual monopolies and operated under state-controlled
price-setting in many national industries around the world. See generally
World Bank, Bureaucrats in Business: The Economics
and Politics of Government Ownership, World Bank
Policy Research Report at 78 (1995); Sunita Kikeri and

Id. at 1 (“[A]fter more than two decades of privatization, government
ownership and control remains widespread in many regions—and in
many parts of the world still dominates certain sectors.”).
119
To date, consistent with the approach taken by DOJ and SEC, all
district courts that have considered this issue have concluded that this is
an issue of fact for a jury to decide. See Order, United States v. Carson,
2011 WL 5101701, No. 09-cr-77 (C.D. Cal. May 18, 2011), ECF No.
373 [hereinafter United States v. Carson]; United States v. Aguilar, 783

admitted to violating the FCPA by bribing officials of state-owned or
state-controlled entities. See Government’s Opposition to Defendants’

relieved bribe payors of criminal liability if they were extorted did
not make the bribe payments legal. Azeri extortion law precludes the
prosecution of the payor of the bribes for the illegal payments, but it does
not make the payments legal. Id. at 540-41.

For example, DOJ has previously approved expenditures on behalf of
family members or for entertainment purposes under certain, limited
circumstances. See, e.g., U.S. Dept. of Justice, FCPA Rev. P. Release
83-02 ( July 26, 1983) (declining to take enforcement action against
company seeking to provide promotional tour for foreign official and
wife, where both had already planned a trip to the United States at their
own expense and company proposed to pay only for all reasonable and
necessary actual domestic expenses for the extension of their travel to
allow the promotional tour, which would not exceed $5,000), available at
http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/review/1983/r8302.pdf.
159
Unlike the local law and bona fide expenditures defenses, the
facilitating payments exception is not an affirmative defense to the
FCPA. Rather, payments of this kind fall outside the scope of the
FCPA’s bribery prohibition. Prior to 1988, the “facilitating payments”
exception was incorporated into the definition of “foreign official,” which
excluded from the statute’s purview officials whose duties were primarily
ministerial or clerical. See Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, Pub.
L. No. 95-213, § 104(d)(2), 91 Stat. 1494, 1498 (1977) (providing that
the term foreign official “does not include any employee of a foreign
government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof whose
duties are essentially ministerial or clerical”). The original exception thus
focused on the duties of the recipient, rather than the purpose of the
payment. In practice, however, it proved difficult to determine whether
a foreign official’s duties were “ministerial or clerical.” S. Rep. No. 100-
85, at 53. Responding to criticism that the statutory language “does not
clearly reflect Congressional intent and the boundaries of the prohibited
conduct,” Congress revised the FCPA to define the exception in terms of
the purpose of the payment. H. Rep. No. 100-40, pt. 2, at 77. In doing so,
Congress reiterated that while its policy to exclude facilitating payments
reflected practical considerations of enforcement, “such payments should
not be condoned.” Id. The enacted language reflects this narrow purpose.
160
In exempting facilitating payments, Congress sought to distinguish
them as “payments which merely move a particular matter toward an
eventual act or decision or which do not involve any discretionary action,”
giving the examples of “a gratuity paid to a customs official to speed the
processing of a customs document” or “payments made to secure permits,
licenses, or the expeditious performance of similar duties of an essentially
ministerial or clerical nature which must of necessity be performed in any
event.” H.R. Rep. No. 95-640, at 8.
161
Section 30A(f )(3)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1(f )(3)
(B); 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2(h)(4)(B), 78dd-3(f )(4)(B).
162
In a 2004 decision, the Fifth Circuit emphasized this precise point,
commenting on the limited nature of the facilitating payments exception:
A brief review of the types of routine governmental
actions enumerated by Congress shows how limited
Congress wanted to make the grease exceptions.
Routine governmental action, for instance, includes
“obtaining permits, licenses, or other official
documents to qualify a person to do business in
a foreign country,” and “scheduling inspections
associated with contract performance or inspections
related to transit of goods across country.”
Therefore, routine governmental action does not
include the issuance of every official document or
every inspection, but only (1) documentation that
qualifies a party to do business and (2) scheduling an
inspection—very narrow categories of largely nondiscretionary,
ministerial activities performed by
mid- or low-level foreign functionaries.

These payments, however, must be accurately reflected in the
company’s books and records so that the company and its management
are aware of the payments and can assure that the payments were properly
made under the circumstances. For example, in one instance, a Kazakh
immigration prosecutor threatened to fine, jail, or deport employees
of a U.S. company’s subsidiary. Believing the threats to be genuine, the
employees in Kazakhstan sought guidance from senior management
of the U.S. subsidiary and were authorized to make the payments. The
employees then paid the government official a total of $45,000 using
personal funds. The subsidiary reimbursed the employees, but it falsely
recorded the reimbursements as “salary advances” or “visa fines.” The
parent company, which eventually discovered these payments, as well
as other improperly booked cash payments made to a Kazakhstani
consultant to obtain visas, was charged with civil violations of the
accounting provisions. Admin. Proceeding Order, In the Matter of
