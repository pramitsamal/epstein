18 U.S.C. § 2.
200
In enacting the FCPA in 1977, Congress explicitly noted that “[t]he
concepts of aiding and abetting and joint participation would apply to a
violation under this bill in the same manner in which those concepts have
always applied in both SEC civil actions and in implied private actions
brought under the securities laws generally.” H.R. Rep. No. 95-640, at 8.
201
Pinkerton held that a conspirator may be found guilty of a substantive
offense committed by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy
if the co-conspirator’s acts were reasonably foreseeable. See Pinkerton v.
United States, 328 U.S. 640, 647-48 (1946).

204
Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, “Prosecution of Persons Who
Aid and Abet Violations,” explicitly provides that, for purposes of a
civil action seeking injunctive relief or a civil penalty, “any person that
knowingly or recklessly provides substantial assistance to another person
in violation of a provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation
issued under this chapter, shall be deemed to be in violation of such
provision to the same extent as the person to whom such assistance is
provided.” Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78t(e).
205
Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the SEC may impose a
cease-and-desist order through the SEC’s administrative proceedings
upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any
provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and
upon any other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation,
due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would
contribute to such violation. Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act,15
U.S.C. § 78u-3(a).
206
See Complaint, SEC v. Panalpina, Inc., supra note 68.

18 U.S.C. § 3282(a) provides: “Except as otherwise expressly provided
by law, no person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense,
not capital, unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted
within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.”
208
See Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 396-97 (1957)
(holding government must prove conspiracy still existed and at least
one overt act was committed within the statute of limitations); Fiswick
v. United States, 329 U.S. 211, 216 (1946) (“The statute of limitations,
unless suspended, runs from the last overt act during the existence of
the conspiracy. The overt acts averred and proved may thus mark the
duration, as well as the scope, of the conspiracy.”) (citation omitted); see

S. Rep. No. 95-114, at 3 (noting that, in the past, “corporate bribery
has been concealed by the falsification of corporate books and records,”
that the accounting provisions “remove [] this avenue of coverup,” and
that “[t]aken together, the accounting requirements and criminal [antibribery]
prohibitions . . . should effectively deter corporate bribery of
foreign government officials”).

215
The accounting provisions contain a narrow exemption related to
national security and the protection of classified information. Under
this “national security” provision, “no duty or liability [under Section
13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act] shall be imposed upon any person acting
in cooperation with the head of any federal department or agency
responsible for such matters if such act in cooperation with such head of
a department or agency was done upon the specific, written directive of
the head of such department or agency pursuant to Presidential authority
to issue such directives.” Section 13(b)(3) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
§ 78m(b)(3). As Congress made clear, however, the exception is narrowly
tailored and intended to prevent the disclosure of classified information.

about audit failures and financial fraud and resultant recommendations
by experts for stronger accounting practices and audit standards.” Id.

Although private companies are not covered by the books and records
and internal controls provisions of the FCPA and do not fall within
SEC’s jurisdiction, such companies generally are required by federal and
state tax laws and state corporation laws to maintain accurate books and
records sufficient to properly calculate taxes owed. Further, most large
private companies maintain their books and records to facilitate the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP to comply
with financial institutions’ lending requirements.

See Section 13(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b) (6),
which provides that where an issuer “holds 50 per centum or less of the
voting power with respect to a domestic or foreign firm,” the issuer must
“proceed in good faith to use its influence, to the extent reasonable under
the issuer’s circumstances, to cause such domestic or foreign firm to devise
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls consistent with
[Section 13(b)(2)].”
249
See 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(6). Congress added the language in subsection
78m(b)(6) to the FCPA in 1988, recognizing that “it is
unrealistic to expect a minority owner to exert a disproportionate degree
of influence over the accounting practices of a subsidiary.” H.R. Rep.
No. 100-576, at 917. The Conference Report noted that, with respect
to minority owners, “the amount of influence which an issuer may
exercise necessarily varies from case to case. While the relative degree of
ownership is obviously one factor, other factors may also be important in
determining whether an issuer has demonstrated good-faith efforts to use
its influence.” Id.; see also S. Rep. No. 100-85, at 50.
250
Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, titled “Prosecution of Persons

in violation of a provision of this title, or of any rule or regulation issued

Foreign officials may “not be charged with violating the FCPA itself,
since the [FCPA] does not criminalize the receipt of a bribe by a foreign
official.” United States v. Blondek, 741 F.Supp. 116, 117 (N.D. Tex.
1990), aff ’d United States v. Castle, 925 F.2d 831 (5th Cir. 1991) (“We
hold that foreign officials may not be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. §
371 for conspiring to violate the FCPA.”). Foreign officials, however,
can be charged with violating the FCPA when the foreign official acts
as an intermediary of a bribe payment. See, e.g., Information, United
States v. Basu, No. 02-cr-475 (D.D.C. Nov. 26, 2002) (World Bank

on the same underlying facts as the criminal guilty plea, BAE entered
a civil settlement with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls for
violations of AECA and ITAR, including over 2500 ITAR violations
that included a failure to report the payment of fees or commissions
associated with defense transactions and failure to maintain records
involving ITAR-controlled transactions. BAE paid $79 million in
penalties, and the State Department imposed a “policy of denial” for
export licenses on three BAE subsidiaries involved in the wrongful
conduct. Consent Agreement between BAE Sys. plc and Defense Trade

Debarment authorities, such as the Department of Defense or
the General Services Administration, may also consider a company’s
compliance program when deciding whether to debar or suspend
a contractor. Specifically, the relevant regulations provide that the
debarment authority should consider “[w]hether the contractor had
effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at
the time of the activity which constitutes cause for debarment or had
adopted such procedures prior to any Government investigation of the
activity cited as a cause for debarment,” and “[w]hether the contractor
has instituted or agreed to institute new or revised review and control
procedures and ethics training programs.” 48 C.F.R. § 9.406-1(a).

USAM § 9-28.300. When evaluating the pervasiveness of wrongdoing
within the corporation, prosecutors are advised that while it may be
appropriate to charge a corporation for minor misconduct where the
wrongdoing was pervasive, “it may not be appropriate to impose liability
upon a corporation, particularly one with a robust compliance program in
place, under a strict respondeat superior theory for the single isolated act
of a rogue employee.” Id. § 9-28.500.A (emphasis added). Prosecutors
should also consider a company’s compliance program when examining
any remedial actions taken, including efforts to implement an effective
compliance program or to improve an existing one. As the commentary
explains, “although the inadequacy of a corporate compliance program is
a factor to consider when deciding whether to charge a corporation, that
corporation’s quick recognition of the flaws in the program and its efforts
to improve the program are also factors to consider as to appropriate
disposition of a case.” Id. § 9-28.900.B. Finally, the Principles of Federal
Prosecution of Business Organizations provides that prosecutors should
consider the existence and effectiveness of the corporation’s pre-existing
compliance program in determining how to treat a corporate target. Id.
§ 9-28.800.

See USAM § 9-28.800.B; see also U.S. Sentencing Guidelines §

This is also reflected in the Sentencing Guidelines, which recognizes
that no single, formulaic set of requirements should be imposed, but
instead focuses on a number of factors like applicable industry practice
or the standards called for by any applicable governmental regulation,
the size of the organization, and whether the organization has engaged
in similar misconduct in the past. See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines §
8B2.1 & app. note 2 (2011).
311
This was underscored by then-SEC Commissioner Cynthia Glassman
in 2003 in a speech on the SEC’s implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act: “[T]he ultimate effectiveness of the new corporate governance rules
will be determined by the ‘tone at the top.’ Adopting a code of ethics
means little if the company’s chief executive officer or its directors make
clear, by conduct or otherwise, that the code’s provisions do not apply

to them. . . . Corporate officers and directors hold the ultimate power
and responsibility for restoring public trust by conducting themselves
in a manner that is worthy of the trust that is placed in them.” Cynthia
Glassman, SEC Implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley: The New Corporate
Governance, Remarks at National Economists Club (April 7, 2003),
available at http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/spch040703cag.htm .
312
Indeed, research has found that “[e]thical culture is the single biggest
factor determining the amount of misconduct that will take place in a
business.” Ethics Resource Center, 2009 National Business
Ethics Survey: Ethics in the Recession (2009), at 41. Metrics
of ethical culture include ethical leadership (tone at the top), supervisor
reinforcement of ethical behavior (middle management reinforcement),
and peer commitment (supporting one another in doing the right
thing). Ethics Resource Center, 2011 National Business
Ethics Survey: Workplace Ethics in Transition (2012) at 19.
Strong ethical cultures and strong ethics and compliance programs are
related, as data show that a well-implemented program helps lead to a
strong ethical culture. Id. at 34. “Understanding the nature of any gap
between the desired culture and the actual culture is a critical first step in
determining the nature of any ethics-based risks inside the organization.”
David Gebler, The Role of Culture at 1.7, in Society of Corporate
Compliance and Ethics, The Complete Compliance and
Ethics Manual (2011). To create an ethical culture, attention must be
paid to norms at all levels of an organization, including the “tone at the
top,” “mood in the middle,” and “buzz at the bottom.” Id. 1.9-1.10.

engaged in interviews with DOJ and provided truthful and complete
information about their conduct; (3) a parent company conducted
extensive pre-acquisition due diligence of potentially liable subsidiaries
and engaged in significant remediation efforts post-acquisition; (4) a
company provided information about its extensive compliance policies,
procedures, and internal controls; (5) a company agreed to a civil
resolution with the Securities and Exchange Commission while also
demonstrating that criminal declination was appropriate; (6) only a single

facts and circumstances, including that Morgan Stanley constructed and
maintained a system of internal controls, which provided reasonable

15 U.S.C. § 78u-6(a)(3). The new provision defines “original
information” to mean information that:
(A) is derived from the independent knowledge
or analysis of a whistleblower; (B) is not known
to the Commission from any other source, unless
the whistleblower is the original source of the
information; and (C) is not exclusively derived from
an allegation made in a judicial or administrative
hearing, in a governmental report, hearing, audit,
or investigation, or from the news media, unless the
whistleblower is a source of the information.
393
15 U.S.C. § 78u-6; see also Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, § 922, 124 Stat. 1376,
1841-49 (2010).
394
For detailed information about the program, including eligibility
requirements and certain limitations that apply, see Section 922 of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, available
at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/owb/dodd-frank-sec-922.pdf,
and the final rules on eligibility, Exchange Act Rule 21F-8, 17 C.F.R. §
240.21F-8.
395
For example, the rules: (1) make a whistleblower eligible for an award
if the whistleblower reports original information internally, and the
company informs the SEC about the violations; (2) give whistleblowers
120 days to report information to the SEC after first reporting
internally and still be treated as if he or she had reported to the SEC
at the earlier reporting date , thus preserving their “place in line” for
a possible whistleblower award from the SEC; and (3) provide that a
whistleblower’s voluntary participation in an entity’s internal compliance
and reporting systems is a factor that can increase the amount of an
award, and that a whistleblower’s interference with internal compliance
and reporting system is a factor that can decrease the amount of an award.
See Exchange Act Rule 21F, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F.
396
See Exchange Act Rule 21F-7(b), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-7(b).
397
For example, SEC staff will not disclose a whistleblower’s identity in
response to requests under the Freedom of Information Act. However,
there are limits on SEC’s ability to shield a whistleblower’s identity,
and in certain circumstances SEC must disclose it to outside entities.
For example, in an administrative or court proceeding, SEC may be
required to produce documents or other information that would
reveal the whistleblower’s identity. In addition, as part of ongoing
SEC investigatory responsibilities, SEC staff may use information
provided by a whistleblower during the course of the investigation. In
appropriate circumstances, SEC may also provide information, subject
to confidentiality requirements, to other governmental or regulatory
entities. Exchange Act Rule 21F-7(a), 17 C.F.R. 240.21F-7(a).
398
Although SEC does not have an opinion procedure release process,
it has declared its decision to follow the guidance announced through
DOJ’s FCPA Opinion Release Procedure. U.S. Sec. and Exchange
Comm., SEC Release No. 34-17099 (Aug. 29, 1980), available at http://
www.sec.gov/news/digest/1980/dig082980.pdf. SEC Release No. 34-
17099 stated that, to encourage issuers to take advantage of the DOJ’s
FCPA Review Procedure, as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, SEC
would “not take enforcement action alleging violations of Section 30A
in any case where an issuer has sought and obtained an FCPA Review
letter from the Department, prior to May 31, 1981, stating that the
Department will not take enforcement action under Section 30A with
respect to the transaction involved.” Id. The release further noted that it
would revisit this policy once the DOJ had evaluated the results of the
FCPA Review Procedure after its first year of operation. A second release
stated that the SEC would continue to adhere to the policy announced
in Release No. 34-17099. U.S. Sec. and Exchange Comm., SEC Release
No. 34-18255 (Nov. 13, 1981), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/
digest/1981/dig111381.pdf.

Both DOJ’s opinion procedure releases (from 1993 to present) and
review procedure releases (from 1980-1992) are available at http://www.
justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/opinion.
400
The full regulations relating to DOJ’s opinion procedure are available
at http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/docs/frgncrpt.pdf.
401
28 C.F.R. § 80.1.
402
28 C.F.R. § 80.3.
403
28 C.F.R. § 80.12 (“Neither the submission of a request for an
FCPA Opinion, its pendency, nor the issuance of an FCPA Opinion,
shall in any way alter the responsibility of an issuer to comply with the
accounting requirements of 15 U.S.C. 78m(b)(2) and (3).”).
404
28 C.F.R. § 80.4.
405
28 C.F.R. § 80.5.
406
28 C.F.R. § 80.6.
407
28 C.F.R. § 80.14(a). This non-disclosure policy applies regardless of
whether DOJ responds to the request or the party withdraws the request
before receiving a response. Id.
408
28 C.F.R. § 80.6.
409
28 C.F.R. § 80.2.
410
In connection with any request for an FCPA opinion, DOJ may
conduct whatever independent investigation it believes appropriate. 28
C.F.R. § 80.7.
411
28 C.F.R. § 80.15. Once a request is withdrawn, it has no effect.
However, DOJ reserves the right to retain a copy of any FCPA
opinion request, documents, and information submitted during the
opinion release procedure for any governmental purpose, subject to the
restrictions on disclosures in 28 C.F.R. § 80.14.
412
28 C.F.R. § 80.8.
413
28 C.F.R. § 80.7. “Such additional information, if furnished orally,
must be confirmed in writing promptly. The same person who signed
the initial request must sign the written, supplemental information and
must again certify it to be a true, correct and complete disclosure of the
requested information.” Id.
414
28 C.F.R. § 80.9 (“No oral clearance, release or other statement
119
purporting to limit the enforcement discretion of the Department of
Justice may be given. The requesting issuer or domestic concern may rely
only upon a written FCPA opinion letter signed by the Attorney General
or his designee.”).
415
28 C.F.R. § 80.8. FCPA opinions do not bind or obligate any agency
other than DOJ. They also do not affect the requesting party’s obligations
to any other agency or under any statutory or regulatory provision other
than those specifically cited in the particular FCPA opinion. 28 C.F.R. §
80.11. If the conduct for which an FCPA opinion is requested is subject
to approval by any other agency, such FCPA opinion may not be taken
to indicate DOJ’s views on any legal or factual issues before that other
agency. 28 C.F.R. § 80.13.
416
28 C.F.R. § 80.10. DOJ can rebut this presumption by a
preponderance of the evidence. A court determining whether the
presumption has been rebutted weighs all relevant factors, including
whether the submitted information was accurate and complete and the
activity was within the scope of conduct specified in the request. Id. As of
September 2012, DOJ has never pursued an enforcement action against a
party for conduct that formed the basis of an FCPA opinion stating that
the prospective conduct would violate DOJ’s present enforcement policy.
417
As a general matter, DOJ normally anonymizes much of the
information in its publicly released opinions and includes the general
nature and circumstances of the proposed conduct. DOJ does not release
the identity of any foreign sales agents or other types of identifying
information. 28 C.F.R. § 80.14(b). However, DOJ may release the
identity of the requesting party, the foreign country in which the
proposed conduct is to take place, and any actions DOJ took in response
to the FCPA opinion request. Id. If a party believes that an opinion
contains proprietary information, it may request that DOJ remove or
anonymize those portions of the opinion before it is publicly released. 28
C.F.R. § 80.14(c).
418
28 C.F.R. § 80.16.
