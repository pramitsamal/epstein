osteao 1 motion, Exhibit 2, you knew that the United States
estes «2 Attorney's Office had denied having any contact -- any
osteaa. 3 documents reflecting any contact with Prince Andrew;
atest 4 isn't that true?
ostes1 5 A. They had -- there were -~ there were various
aisss 6 discovery requests that had been propounded, and I think
oies9 % with regard to one, they had denied, and my recollection
031701 8 is with regard to another, where there had been an
031706 9 assertion of privilege.
o3i707 10 Q. Is it not true, that before December 30th,
o3:1700 11 2014, in response to a request asking the government:
031715 12 Are there any documents reflecting contact with -- by
031720 13 Prince Andrew regarding the NPA, the government
031724 14 represented, there were none?
031726 15 A. That -- with regard to the -- you're talking

certainly believe I have a good-faith basis, along with
my co-counsel, to explore that subject, and try to see
how someone who is fifth in line to the British Throne
might have been able to use the contacts and power that
he has to influence a -- a -- a disposition in this --
in the Crime Victims’ Rights Act case that it would have
been favorable to one of his friends and potentially
favorable to himself.

Q. And -- and you have that view,
notwithstanding that the government had represented they
have no record of that?

A. They didn’t -- no, no, no, no. Let's not -~
not -- let's not slip and try to get me to admit
something that is not what the record reflects. The
government said they did not have documents. They did
not say that they didn't have any information along
those lines.

To the contrary: They asserted a whole
series of privileges every time we tried to get
information along these lines. So the fact that they
didn't have a letter, signed Prince Andrew, saying,
please do the best you can for this convicted sex
offender is one thing. That's the request for
production of documents.

But they never said that they -- they -- that

something along these lines had never happened and, to
the contrary, we were faced with assertions of privilege
over roughly, if I remember correctly, about 10,000
pages of documents where a whole host of privileges were
being asserted.

Q. ‘Do you think it's credible that the United
States Attorney's Office would be discussing an NPA with
a member of the British Royal Family?

A. Not directly, but there certainly are
possibilities of surrogates. I -- my -~ somebody who is
that powerful certainly wouldn't go out at it directly.
What they would probably do is try to find the best
lawyers they could around the United States and -- and,
you know, and some of the, you know, big-named lawyers
and try to bring them in there to -- to work a deal.
That's, I think, how, you know, we're -- you're
asking -- your question is asking for speculation and
I'm saying that -- that based on, how would you
influence a deal in an American criminal justice system?
You go try to get the best defense lawyers you could and
see -- you know -- you know, figure out which political
party was in power; and try to get people who are
well-connected to that political party, things like
that.

So that's the way that I think somebody might
