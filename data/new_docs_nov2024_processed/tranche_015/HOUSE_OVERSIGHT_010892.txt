DECLARATION OF
1. My name is RR and 1 was born in August, 1983.

Ds I am currently 31 years old.

3, I grew up in Palm Beach, Florida. When I was little, I loved animals and wanted
to be a veterinarian. But my life took a very different turn when adults began to be interested in
having sex with me.

4. In approximately 1999, when I was 15 years old, I met Ghislaine Maxwell. She is
the daughter of Robert Maxwell, who had been a wealthy publisher in Britain. Maxwell asked
that I come with her to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion for the purposes of teaching me how to
perform “massages” and to train me professionally in that area. Soon after that I went to
Epstein’s home in Palm Beach on EI Brillo Way.

5. From the first time I was taken to Epstein’s mansion that day, his motivations and
actions were sexual, as were Maxwell’s. My father was not allowed inside. I was brought up
some stairs. There was a naked guy, Epstein, on the table in the room. Epstein and Maxwell
forced me into sexual activity with Epstein. I was 15 years old at the time. He seemed to be in

his 40s or 50s. I was paid $200. I was driven home by one of Epstein’s employees.
