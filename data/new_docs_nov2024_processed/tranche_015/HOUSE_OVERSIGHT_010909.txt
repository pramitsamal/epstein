RE: FOIA Request
Dear Professor Dershowitz:

As you know, on April 6, 2015, a request was made to the United States Secret Service under the federal
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA; 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552), relating to the period 1/01/01 to 1/1/03, for any
and all shift logs, travel records, itineraries, reports and other records for USSS personnel traveling with
former President Bill Clinton to Little St. James Island and the US Virgin Islands” (Attachment A).

The basis of the above-described FOIA request was a claim by Virginia Roberts, in court papers filed in
early 2015 in Florida federal court, that she and former President Clinton were on Little St. James Island
at the same time during the 1/01/01 to 1/1/03 period.

As set forth in a January 16, 2016 letter from Kim E. Campbell, United States Secret service Special
Agent In Charge, Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Officer, the USSS has conducted a
reasonable search for responsive records. It appears, from a review of USSS main indices, that there are
no records pertaining to your request that are referenced in these indices (Attachment B).

I therefore conclude from this response that former President Clinton did not in fact travel to, nor was he
present on, Little St. James Island between January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2003.

Based upon my experience and knowledge of the duties, protocols and operations of USSS Protective
Details, the Special Agents accompany and escort former President Clinton 24 hours per day, and would
have certainly went with him to Little St. James Island during the period at issue. If the Agents had
accompanied the former President to that location, they would had been required to make and file shift
logs, travel vouchers and related documentation relating to the visit.

The total absence of any such records and documentation, in my opinion, strongly establishes that former
President Clinton was not present on Little St. James Island during the period at issue.

Best Regards,

Louie Freeh
