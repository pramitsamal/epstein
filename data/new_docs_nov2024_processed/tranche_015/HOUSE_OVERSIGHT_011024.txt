per unit time. But Petty showed that the idea of human capital as discounted cash
flow measured in a money sum allows the factors to be summed together. The
revival of interest at the Chicago school soon introduced the term physical capital
for land and man-made things that can be bought and sold, and total capital for the
sum. Physical capital is a misnomer in that we are physical too. But I have used it
throughout so that economists can follow me and general readers can pick up some

of their language.

From the Y = C +1 Equation to the Y Rule

Chapter 2 summarized my argument adjusting the Y = C + ] equation to the Y rule.
Chapter 4 spelled out the former in (4.1). The Y rule made the hidden asterisks of
the Y=C +1 equation explicit. | said in both chapters that the free growth equations

are the same for both when we allow for the asterisks.

Let’s go through the derivation of the Y rule again. (4.1) shows

output = investment + consumption.

I] generally mean the version of this where “ex post net” is understood before both
“output” and “investment”. | said that this idea is implicit in the Mill quote, and is
probably as old as economics. Net output, here or anywhere, means creation of
value. Then the equation would be guaranteed by the truism, at the collective scale,
if net investment meant growth of all value existing, meaning total capital, while
consumption meant elimination from total capital collectively and nothing else. But
net ex post investment as meant throughout this book, and anywhere in macro,
means growth in physical capital alone. Consumption includes Schultz’ invested
consumption transferred into human capital as well as his pure consumption

eliminated from total capital as a whole. What the truism guarantees is rather

output = total growth + pure consumption, (5.1)
