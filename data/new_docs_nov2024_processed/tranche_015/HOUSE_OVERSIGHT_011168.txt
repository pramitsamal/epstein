The result of this analysis is shown in figure 6, along with the age-20 curve from figure 5. It
shows that

e The long-term tendency is toward a rate of roughly 2% in all cases. Thus, conclusions about
the interest rate are unaffected by the difference between these models.

e When consumption affects survival (i.e. when y = 0), the curve differs little from that of the
earlier analysis.

e When consumption affects fertility, the discount function peaks in the late thirties and early
forties.

I’m not sure what to make of this. Perhaps:

e young people are prone to risk their lives in return for immediate gratification (fast driving,
sky diving, high crime rates), but middle aged people are more prone to take risks affecting
fertility.
