Dershowitz that we would then believe, in light of your ruling,

should be redacted. But until we have any rulings from your

Honor restricting the case, it's our position that all --

THE COURT: But you don't have an edited version of

the intervention motion that you would like me to consider.

7)

MR. CASSELL: We would propose one once we get rulings

from your Honor on the motions in limine.

=

THE COURT: By the way, just parenthetically, folks,

these motions in limine are good fun, and we're all having a

nice time, but they're not binding. I mean by that, I'm

expressing my view, or I will, I hope, some day express my view
on these issues, but the trial may turn in a different

direction and, you know, who knows. Okay.

r,

MR. CASSELL: We understand. And one of the reasons

we have not proposed a redacted joinder motion, that showed up
in a reply brief from the defendant, we didn't move to file a
surreply with a possible motion. We think the best way to
proceed, and we're happy to get guidance from your Honor, but

once we have rulings from you on what's in the case and what's

out, then we might go through the joinder motion. But where
we're sitting today, the joinder motion goes in in its

entirety.

But what does not come in is then, all right, that's a

legal pleading. Gee, I wonder what happened. Judge Marra made

a ruling, we don't need to get into the details of that ruling.
