Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Roberts.
Plaintiff's counsel has said statements made in the

newspaper articles are hearsay. That is often true, but when

it's plaintiff's statement in a news article, it's calleda
party admission.

Plaintiff complains that she didn't have the

opportunity to depose President Clinton. Your Honor,

plaintiff's counsel sought to depose President Clinton in their
reply brief at the end of June, 2016, about a week before
discovery was to close. They didn't even mention it in their

opening brief, they raised it in docket number 211.

In that request, which I didn't have an opportunity to
object to because it came in reply, she said she wanted to

depose him to, establish his close personal relationship with

Epstein, she said nothing about wanting to s whether he had
been on the island, whether he flew in a helicopter, or
anything like that.

With regard to Louie Freeh, your Honor, we disclosed

him as a witness in our Rule 26 disclosures last March --

xcuse m February of 2016. Plaintiff made no effort to try
to depose him, made no effort to find out his basis of
knowledge. We produced in discovery his report in which he
submitted a FOIA request.

Yesterday, you will recall Ms. McCawley testifying

about how she, herself, issued a FOIA request and got in
