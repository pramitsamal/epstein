to pick apart nuances in the statement. So, your Honor, I
submit that to you for what it doesn't say from Ms. Maxwell
since they've provided that to you today.

There are a few more things that I just want to touch

on that I think need to be clarified, and that is, with respect

to -- there was this mention about newspaper articles, and as

you know we've submitted an expert who analyzed through his web

analytics, he's the sam xpert that was in the Anders case who

followed that video of the Fox reporter over the internet and

tracked that he uses a well-accepted methodology. We've set

that forth all in our papers.

But he tracked the specific quoted statements, your

Honor. And if they have an issue, if they want to say, oh,

they're proposing today that these articles related to the

Dershowitz matter, that's subject for cross examination of him
if they want, but he has a very clear methodology, and those
articles that he tracked were in that manner, your Honor, so I
just want to make that point since they raised it. I know
we're not discussing the experts in detail today, but I did ask
that question.

So your Honor, in just summarizing on those points, I

think we made clear in our opening argument why we believe that

this shouldn't be subject to a number of mini trials ona

variety of these issues, we're hoping to streamline this

matter, and that's why we proposed this motion in limine to you
