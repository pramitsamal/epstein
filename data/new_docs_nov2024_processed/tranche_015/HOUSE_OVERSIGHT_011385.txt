concluded that was an inappropriate word.

The only let me be clear. If there's some document

that has the word prostitute in it, we're not suggesting that

somewhere, we're not sure exactly how they're going to

authenticate those, there's no evidence Ms. Giuffre has heard

of those, so as you say, we can take that up at the time. But

we would ask that defense counsel be instructed, and their

witnesses be instructed, not to use that term unless it appears
in a particular document.
With regard to item 14, this is the domestic violence

issue. And they say, look, it has relevance because it shows

an alternative cause of emotional distress damages.

Our position is primarily based on Rule 403. We

relevance that perhaps could be teased out here, but let's

understand, this domestic violence incident took place in

March, 2015, and the statement at issue that caused the
