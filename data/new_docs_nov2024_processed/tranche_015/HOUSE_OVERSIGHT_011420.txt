know -- she's holding these police reports and she says, I know
there is a police report. We go on 300 pages or so in the

deposition, and it is clear from the transcript that when we
get back to the police report issue again, Ms. Maxwell is being
asked questions by Ms. McCawley. Ms. McCawley says -- and this

is at page 169, lines 4 through 8 -- Now that you have the

police report that I showed you this morning that you had an

v

opportunity to look at it, and Ms. Maxwell responds, You gave

it to me. I did not look at it. And there was no really

other questioning at the deposition about Ms. Maxwell's

knowledge of these police reports.

So the record on this issue, your Honor, which is

going to continue to be the record, is that Ms. Maxwell has no

knowledge of this police report, the investigation, anything

that's going on with Mr. Epstein substantively during this

investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department. So that's

why it's not admissible. They try to cobble together what they

view as sort of indicia of she should have known about what's

in these police reports, and they first of all say -- we get

back to this Dershowitz joint defense agreement issue, which I
touched on yesterday, but you're going to hear it again today,
so I think it's worth mentioning again. And here are the

quotes exactly from Mr. Dershowitz' deposition.

Mr. Dershowitz -- somebody objects during this deposition, and

then there's a colloquy. There's an assertion of privilege.
