who handled this entire investigation and walked through each

of those people, your Honor, and walked through how he recorded

it in this document. So this is authenticated through

Detective Recarey, who is a witness in this trial, on our trial

exhibit list.

To be very clear, this document is so critical because
it mentions Maxwell in it. It talks about Maxwell's stationery
being at the house, it talks about other issues with respect to
Maxwell. When I asked her at her deposition and I gave her

this document -- and you can look at the testimony, your Honor,

we want you to look at the testimony -- she says: I've seen
it. Later in that deposition, they talk about her battling me

over she wouldn't look at certain things I gave her, in front

of her, right? So there was an attitude issue during that

deposition that I had to manage. And that was what was coming
up in that section. It wasn't that she didn't say she had seen
it. But your Honor, we are allowed to put that in front of

her, in front of the jury, and say: Did you know about this at

the time in 2005 when you were photographed kissing Epstein on
the day the investigation started? You were working for him.

You've admitted that. You didn't know about all these little

girls coming to the Palm Beach house that you were working at,

that you claim you were the house manager for? We should be

entitled to get this in --

THE COURT: That is for the truth of the matter.
