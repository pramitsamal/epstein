employee trainings on new values
and culture.

One of the largest banks signifi-
cantly improved public disclosures
by adopting new policies and
processes on ethics, and publicly
committing to high-quality prac-
tices to ensure financial stability
and economic opportunity.” At
the core of these efforts was the
goal to be client-oriented, with
accountability to stakeholders
and regulators alike.

It was in the areas of risk man-
agement and board oversight
that banks made the most visible
changes. They created risk com-
mittees at the board level and
implemented company-wide risk
management programs. For ex-
ample, we saw how a leading bank
in the U.S. also established a new
position of Chief Risk Officer
reporting to the board and tasked
with ensuring that incentive pro-
grams in the organization do not
encourage excessive or unneces-
sary risk-taking.”

One of the largest banks also
showed corporate leadership by
publicly acknowledging responsi-
bility for unethical practices and
recognizing past mistakes.” They
shifted their focus to identify
and monitor “material risk-tak-
ing” in their organization and
increased managerial oversight.
Other banks publicly committed
to seeking responsible business
growth and to conduct their busi-
ness in a more transparent way.”
