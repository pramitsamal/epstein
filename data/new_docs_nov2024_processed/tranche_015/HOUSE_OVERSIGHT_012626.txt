Talk to Jack Goldberger about this group. They are all very good personal injury lawyers, but I
have concerns about whether there would be an inherent tension because they may feel that
THEY might make more money (and get a lot more press coverage) if they proceed outside the
terms of the plea agreement. (Sorry — I just have a bias against plaintiffs’ attorneys.) One nice
thing about Bert i is that he is in Miami where there has been almost no coverage of this case.

Just so you know, I have never met Bert, but a good friend in our appellate section and one of the
district judges in Miami are good friends with him and recommended him.

Can you let me know tomorrow? I am going to be out for a while starting on Friday, and I
_ would like to get this underway before I leave.

Thank you.
