Piaget Meets Uncertain Inference

Full self modification

Capable of self-modification of internal structures
Able to carry out arbitary complex inferences (constrained
Formal only by computational resources) via including inference control
as an explicit subject of abstract learning

Able to carry out more complex chains of reasoning via using
Concrete inference control schemata that adapt behavior based on experience

(reasoning about a given case in a manner similar to prior cases)

Able to recognise patterns in and make inferences about the
Infantile world, but only using simplistic hard-wired (not experientially learned)

inference control schema.

An uncertain inference system, as we consider it here, consists of four components, which
work together in a feedback-control loop 11.3
