unanticipated results of analog and digital computer experiments were responsible

Modern Applied Dynamical Systems Emerged from Accidental
Computational Discoveries

A medical student named Herr, in his thesis research with the “radio
engineer’, Van der Pol (1926), was simulating cardiac electrophysiology with an
analog device which permitted real time, exploration of a full range of parameter
values long before there were fast enough digital processors to do so. Studying the
behavior of equations of a periodically, pace maker, driven, nonlinear triode
oscillator, Herr found orbital points that appeared to belong to two different periods
simultaneously thus violating the uniqueness of solutions of differential equation
theory. The Van der Pol relaxation oscillator equations, with their slow buildup and
sudden discharge of membrane potential are good models for the slow-fast
processes of repolarization and depolarization of Hodgkin-Huxley type equations
(Rinzel, 1985). Periodically driven, nonlinear differential equations of the Van der
Pol type are generally applicable to the multiplicity of dynamical regimes of neuronal
dynamics (Carpenter, 1979; Aihara et al, 1984; Chay and Rinzel, 1985) and, with
periodic and aperiodic driving and noise, can be made relevant to particular
mammalian neuronal subsystems in the context of clinically relevant global
electrophysiological phenomena such as Magoun’s (1954) brain stem evoked EEG
and behavioral arousal (Nicolis, 1986; Selz and Mandell, 1992; Mandell and Selz,
1993).

In the early 1940’s, using the pre-publication results of similar analog
computer studies (Levinson, 1949), the Cambridge mathematicians, Mary
Cartwright and Joe Littlewood (1945; McMurran, S., Tattersal, J.,1999) used
geometric methods to prove that the highly nonlinear, periodically driven Van der
Pol equations, depending upon one or two changing parameters, generated fixed
point (“homeostatic”), periodic (“cyclic”), subharmonic (“period doubling”),

quasiperiodic (“multiply periodic”), intermittent (“bursting”) and “deterministically
