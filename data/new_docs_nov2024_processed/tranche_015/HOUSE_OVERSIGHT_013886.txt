=> Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS

1. Get an assistant—even if you don’t need one.

Develop the comfort of commanding and not being commanded. Begin with a one-time test project or
small repetitive task (daily preferred). I advise using domestic help for language-intensive tasks and using
foreign assistants in the early stages to improve the general clarity of your communication. Pick one
from each group and get started.

The following sites, split up geographically, are useful resources.

U.S. and Canada ($20/hour+)
http://www.iavoa.com (International Association of Virtual Office Assistants). Global directory that
includes the U.S.

http://www.cvac.ca (Canadian Virtual Assistant Connection)

http://www.canadianva.net/files/va-locator.html (Canada)
www.onlinebusinessmanager.com

North America and International ($4/hour+)

www.elance.com (Search “virtual assistants,” “personal assistants,” and “executive assistants.”) The
client feedback reviews on Elance enabled me to find my best VA to date, who costs $4/hour. Similar
marketplaces with positive reviews include www.guru.com and www.rentacoder.com.

India

www.tryasksunday.com ($20-60 per month for 24/7 concierge, free one-week trial). AskSunday is one
of the sophisticated new kids on the personal outsourcing block. Their site was nominated the #2 website
of the year in 2007 by Time magazine. Just dial a 212 (NYC) area code and get routed to well-spoken
assistants in India and the Philippines. I use this service 80% of the time, as most tasks take less than 10
minues to complete. For longer projects, there are teams available for $12/hour.
