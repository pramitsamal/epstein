A/B Testing Software

Testing is, as you know, the name of the game, but testing all the variables can be confusing. How do
you know which combination of headlines, text, and images on your homepage results in the most sales?
Instead of using one version for a bit, then alternating, which is time-consuming, use software that serves
up different versions to prospects at random, then does the math for you.

= Google Website Optimizer (WO) ( http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer_)

This is a free tool that, like Google Analytics, is better than most paid services. I used Google WO to test
three potential homepages for www.dailyburn.com and increased sign-ups 19%, then again by more than
16%.

TollFreeMAX and Kall8 both allow you to set up toll-free numbers in 2-5 minutes. Calls can then be
forwarded to any other numbers, and voicemail and statistics can be managed online or via e-mail.
