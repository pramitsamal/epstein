Bua outsourcer takes a piece of the revenue pie. Here is what the general profit-loss might look like

for a hypothetical $80 product sold via phone and developed with the help of an expert, who is paid a
royalty. I recommend calculating profit margins using higher-than-anticipated expenses. This will
account for unforeseen costs (read: screwups) and miscellaneous fees such as monthly reports, etc.

REVENUE
Product cost $80.00
Shipping/Handling $12.95
Total Revenue $92.95
EXPENSES
Product manufacturing $10.00
Call center ($0.83 per minute x average

call time of 4 minutes) $3.32
Shipping $5.80
Fulfillment ($1.85 per package + $0.50 for

boxes/packing) $2.35
Credit card processing (2.75% of $92.95) $2.56
Returns + declined cards (6% of $92.95) $5.58
Royalties (5% of wholesale price of $48 [$80 = .6]) $2.40
Total expenses $32.01
PROFIT (revenue minus expenses) $60.94

How do you factor in advertising cost? If a $1,000 ad or $1,000 in PPC produces 50 sales, my
advertising cost per order (CPO) is $20. This makes the actual‘ per-unit profit $40.94.

I set a new goal after that experience, and when I was interviewed six months later as a follow-up, one
change was more pronounced than all others: silence. I had redesigned the business from the ground up
so that I had no phone calls to answer and no e-mail to respond to.

I’m often asked how big my company is—how many people I employ full-time. The answer is one.
Most people lose interest at that point. If someone were to ask me how many people run Brain-

QUICKEN LLC, on the other hand, the answer is different: between 200 and 300. I am the ghost in the

machine 22

From advertisements—print in this example—to a cash deposit in my bank account, the diagram is
what a simplified version of my architecture looks like, including some sample costs. If you have
developed a product based on the guidelines in the last two chapters, it will plug into this structure hand-
in-glove.

Where am I in the diagram? Nowhere.

I am not a tollbooth through which anything needs to pass. I am more like a police officer on the side
of the road who can step in if need be, and I use detailed reports from outsourcers to ensure the cogs are
moving as intended. I check reports from fulfillment each Monday and monthly reports from the same
the first of each month. The latter reports include orders received from the call center, which I can
compare to the call center bills to gauge profit. Otherwise, I just check bank accounts online on the first
and fifteenth of each month to look for odd deductions. If I find something, one e-mail will fix it, and if
not, it’s back to kendo, painting, hiking, or whatever I happen to be doing at the time.
