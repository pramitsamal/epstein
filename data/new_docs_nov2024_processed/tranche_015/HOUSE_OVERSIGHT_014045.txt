system.” It extended broad rights to crime victims, including “[t]he right
to be treated with faimess and with respect for the victim’s dignity and
privacy”” and “[t]he reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the
Government in the case.”*° It also commanded that these rights must be
afforded by the Justice Department “and other departments and agencies of

Congress appeared to have at least two goals in mind in passing the
CVRA. The first was simply to ensure that crime victims understood what

the fact that the CVRA gives crime victims rights to notification about
various court hearings, as well as more general nghts to confer with
prosecutors and to be treated with fairness.*° The CVRA’s Senate sponsors

and by a court system that simply did not have a place for them.*!

In passing the CVRA, Congress sought to change the system’s

A second overarching purpose of the CVRA was to allow crime

Congress intended to make victims “independent participant[s]” in the
criminal justice process.** The CVRA extends to crime victims a series of
“rights” in the criminal justice process—rights that the victims have
