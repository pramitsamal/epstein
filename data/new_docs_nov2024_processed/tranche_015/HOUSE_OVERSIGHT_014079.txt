Other states also expressly extend nights before the filing of charges.
Colorado guarantees rights at “all critical stages of the criminal justice
process|,]” which includes both the filing of charges and the decision to not
file charges.”*> In Missoun, victims have the right:

on charged cases or submitted cases where no charge decision has yet been made, to
be informed by the prosecuting attorney of the status of the case and of the availability
[of different forms of compensation and assistance] and of any final decision by the
prosecuting attorney not to file charges.”*°

In New Jersey, officials typically send a letter informing the victim “that the
case has been referred to the prosecutors’ office and explains and offers the
services available from the country office of victim-witness advocacy.””*’
Subsequent letters to the victim ensure that the victim has notice of a series
of decisions long before indictment,”* and the office actively solicits
information in order to “help the prosecutor’s office decide whether or not
to prosecute a case.””*? Along a similar vein, the Massachusetts legislature
included a provision that makes it clear that nothing should prevent a
prosecutor from providing victim services to persons injured by the
commission of a crime, even though a complaint or indictment has not yet
been issued.*”°

In addition to extending nghts before the filing of charges, several
states require consultation before the prosecutor reaches a plea agreement
with the defendant. For example, Idaho’s statute provides that a victim
must be given an opportunity “to communicate with the prosecution in
criminal or juvenile offenses, and be advised of any proposed plea
agreement by the prosecuting attorney prior to entering into a plea
agreement in criminal or juvenile offenses involving crimes of violence, sex
