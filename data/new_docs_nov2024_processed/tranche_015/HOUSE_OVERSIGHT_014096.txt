Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Production of Documents

Response to Requests for Production 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23.
To permit the Court to review the extent of Dershowitz’s evasions, a copy of his responses is
attached to this pleading as Exhibit A.

In short, despite having had 45 days to gather materials that allegedly provide “absolute
proof” that he has never even met Jane Doe No. 3 — and despite having told numerous media
sources that he had already collected such information — Dershowitz has produced none of these
documents to Edwards and Cassell. He has also made blanket assertions of a variety of
privileges, but has produced no privilege logs.

CONCLUSION

Accordingly, Edwards and Cassell request:

1. That Dershowitz be directed to produce all materials covered by the discovery
requests forthwith;

2. That Dershowitz be held to have waived any and all otherwise applicable privileges as
a consequence of his failure to timely file a privilege log; and

3. That Dershowitz be ordered to pay reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees associated
with the need to file this motion to compel.

CERTIFICATE OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO RESOLVE

Plaintiffs have attempted in good faith to resolve the discovery issues presented in this

motion (and others) as evidenced by the letter attached as Exhibit B. The Defendant has failed to

respond as of the time of the filing of this motion.
