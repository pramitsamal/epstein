To be sure, there are good reasons to be
cautious, as we discussed in Section I, The Risks to
Our Outlook. Even worse, investors are exposed to
these dangers at a time when most asset valuations
are expensive by historical standards, providing
them with a narrow margin of safety to absorb
such adverse developments. This is particularly
true in the US, where valuations have been cheaper
at least 90% of the time historically.’ Even in
Europe, where valuations are more attractive, that
fact is counterbalanced by greater geopolitical risks
and deeper structural fault lines.

Still, as we highlighted in Section I of this
Outlook, there are three reasons why remaining
invested in risk assets is still warranted despite
what are likely to be uninspiring returns. First,
we see only a 15% probability of a US recession,
which has historically been the key driver of
losses in risk assets. Indeed, the S&P 500 has
generated positive annual total returns 86% of
the time during economic expansions in the post-
WWII period. Second, the comparable returns
of investment alternatives—such as cash and
bonds—are unappealing, particularly in the rising
interest rate environment that we expect. Third,
risk assets can surprise us to the upside, as last year
demonstrated. The potential for returns to exceed
our expectations is especially true in the US, given
the possibility of tax reforms, fiscal expansion
and deregulation. The same could be said for
our tactical positions across various asset classes,
which we discussed in Section I, Our Tactical Tilts.

While we have suggested that the dilemma
should be resolved in favor of remaining invested,
we are not Pollyannaish. Investors have ridden
this bull market for eight years, and while we
don’t expect the ride to end in 2017, we must stay
vigilant to avoid the horns.

Note: Based on 5 valuation metrics for the S&P 500, beginning in September 1945: Price/Trend
Earnings, Price/Peak Earnings, Price/Trailing 12m Earnings, Shiller Cyclically Adjusted Price/
Earnings Ratio (CAPE) and Price/10-Year Average Earnings. These metrics are ranked from least
expensive to most expensive and divided into 10 valuation buckets (“deciles”). The subsequent
realized, annualized 5-year price return is then calculated for each observation and averaged
within each decile. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

US Equities: Life in the Fast Lane

US stocks have been driving in the fast lane since
2009. Over this nearly eight-year period, the S&P
500 has generated a stunning 16.5% annualized
price return, a pace exceeded only 3% of the time
since 1945. As a result, the 500 companies in the
index are collectively worth $20 trillion today,
about 3.5 times as high as they were at the trough
of the financial crisis. Needless to say, investors
have had a good ride.

Yet such a fast drive also raises the question of
whether US equities are now running on empty.
