On the other hand, a harsher US stance on trade
and foreign policy would hurt emerging market
earnings, sentiment and valuation multiples.
China, Korea, Mexico and Taiwan—which
account for about 60% of MSCI emerging market
capitalization and earnings—seem particularly
vulnerable in the latter scenario. In comparison,
countries with less exposure to the US economy
and already strong domestic demand, such as India
and Indonesia, would likely fare better.

Exhibit 70: 2016 Currency Moves (vs. US Dollar)

Against this uncertain backdrop and
considering today's uninspiring valuations (see
Exhibit 69), we remain tactically neutral on
emerging market equities. That said, we continue
to explore relative investment opportunities that
exploit the significant domestic activity, external
vulnerability and valuation differences among
individual emerging countries.

2017 Global Currency Outlook

In a notable departure from recent years, the
US dollar did not enjoy unequivocal dominance
in 2016 (see Exhibit 70). The yen, for example,
ended a four-year slide against the greenback as
the market questioned the BOJ’s commitment
to monetary easing. Certain emerging market
currencies—such as the Russian ruble and Brazilian
real—also outperformed the dollar on the back of
stronger commodity prices and favorable political
developments at home. And while the dollar did
make notable gains against the euro, pound and
Mexican peso in particular, these currencies enter
2017 with a more balanced risk/reward profile
as a result.

The upshot is that while tightening monetary
policy and potential fiscal expansion in the US
will continue to favor dollar strength, those
gains are likely to be more modest and reflected
in a narrower set of currencies as the dollar bull
market enters its fifth year. Our tactical positioning

For the first time in several years, the US dollar did not appreciate against all major currencies.
