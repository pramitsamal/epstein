As a New Yorker from humble beginnings, Jeffrey Epstein played on his blue-collar credentials and
enormous wealth to extend tentacles of influence throughout America’s liberal political elite.During the
outcry over the Epstein case, it emerged that another man with a notorious appetite for young women,
Bill Clinton, travelled with Epstein to a number of destinations, including three times on the billionaire’s
private aircraft.On one occasion, Epstein flew the former President, Hollywood actor and staunch
Democrat Kevin Spacey and another actor friend of Mr Clinton’s, Chris Tucker, to Africa, to ‘discuss AIDS

policy’.
