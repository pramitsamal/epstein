investigate the backgrounds of the girls.Detectives painstakingly built a case which they believed showed
that Epstein systematically paid teenage girls to recruit other teenage girls to his sex ring. However, as
the investigation continued, they found that Epstein’s team had already spoken to key witnesses,
suggesting that the financier would reward those who helped him.|n addition, Epstein’s defence team
agreed to the unusual move of suggesting that the alleged victims sue Epstein in the civil courts. The
result was a plea bargain in which Epstein admitted a single charge of soliciting an underage girl for
prostitution — a deal which infuriated many police officers who worked on the case.More than 20 of
Epstein’s girls are said to have sued him for damages. At least 17 have settled out of court.Mr Clinton,
Mr Gore and Mr Mitchell were all contacted about their friendship with Epstein but declined to comment.
