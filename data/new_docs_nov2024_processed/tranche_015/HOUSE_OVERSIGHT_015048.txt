Sex Education For the Modern Catholic Child

This is a diaphragm. Women use it when they don’ t want to have a

baby. That is very immoral. Why, you ask? Because it is artificial, that’ s
why. But never fear. There are other methods to prevent conception. They
are very moral. Why, you ask? Because they are natural, that’ s why.

This is big brother’ s pajama bottoms. He had a nocturnal emission
last night. What a shame. It woke him up. But see the semen stain. It has
millions of dead sperms. They were killed the natural way.

This is his sister’ s sanitary napkin. It doesn’ t look very sanitary any
more, does it? There is an ovum somewhere in that bloody mess. But it will
never be fertilized. It will be flushed down the toilet bowl. That’ s the
natural way, too.

This is a baby. It was born dead. Every day in the U.S.A., 136,000
infants are stillborn or die within a month. Now suppose their Mommies
and Daddies had interfered artificially with the process of procreation.
God’ s purpose would never have been achieved. Just think what a
tragedy that would’ ve been. But at least some of the dead babies were

baptized. That’ s the natural way.
