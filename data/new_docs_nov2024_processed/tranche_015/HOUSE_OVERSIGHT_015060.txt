“There can be single justified cases,” he rationalized, “for
example, when a prostitute uses a condom, and this can be a first step
toward a moralization, a first act of responsibility in developing anew an
awareness of the fact that not everything is permissible and that we
cannot do everything we want. However, this is not the best way to
overcome the infection of HIV. It is really necessary to humanize
sexuality.”

Daniel Maguire, author of Sacred Rights: The Case for Contraception
and Abortion in World Religions, observed that the pope’ s change in
policy represents a significant “crack in the dike” of Catholic opposition
to condom use. The opposition stems from Catholic dogma that sex is for
reproduction, and nothing should interfere with that.

An issue of 7he Realist reprinted an article from the London
Observer, which began: “Three Roman Catholic theologians have
expressed the opinion that, in times of revolution and violence, it is lawful
for women, particularly for nuns, to take contraceptive pills and
precautions against the danger of becoming pregnant through rape.”

On that same page was our Rumor of the Month. So-called

‘flying saucers’ are actually diaphragms being dropped by nuns on their

way to Heaven.”
