chapters with Haldeman—this was not ghostwritten material because |
rewrote what they presented—and Haldeman worked mostly on the Alger
Hiss chapter.

He was apparently so eager to please, though, that he screwed up
on his research. He had it that the FBI found the old Woodstock
typewriter. And the book was published that way. Then the facts came out,
the trial records and all, and we had to change it for the paperback edition.
So now it reads that the FBI was unab/e to find the typewriter.

The truth is, Alger Hiss found it himself. But the FBI had p/anted this
fake Woodstock typewriter. And then the defense presented it in the trial
as what they assumed was evidence in their favor. So a least Hiss was
found guilty of perjury.

That verdict added immeasurably to my political strength. | had the
courage of Alger Hiss’ s conviction and it served as the magic carpet that
transported me from the Congress to the Senate to the vice presidency. |
would have had the presidency in my pocket if not for Kennedy’ s
performance in the Great Debates—but only on television; | fared better
on radio. Kennedy’ s charisma was the variable that none of us had

counted on.
