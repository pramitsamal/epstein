There was one plan of the White House Plumbers that never came
to fruition. It involved the theft of Patricia Ellsberg’ s dental records. This
was my own idea—not Haldeman’ s, not Hunt’ s, not Liddy’ s—they
were satisfied with obtaining the records of Daniel Ellsberg’ s psychiatrist.

But | remembered that the first time Alger Hiss confronted
Whittaker Chambers, he requested to see his teeth. Hiss explained to me
that he suspected Chambers might be someone he had known years
before, and he wanted to see his teeth to make sure.

Well, that recollection inspired me. We were able to obtain the
dental records of Ellsberg’ s wife, all right, but did not have the
Opportunity to use them in helping to prove that she was guilty of
espionage. | could not imagine exactly how we were going to achieve this
but | did know that, whatever, it would be accepted by the public simply
because the charge itself was so “off the wall.”

How odd that Whittaker Chambers, the dignified translator of
Bambi, had been asked to publicly show his teeth as if he were some kind

of stud at a horse show. | have never been able to forget that moment.
