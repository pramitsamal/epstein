growing, selling, consuming and outlawing of illegal drugs around the
world is a complex mix of economics, politics and world culture.

There are silly conspiracies. Some folks believe that the moon
landing was faked (those were close-up photos of oatmeal). Others believe
that the Woodstock Festival never occurred (it was contrived by the
media). Still others believe that Elvis Presley’ s death was fabricated (he’ s
alive in Las Vegas, working as an Elvis impersonator). And surely there
must be others who are convinced that militant vegetarian activists are
responsible for Mad Cow disease.

Sometimes silly conspiracists get results. In 1995, Indiana
transportation officials were forced to alter the maintenance codes marked
on the back of highway signs because some state residents were
convinced that the markings were coded messages designed to assist
invading UN troops.

And there are serious conspiracies. Gasoline refiners conspire to limit
supply and fix prices. The relationship between doctors and
pharmaceutical companies is blatantly conspiratorial. Douglas Valentine
wrote in 7he Phoenix Program (about the CIA’ s notorious terrorist
campaign against Vietnamese villagers) that in 1968 the Army’ s 111th

Military Intelligence Group kept Martin Luther King under 24-hours-a-day
