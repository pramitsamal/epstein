before the Internet, the dead pool was slowly emerging from the shadows
of our culture.”

As with dead pools, ranging from business offices to Howard
Stern’ s radio show, that book is a guide to profiting from money bets.
But members of The Game play solely for the fun of it. Whoever has the
most points at the end of the year wins-- “bragging rights only” —slightly
ironic since Gamesters (lawyers, ad people, educators, psychology
professors, writers, everyday working folks) all play under aliases like
Frozen Stiff, Fade to Black, Worm Feast, Decomposers, 2 Dead Crew,
Johnny B. Dead, Wm. Randolph Hearse, Daisy Pusher, Silk Shroud,
Necrophiliac Pimp, Legion of Doom, Gang Green, Habeas Corpse, Die-
Uretic, Shovelin’ Off, Blunt Instrument, Rig R. Mortis, Flatliners,
Unplugged, Toe Tag, Clean Underwear and Gratefully Dead.

One couple, the Moorebids, insist, “We play for honor, not
bragging rights. It has to do with honoring who you get the hit on.”

Another player told me, “Il compare playing The Game to my day
job, science. We do a lot of data collection and data analysis; play our
hunches. Our reward is not financial, but peer recognition. One selects
some names to acknowledge the person. Other names are selected

because earning you points is their last opportunity to do something
