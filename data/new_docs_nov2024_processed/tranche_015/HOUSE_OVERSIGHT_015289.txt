returned to sender on the claim they appeared to be for a course. MAPS
[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]--their publication
was sent back several times because maps are not allowed in here. High

offending ‘propaganda’ included commentary by such extremists as Bill
Moyers and Ellen Goodman, and included an article published in
Reader’ s Digest. The common thread was that they all questioned the

wisdom of government policy.”
