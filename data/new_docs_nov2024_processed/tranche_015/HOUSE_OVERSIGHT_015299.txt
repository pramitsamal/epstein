Moreover, McCaffrey’ s proposal smacks of subliminal racism. Social
psychologist Walli Leff tells me, “I think most of the movement to involve
young people in chess is directed toward the African-American
community, and the assumption Is, if the kids are black they’ re going to
be drug users. | think white middle-class suburban parents would have a fit
if their kids had to take drug tests for their extracurricular activities. Or am
| out of it and am _| missing a new, white middle-class suburban
submissiveness?”

McCaffrey had been influenced by Chesschild, a group sponsored by
the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). Chesschild is a
substance abuse prevention program conducted in libraries and schools,
promoting a combination of drug-free lifestyles and chess.

“Policy recommendations like this one from ONDCP,” said St.
Pierre, “demonstrate a deep and disturbing pathology that goes well
beyond opposing drug-law reform efforts.”

Maybe the drug-law reformers should follow the example of gay-
