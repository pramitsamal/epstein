funny and laugh uproariously. A few minutes later, you could tell the
same joke and he would find it just as funny as the first time. For him,
every time was the first time, because he had lost the ability to record
long-term memories. The syndrome is wonderfully depicted in the film
50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Another
patient with specific stroke damage was unable to recall the names of
fruits but, oddly, could still name vegetables. Interestingly tomatoes
presented a particular problem. He had probably never known how to
catalogue them so they were partially remembered in both areas.

There are many such medical cases. In Oliver Sachs’ The Man who
Mistook his Wife for a Hat, the author relates the tale of a man with visual
agnosia who could not reliably name familiar objects, including his own
wife! He had a perfectly loving relationship with her but simply could
not name her from a picture. Sachs, Professor of Neurology at New York
University School of Medicine, provides many such fascinating stories,
along with their medical backgrounds.

The fruit and vegetable case suggests our brains are organized like a
filing cabinet. When we damage a part of the brain, it’s like losing a drawer:
All the information stored in that drawer is lost. Quite a few experiments
contradict this model and indicate many tasks are distributed around the
brain. The curious case of blindsight is one such example. People with
a damaged visual cortex can often recognize objects despite reporting
they have no sensation of vision. Show them a shape and they will report
they can see nothing. Ask them to name the shape and they might even
get a little irritated by the question; they are blind after all. But, ask them
to guess the shape and they will get it right every time. Seeing is more
