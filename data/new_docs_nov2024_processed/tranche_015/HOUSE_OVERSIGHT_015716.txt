If you think Eliza a bit odd, you are right. Perhaps you won't hire
her just yet. The program looks for keywords in speech, and parrots them
back at you interspersed with a few stock phrases. If you type a sentence
containing the word “job”, the computer will say, “Tell me more about
your job? It’s a simple program and runs to only three pages of text. It
shows how good a job you can do with very few resources and how far we
are away from a real human being. More complex programs with a larger
repertoire have been built and can hold a plausible conversation. People
are occasionally taken in by them and are quite shocked when told they
have been conversing with a machine. If you’re on your guard, they are
easy to spot. So far, no one has built a computer capable of holding an
extended human conversation and fooling a human into thinking it’s a
person. Incidentally, having a sympathetic listener is so important to
human beings these programs are used in psychotherapy and can be as
effective as drugs.

Turing proposed a test to tell whether a computer had truly achieved
human intelligence called the imitation game. His argument is as follows:
