The Hardest Problems

You probably hope cracking the encryption used to secure the Internet
is one of the hardest problems known to man but I’m sorry to tell you
it is not. When you use your credit card to buy something from an
online shop, your web browser changes from http to https, the ‘s’ stands
for secure. The data you send to the Internet is coded using a system
developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman
of MIT, which is why it is called RSA encryption. Any information you
send is raised to the power of a very large number - usually around
one hundred digits long. Raising something to the power simply means
multiplying it by itself that many times.

What makes decrypting a message hard is that division is a slow
process; it is called ‘long divisiow for a reason. It turns out there is no
way to speed it up on a conventional computer so, unless you know the
right number to divide by you will have to try every number. It is this that
makes decrypting RSA messages hard.

Although RSA messages are difficult to decipher, they are nowhere
near the hardest problems. That accolade is commonly believed to go
to non-deterministic polynomial problems known as ‘NP’ problems.
NP problems are easy to describe but fiendishly difficult to solve.
Nondeterministic means each time you come to a branch in the problem
there is no way to tell which branch is the best to pursue without exploring
it all the way to the end. It’s the same as a maze; at each junction in the
maze you can decide which path to take, but the junction gives you no
