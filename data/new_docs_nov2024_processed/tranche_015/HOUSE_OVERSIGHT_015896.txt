206 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

If humans used a formal system to think, they would be limited by
the incompleteness theorem and unable to discover new theorems that
required them to extend the formal rules. Humans do not appear to have
such a limitation and regularly extend their appreciation of mathematics
by expanding the rules, and seeing through to the truth.

Many scientists dislike this argument and think it farfetched, saying
there is no evidence to show people see past the limitation. Our brains
could be following a formal system capable of discovering everything we
have discovered to date or, indeed, might encounter in the future. Why
should we assume human minds are constrained in the same way as the
mathematical systems they discover? There is no evidence to suggest a
human thinking about Peano arithmetic is running a Peano based model
in their head. When Peano discovered his theorem he was certainly
extending our mathematical knowledge, but this does not imply he was
extending the capability of his brain.

The critics of Lucas and Penrose have one big problem to deal with.
The formal system in our head would need to be able to see the truth in
everything we could ever encounter. But, our formal system appears to
be small. As infants, it is almost nonexistent. Where does this enormous
system come from? It can’t come from our parents because they have
the same problem; they were once children. You might argue that the
capability of the human brain is huge and we can learn from all the other
humans on earth, but let me remind you what Godel said. However large
