Purists may protest that Fermat’s Last Theorem isn't strictly
Diophantine because it refers to a variable exponent — the x to the n
part. This is hair splitting. But, of course, the splitting of hairs is bread
and butter to a mathematician. We will see later that Fermat’s Theorem
can be made Diophantine, but we are jumping ahead of ourselves a little.

A question that taxed mathematicians for many centuries was
whether there are triples for higher powers, such as cubes. In other words,
would the cube of the hypotenuse be equal to the sum of the cubes of the
other two sides for some set of numbers? After much work, it was proven
no triple exists which can solve the cubic equation. But what happens if
we substitute higher indices?

The next shape to consider is the hypercube — a four-dimensional
cube. That may stretch your visual imagination but the equation is simple,
