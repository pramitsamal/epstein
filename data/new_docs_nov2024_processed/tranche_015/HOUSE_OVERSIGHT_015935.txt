Halting Flowchart

Now we create a third program called RunMe. RunMe runs
Haltcrash on itself. Still following this? Now execute RunMe with RunMe
as its own input. What happens? The analysis is as follows:

1. RUNME started on input RUNME halts. If RUNME started on
RUMME halts, then Haltcrash started on RUNME with input
RUNME halts. If Haltcrash started on RUNME with input
RUNME halts, then HALT decided that RUNME started on
RUNME does not halt!

Therefore,

RUNME started on input RUNME halts implies that RUNME
started on input RUNME does not halt. (contradiction)

2. RUNME started on input RUNME does not halt. If RUNME
started on RUNME does not halt, then Haltcrash started on
RUNME with input RUNME does not halt. If Haltcrash started
on RUNME with input RUNME does not halt, then Halt decided
that RUNME started on RUNME halts!

Therefore,

RUNME started on input RUNME does not halt implies that
RUMME started on input RUNME halts. (contradiction)
