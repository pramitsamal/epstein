I met Seth Lloyd in the late 1980s, when new ways of thinking were everywhere: the
importance of biological organizing principles, the computational view of mathematics
and physical processes, the emphasis on parallel networks, the importance of nonlinear
dynamics, the new understanding of chaos, connectionist ideas, neural networks, and
parallel distributive processing. The advances in computation during that period
provided us with a new way of thinking about knowledge.

Seth likes to refer to himself as a quantum mechanic. He is internationally known
jor his work in the field of quantum computation, which attempts to harness the exotic
properties of quantum theory, like superposition and entanglement, to solve problems
that would take several lifetimes to solve on classical computers.

In the essay that follows, he traces the history of information theory from Norbert
Wiener ’s prophetic insights to the predictions of a technological “singularity” that some
would have us believe will supplant the human species. His takeaway on the recent
programming method known as deep learning is to call for a more modest set of
expectations; he notes that despite AI’s enormous advances, robots “still can’t tie their
own shoes.”

It’s difficult for me to talk about Seth without referencing his relationship with his
friend and professor, the late theoretical physicist Heinz Pagels of Rockefeller
University. The graduate student and the professor each had a profound effect on each
other’s ideas.

In the summer of 1988, I visited Heinz and Seth at the Aspen Center for Physics.
Their joint work on the subject of complexity was featured in the current issue of
Scientific American; they were ebullient. That was just two weeks before Heinz’s tragic
death in a hiking accident while descending Pyramid Peak with Seth. They were talking
about quantum computing.
