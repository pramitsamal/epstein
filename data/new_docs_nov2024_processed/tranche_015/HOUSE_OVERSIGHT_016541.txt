prosecutors to reverse their earlier non-prosecution decisions (or, occasionally, to appointing substitute prosecutors). This
executive separation of powers model has proven effective, although whether it is effective enough is debated; it depends on
whether all cases of police violence that should have been prosecuted - based on the evidence and the public interest in
enforcement - were prosecuted. State and federal prosecution offices have distinct professional cultures and are responsive to
different constituencies and modes of political supervision, which increases the independence of one from the other. 7!? On the
other hand, federal prosecution is still to some degree political; it varies with the policy priorities of presidential administrations
714 to a degree that judicial review [*907] (in theory) should not. When there is less federal commitment to oversight of states’
approaches to police violence, enforcement redundancy is weak. 7!° Victims and other interested parties have no other
recourse.

C. Underenforcement and Prosecutor Political Accountability

In short, U.S. strategies of enforcement redundancy have a relatively strong track record for some crimes such as public
corruption, are robust but vulnerable to political shifts for others such as a police violence, and are notably weak with regard to
certain offenses, such as sexual assaults. That last category is important because that weakness extends well beyond sexual
assault offenses; many of the routine crimes that make up typical state criminal dockets are not within the scope of federal
criminal law enforcement. And since private prosecution and judicial or administrative review of prosecutorial decisions are
almost completely absent from state criminal justice systems, there is no charging-decision oversight of state prosecutors’
declination decisions and enforcement policies - save for local electoral accountability. In forty-five of fifty states, chief
prosecutors are directly elected in local constituencies. *!© This form of democratic accountability operates as a kind of check
on underenforcement, although it has significant limits in its capacity to play that role.

State prosecutors’ elected status is likely the best explanation [*908] for why victim-based checks on declination - private
prosecution or judicial review - never became a part of victims' rights reforms enacted in U-S. jurisdictions in recent decades.
First, prosecutors are politically powerful groups with legislatures, and they zealously guard their unfettered discretion over
criminal charging. *!7 Second, it has led even courts to disfavor any degree of judicial review of charging decisions, on the

142 The arguable exceptions are federal crimes for race-based and civil rights-related violence and for local officials’ abuses of power; in
those realms federal authorities responded to widespread failures by state law enforcement and justice systems. See generally Michal R.

the federal response to southern violence in mid-twentieth century); Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones, The FBI: A History 19-24 (2007) (tracing FBI to
nineteenth century federal efforts to combat Ku Klux Klan terrorism of voters); William J. Stuntz, The Collapse of American Criminal Justice
