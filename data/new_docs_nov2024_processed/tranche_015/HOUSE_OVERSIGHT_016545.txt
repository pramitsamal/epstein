163 See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1346 (2012) (criminalizing honest services fraud). The statute was enacted in 1988 in response to the Supreme
Court's 1987 decision in United States v. McNally, which held that 78 U.S.C. § 1341 did not cover honest services fraud. Gaioni, supra note
162, at 243 n.192.

164 See, e.g., Perrin, 444 U.S. at 50 (finding that section 1952 reflects congressional intent to alter the federal-state balance in order to
reinforce state law enforcement).

444 U.S. at 50 (In defining unlawful activity’ [in 78 U.S.C. § 1952], Congress has clearly stated its intention to include violations of state as
well as federal bribery law.); United States v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081, 1092-1103 (10th Cir. 2003) (reinstating an indictment and holding that
Utah law serves as predicate to define violations of JS U.S.C. § 1952).

clearance rates for homicides - meaning the percentage of cases police resolve, usually by arrest - are higher for homicides than other offense
categories. See 2016 Crime in the United States, FBI: UCR, /ttps://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/201 6/crime-in-the-u.s.-201 6/tables/table-17

and 18.3% for property crimes).

twice as many rapes as the NCVS survey reported for the same year). See generally Candace Kruttschnitt et al., Estimating the Incidence of
