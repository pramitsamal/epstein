Ordinances, cleared land must be re-sodded or replanted to prevent the creation of
windblown dust or dirt and Chapter 42, Section 42-86, unsightly, unsafe or
unsanitary conditions not permitted and properties to be maintained in good
condition.

Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said the
violation was discovered on routine patrol. Mr. Weymer has been in contact with
a property representative, Louis Pascerelli who said Mr. Horton had not been in
Town to receive his mail. Mr. Weymer said Mr. Pascerelli had proposals from
Hansen Landscape for the clean up and re-sod of the lot and a weekly maintenance
contract to assure this does not happen again. Tropical Irrigation has also been
contacted to put in a new irrigation system. The Town recommends a finding of
non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and the property
owner given until August 18, 2008 to come into compliance. Mr. Fried said he
believed a fine of some sort should be imposed. Mr. Ballentine asked how long
Mr. Horton had been out of compliance. Mr. Weymer said the original warning
was sent out on June 5, 2008 and a notice of violation and hearing was sent out on
June 20, 2008. Mr. Weymer said the first contact with him was July 7, 2008. Mr.
Ballentine asked if the August compliance date was reasonable and Mr. Weymer
said Jim Hansen of Hansen Landscape thought it would be done before that date
but he wanted more time in case he ran into any problems.

MOTION BY MR. FRIED TO FIND THE VIOLATOR IN NON-
COMPLIANCE, ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE AMOUNT
OF $150.00 AND GIVE HIM UNTIL AUGUST 18, 2008 TO COME INTO
