Martha Stewart

I knew Martha Stewart in law school. Her then husband was my classmate. When she got in
trouble, she called me and we discussed her situation. She had been indicted for acts she was
accused of committing after she retained top flight lawyers. She then hired another top flight
lawyer, Robert Murcalo, to represent her. He did a terrible job and she was convicted. She went
to jail largely as the result of the lawyers she had picked. By the time she called me, it was too
late to do very much. She picked excellent lawyers for her appeal and I consulted with them, but
the court affirmed her conviction and she went off to serve her relatively short prison sentence.
She has now rebounded and her conviction will be a small footnote in her otherwise successful
and productive life.
