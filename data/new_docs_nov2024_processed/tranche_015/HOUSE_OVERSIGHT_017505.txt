6 A. Yes. £6

9 MR. SCAROLA: First I'm going to object to 2 9

12 Q. The question is, does that refresh your [ 12
13 _ recollection as to whether or not this meeting took : 13
14 place? 14
15 A. To the best of my recollection, ] actually £15
16 had introduced some of the investors to some of the 16
17 people working on the Epstein case, and that is likely i 17
f18 the meeting that you are referring to. But for the £18
19 life of me, ] don't have a specific recollection of £19
20 it. £20
f2i Q. But it could be the meeting where you 21
22 introduced the Epstein litigation team to your Ponzi £22
23 investors? £23
24 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, I'm going to 24
25 object to the form of the question. It misstates the £25

6 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, counsel. The | 6

7 testimony was that there may have been a meeting at | 7

8 which investors may have been introduced to some i 8

9 people working on the Epstein file. And your efforts | 9
10 continuously to mischaracterize the prior testimony 210
11° are highly improper. I object. | 11

13 Q. Scott, did you or did you not say that you p13
14 — introduced some of the investors to some of the 214
15 Jawyers on the Epstein case? £15
16 ~ A. No, J actually said, Tonja, that ] may have. £16
17 J have a recollection that | may have based upon you : 17
18 just refreshing my recollection, but] just do not ' 18
19 remember one way or the other. This was, in the : 19
20 scheme of what | was doing, insignificant. ] was 22 0
21 _ simply trying to establish to the investors that this £21
22 was areal case, with real potential, with real | 22
23  Jawyers working on it. Other than that, it was of no 23
24 interest to me. 24
25 Q. How else would you convince them? You've | 25

mentioned letting them look through the litigation
boxes, you've mentioned the meeting. What other way
would Id you have convinced them that it was a real case?
“A. I mentioned letting th letting them look at boxes, what
they did when ] was out of the office, that's -- ]
don't know because | couldn't see what they were
doing. Number two, ] may have introduced them to
people in the office. Number three, I'm certain that
when the people brought the boxes to my office ]
introduced them to whoever was carrying the boxes.

And number four, the rest of it would have been all

stuff] created in my imagination because, again, it
was the sale of something that didn't exist. This was
not settling. There was no real settlement money.

There were no real settlement documents. ] even
manufactured, | think, the actual plaintiff, because ]
don't recall even knowing the plaintiff's real name or
if 1 did it was of no significance to me.

Q. How would you have manufactured a
plaintiff's name, would you have created additional
documents to further your Ponzi scheme using
Mr. Epstein as the defendant?

A. No.

Q. How would you --

A. The name just would have appeared on the
Page 60

confidential settlement agreement.

Q. Would they have already seen the documents
ai that point?

A. | can't tell you one way or the other what
they had seen, because | don't know what they actually
looked at.

Q. Forgive me, you've now confused me so I'm
Just going to ask you for some clarification.

You used a legitimate case and created fake
settlement documents, correct, in the simplest sense?
A. If this culminated in an actual sale of a
fake settlement, then the answer is yes.
Q. So it was a real case with a real plaintiff
and real defendant, just a fake settlement document?
A. No. Let me see if] can clarify this for

you. Over 90 percent of the settlements that | sold,
the fake settlements, were completely fictitious?

Q. Right.

A. A very small percentage of them were based,
at least in part, on some type of real Jitigation that
‘either had occurred or was currently occurring. |
utilized the Epstein case to bolster the visual for
the investors that a real case existed. Because as
these were being sold to more sophisticated investors,

the questions kept coming up, w re -- how do we
