2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *949

to give effect to these rights that does not unduly complicate or prolong the proceedings. *°7 Thus, in a situation where
numerous victims might overwhelm courtroom seating capacity, the court might craft a reasonable alternative procedure to
assure attendance rights. One such reasonable procedure would appear to be closed-circuit transmission of court proceedings to
a facility sufficiently large to accommodate all the victims. This was the procedure followed in the Oklahoma City bombing
case, 498

But tracking the CVRA is not enough. The language for my proposed rule comes from another statute, 42 U.S.C. ¢ 10608(a),
which authorizes closed-circuit transmissions notwithstanding any provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to the

contrary in cases in which a proceeding has been transferred more than 350 miles. 4°? The Advisory Committee repeatedly
proposed folding language from the CVRA straight into the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. But if the goal is to fold
statutes into the Rules, other relevant victims’ statutes should be folded in as well.

While folding in a provision on closed-circuit broadcasting, there appears to be no good reason to limit such transmissions to
such situations where venue has been transferred. The CVRA mandates that the courts must always craft reasonable
procedures to protect the rights of multiple victims. °° The proposed rule simply authorizes courts to allow such
transmissions in appropriate cases. Interestingly, the CVRA's drafters specifically endorsed the closed-circuit procedure. >!

[*950] For reasons that have yet to be articulated, the Advisory Committee has not only failed to act on my proposal but it has
left in place a conflict between a statute and Rule 53. As noted above, 42 U.S.C. § /0608(a) specifically trumps Rule 53 in
situations where cases have been transferred more than 350 miles. *°? The Rules should at least be amended to fix that conflict.

503 While fixing that problem, the Advisory Committee should also adopt my change, which faithfully implements the CVRA's
commands.

(New) Rule 60(a)(1) - Notice of Proceedings for Victims The Proposals:
I proposed requiring federal prosecutors to give notice to crime victims of their rights and the court process as follows:
Rule 10.1 Notice to Victims.

(a) Identification of Victim. During the prosecution of a case, the attorney for the government shall, at the earliest reasonable
opportunity, identify the victims of the crime.

(b) Notice of Case Events. During the prosecution of a crime, the attorney for the government shall make reasonable efforts to
provide victims the earliest possible notice of:

City bombing case, closed-circuit broadcasting used; this is merely one example of how a court could fashion an appropriate procedure to
accommodate multiple victims).

502 42 US.C. § 10608(a).

*03 Perhaps it could be argued that Rule 53 itself accommodates any conflict because its prohibition of broadcasting applies except as
otherwise provided by a statute or these rules. Fed. R. Crim. P. 53. But reliance on that language is a bit odd because it should go without
saying that nothing in the Rules can trump a substantive statute passed by Congress. See 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b). Moreover, as a simple matter
of drafting clarity, it is desirable to have the Rules themselves avoid conflicts with statutes. Otherwise, courts may inadvertently follow the

Rules in violation of the statutory command. See, e.g., Cassell, Barbarians at the Gates, supra note 6, at 516 (recounting how this happened in
the Oklahoma City bombing case).
