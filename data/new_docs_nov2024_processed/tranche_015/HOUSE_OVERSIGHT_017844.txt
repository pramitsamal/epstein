Opinion and Order
CASEY, District Judge.

hijacked four United States passenger air-
planes and flew them into the twin towers
of the World Trade Center in New York
City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia,
and—due to passengers’ efforts to foil the
hijackers—an open field in Shanksville,
Pennsylvania. Thousands of people on the
planes, in the buildings, and on the ground
were killed in those attacks, countless oth-
ers were injured, and billions of dollars of
property was destroyed.

Panel centralized six then-pending Sep-

proceedings.” Additional actions, that are
not the subject of this opinion, have since
been filed. Plaintiffs in these consolidated
actions are more than three thousand sur-

and funded al Qaeda. The complaints al-
