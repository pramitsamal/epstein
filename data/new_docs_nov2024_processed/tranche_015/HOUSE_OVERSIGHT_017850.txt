plaint 9269-272; Burnett Complaint
19 354, 359; Federal Complaint 1480. Ac-
cording to Plaintiffs, with respect to his
alleged donations, “[alt best, Prince Sultan
was erossly negligent in the oversight and
administration of charitable funds, know-
ing they would be used to sponsor interna-
tional terrorism, but turning a blind eye.
At worse, Prince Sultan directly aided and
abetted and materially sponsored al Qaeda
and international terrorism.” Burnett
Complaint 1363; Federal Complaint
11 429-31 (alleging Prince Sultan knew
and intended that the contributions he
made to various charities would be used to
fund al Qaeda and international terror-
ism).?¢

2. Prince Turki

Prince Turki is currently the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the Unit-
ed Kingdom. Ashton Complaint { 263.
From 1977 until August 2001, he was the
Director of Saudi Arabia’s Department of
General Intelligence (‘DGI,” also known
by its Arabic name, Istakhbarat). Ashton
Complaint 1255; Burnett Complaint 1 343;
Federal Complaint 1445. As such, Plain-
tiffs allege he was or should have been
aware of the terrorist threat posed by
Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and the Tali-

Laden and al Qaeda. See, e.g., Burnett Com-
plaint 11160, 205, 229, 362; Exec. Order
13224.

20. Prince Sultan denies making any grants to
Al Haramain and MWL and argues that con-
tributions made to IIRO and WAMY were
made strictly in his official capacity on behalf
of the Saudi government. Further, he claims
the four charities searched their records and
confirmed that Prince Sultan did not make
any personal contributions. These transmittal
letters and government checks were included
in Prince Sultan’s motion to dismiss the D.C.
Burnett action. Judge Robertson found these
documents had “limited probative value, [as
they] lack[ed] proper foundations to establish
that the affiants could have known the actual
source of the moneys they received.” Burnett

ban. Ashton Complaint 1256; Burnett
Complaint 1348. Prince Turki allegedly
met with Osama bin Laden five times in
the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Ashton
Complaint 1257; Burnett Complaint { 344.
At one of those meetings, which Prince
Sultan also attended, bin Laden allegedly
offered the Saudis the use of his family’s
engineering equipment and suggested bol-
stering Saudi military forces with mili-
tants. Ashton Complaint 1253. Prince
Turki is alleged to have close ties with an
al Qaeda financier, Mr. Zouaydi, and is
allegedly implicated in Mr. Zouaydi’s fi-
nancial support of al Qaeda. Ashton Com-
plaint 1241; Burnett Complaint 1345.
Further, Plaintiffs claim Prince Turki met
with members of the Taliban and, in 1995,
gave the Taliban financial and material
support. Ashton Complaint 1257; Feder-
al Complaint 1144748 (alleging that, at
the time Prince Turki provided support,
the Taliban maintained a symbiotic rela-
tionship with al Qaeda and thus Prince
Turki knew al Qaeda would benefit from
the Kingdom’s support). In July 1998,
Prince Turki is alleged to have met with
members of the Taliban and representa-
tives of bin Laden and agreed to not extra-
dite bin Laden or close terrorist camps in
exchange for bin Laden’s protection of the

II, 292 F.Supp.2d at 16. This Court has re-
viewed these affidavits and agrees with Judge
Robertson’s assessment. For example, one
declarant who provided information regard-
ing alleged contributions relied on his person-
al knowledge of a charity’s records, yet he
had only been in his position for two months.
See Decl. of Saleh Abdullah Al Saykhan {i 2, at
Decl. of Sara E. Kropf in Support of Prince
Sultan’s Motion to Dismiss the D.C. Burnett
action. As Judge Robertson pointed out, “‘the
value of plaintiffs’ showing that Prince Sultan
did give money to these organizations in his
personal capacity, however, is no greater.”
Burnett I, 292 F.Supp.2d at 16 (referring to
Saudi press reports of Prince Sultan’s contri-
butions).
