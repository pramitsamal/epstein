Plaintiffs have failed to state a RICO claim
against the moving Defendants. See id.;
Redtail Leasing, Inc. v. Bellezza, 95 Civ.
5191JFK), 1997 WL 603496, at *5
(S.D.N.Y.1997) (“A defendant does not ‘di-
rect? an  enterprise’s affairs under
§ 1962(c) merely by engaging in wrongful
conduct that assists the enterprise.”);
Dep’t of Econ. Dev. v. Arthur Andersen &
Co., 924 F.Supp. 449, 466-67 (S.D.N.Y.
1996) (providing services to racketeering
enterprise is not directing the enterprise);
LaSalle Natl Bank v. Duff & Phelps Cred-
it Rating Co, 951 F.Supp. 1071, 1090
(S.D.N.Y.1996) (same). Plaintiffs’ RICO
claim under § 1962(d) fails for the same
reason. Plaintiffs have not alleged that
the moving Defendants were central fig-
ures in the underlying schemes or for con-
spiracy liability under § 1962(d). The
RICO claims against the moving Defen-
dants are dismissed.

3. TVPA

[77,78] “The TVPA establishes a cause
of action in federal court against an indi-
vidual who, under actual or apparent au-
thority, or color of law, of any foreign
nation subjects an individual to torture or
extrajudicial killing.” Arndt v. UBS AG,
342 F.Supp.2d 182, 141 (E.D.N.Y.2004)
(citing Flores, 343 F.3d at 153); 28 U.S.C.
§ 13850 note. Only individuals maybe sued
under the TVPA. Arndt, 342 F.Supp.2d at
141 (citing Friedman v. Bayer Corp., No.
99 Civ. 3675, 1999 WL 33457825, at *2

39. The ATA defines international terrorism as:
activities that—(A) involve violent acts or
acts dangerous to human life that are a
violation of the criminal laws of the United
States or of any State, or that would be a
criminal violation if committed within the
jurisdiction of the United States or of any
State; (B) appear to be intended—to intimi-
date or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to
influence the policy of a government by
intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect
the conduct of a government by assassina-

349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES

(E.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 1999)). Accordingly, to
the extent Plaintiffs have not already with-
drawn these claims, the TVPA claims are
dismissed against Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi
American Bank, Arab Bank, Al Baraka
Investment & Development Corp., NCB,
Saudi Binladin Group, and the SAAR Net-
work. Similarly, there have been no alle-
gations that Saleh Abdullah Kamel or Adel
Batterjee acted under color of law and,
therefore, the TVPA claims against these
individuals are dismissed as well.

4. ATA

[79,80] The ATA provides a civil rem-
edy for “[a]lny national of the United
States injured in his or her person, proper-
ty, or business by reason of an act of
international terrorism, or his or her es-
tate, survivors, or heirs.” 18 U.S.C.
§ 2338(a).° To adequately plead the pro-
vision of material support under this sec-
tion, a plaintiff would have to allege that
the defendant knew about the terrorists’
illegal activities, the defendant desired to
help those activities succeed, and the de-
fendant engaged in some act of helping
those activities. Boim I, 291 F.3d at
1023; see also Boim v. Quranic Literacy
Inst., 340 F.Supp.2d 885, 906-913 (N.D.III.
2004) (“Boum IIT”) (granting summary
judgment against two entity defendants
where record evidence demonstrated the
charities’ concession that Hamas used ter-
rorism in pursuit of its goals, the organiza-
tions’ repeated desire to help Hamas by

tion or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily
outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
United States, or transcend national bound-
aries in terms of the means by which they
are accomplished, the persons they appear
intended to intimidate or coerce, or the
locale in which their perpetrators operate
or seek asylum.

18 U.S.C. § 2331(1). For now, the Court

assumes the attacks of September 11 were an

act of international terrorism.
