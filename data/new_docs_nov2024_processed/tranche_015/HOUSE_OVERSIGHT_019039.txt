On May 22, 2006, I received several phone calls throughout the day
from Mr. who stated he had been followed aggressively by a private
investigator. Mr.[_|stated that as he drove to and from work and
running errands throughout the county, the same vehicle was behind him
running other vehicles off the road in an attempt not to lose sight of
Mr. vehicle.

I explained to him as Mr. Epstein had retained new legal council it

was possible it would be new private investigators following him to
observe his daily activities. I also explained to him that there was
a meeting scheduled with ASA Lana Belohlavek and Attorney Jack
Goldberger at Mr. Krischer's office scheduled on June 1, 2006 at 9:00
am. I attempted to call ASA Lana Belohlavek to inform her of the
private investigators following Mr.[_ Jhowever; she was on her vacation
during the week of May 22 through May 30 2006.

On May 23, 2006, I received other phone calls from Mr. and Mrs .[|who
advised they were able to acquire the private investigators license
plate information. The subj following them was again driving very
aggressively and caused Mrs. to run off the road. Mrs .[ | stated
the vehicle is a green Chevy Monte Carlo bearing Florida tag I35-XGA.
The vehicle is registered to Zachary Bechard of Jupiter Florida.
