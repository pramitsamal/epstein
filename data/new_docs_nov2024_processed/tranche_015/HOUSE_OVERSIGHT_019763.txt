CHAPTER 27
Snowden’s Choices

It is the choices we make that show who we truly are.

—J. K. ROWLING, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

USSIAN AUTHORITIES had the opportunity to thoroughly

debrief Snowden as to his motive for stealing state secrets,
whereas U.S. authorities did not. It cannot be assumed that he had
a single consistent motive in 2013. Snowden has shown, if nothing
else, that he was adaptable to changing circumstances. He might have
begun taking documents for one reason and found other reasons as
he proceeded in his quest. Many of the reported circumstances of his
activities, including his probes, contacts, theft, and escape, are dis-
puted by his supporters. Many of his other activities are shrouded
by the secrecy of the NSA. We do know, though, that Snowden made
four extraordinary choices during the nine-month period in 2013. If,
as is said, actions speak louder than words, Snowden’s four choices
illuminate the underlying concerns guiding his acts. In the case of a
classified intelligence breach, as in the post-action analysis of a mas-
terful chess game, the sequence of moves a player makes provides an
important clue to his strategy. Let us review what we have already
learned about these decisions.
