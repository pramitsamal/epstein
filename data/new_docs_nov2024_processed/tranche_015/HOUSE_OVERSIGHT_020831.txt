There are two caveats. First, we do not make policy recommendations. We try to help clarify
some of the issues in a straightforward, analytical way. We aim to present data, trends, and facts
about USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers to provide context for how its financials have
reached their present state. Our observations come from publicly available information, and we
use the tools of basic financial analysis to interpret it. Forecasts generally come from 3rd-party
agencies like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan federal agency charged
with reviewing the financial impact of legislation. Second, the ‘devil is in the details.’ For US
policy makers, the timing of material changes will be especially difficult, given the current
economic environment.

By the standards of any public corporation, USA Inc.’s financials are discouraging.

True, USA Inc. has many fundamental strengths. On an operating basis (excluding Medicare
and Medicaid spending and one-time charges), the federal government’s profit & loss statement
is solid, with a 4% median net margin over the last 15 years. But cash flow is deep in the red (by
almost $1.3 trillion last year, or -$11,000 per household), and USA Inc.’s net worth is negative
and deteriorating. That net worth figure includes the present value of unfunded entitlement
liabilities but not hard-to-value assets such as natural resources, the power to tax or mint
currency, or what Treasury calls “heritage” or “stewardship assets” like national parks.
Nevertheless, the trends are clear, and critical warning signs are evident in nearly every data
point we examine.

Note: USA federal fiscal year ends in September; Cash flow = total revenue — total spending on a cash basis; net worth includes unfunded future liabilities from

Social Security and Medicare on an accrual basis over the next 75 years. *One-time expenses in F2008 include $14B payments to Freddie Mac; F2009

includes $2798 net TARP payouts, $97B payment to Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac and $40B stimulus spending on discretionary items; F2010E includes $26B

net TARP income, $1378 stimulus spending and $41B payment to Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac. F2010 net worth improved dramatically owing to revised

actuarial estimates for Medicare program resulted from the Healthcare reform legisiation. For mare definitions, see next slide. Source: cash flow per White
