Revenue Drivers as Percent of Revenue:

Observations from Previous Slide

Social Insurance taxes (for entitlement programs) have risen materially
to 37% of revenue (vs. 33% 40-year average), and have risen
aggressively from 19% in 1965, owing to introduction of Medicare in
1965 and the 1983 reform of social security taxes.

Questions:

1) What level of social insurance / entitlement ‘tax’ can USA Inc. support on
an on-going basis? Rising from 19% of revenue in 1965 to 33% of revenue
in 2005 — of which 75% was spent on healthcare — takes its toll on other
areas of spending / growth. There are serious tradeoffs - every dollar that
goes to entitlement programs is not spent on education, infrastructure, and
defense.

2) Why have corporate income taxes fallen to 13% of revenue in 2009 from
22% in 1965 aside from recession? How crucial has this been to maintain
global competitive advantage and stimulating American job and GDP
growth?
