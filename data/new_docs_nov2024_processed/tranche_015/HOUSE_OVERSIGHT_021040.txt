Note: *The tax math presented here are pure mathematical illustrations — it is simply calculated to measure how much tax rates need to
increase (for the top two income brackets) to achieve a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3% by 2019E assuming a baseline budget path and relying on
personal income tax rate hikes alone. These calculations are merely mechanical illustrations and are not meant to portray realistic solutions.

Pros + Cons of Tax Rate Hikes

e Amore progressive income tax system could lower tax burden from
potential subsidy cuts and carbon taxes on the low-income population.

e Addressing income inequality may enhance perceived fairness — and
political chances — of comprehensive deficit measures.

Across-the-board tax rate increases would hurt nearly everyone, but
especially lower-income taxpayers.

Rate increases on upper brackets usually spur tax avoidance, and
revenues often fall short of targets.

Rate increases, which discourage savings, amplify distortions in the
economy from tax subsidies, exclusions and tax expenditures, all of
which encourage consumption.
