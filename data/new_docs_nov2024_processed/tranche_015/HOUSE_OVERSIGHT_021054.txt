Post Recession, There Are Many Long-Term Negative Consequences

Crowding Out Investment =» Lower Output & Income

~ A growing portion of people’s savings would be diverted to purchase
government debt rather than toward investment in productive capital goods.

— Government may be forced to raise marginal tax rates and / or reduce
spending on other programs to meet interest payments.
e Reduced Ability to Borrow > Less Policy Flexibility
— In case of economic downturns or international crises, government may not be
able to raise substantially more debt.
e Increased Chance of Sudden Fiscal Crisis Social / Economic Disruption

— Investors may lose confidence in government’s ability to repay debt & interest

without causing inflation.
