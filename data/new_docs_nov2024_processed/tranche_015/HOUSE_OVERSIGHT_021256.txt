that one need not agree with a
position to perform a deep and
thorough analysis of the
arguments for and against the
position. Objectivity in thought
and analysis are keys to reaching
a deep understanding of a topic.
By taking a position, developing
arguments for and against the
position, then taking the opposite
position and doing likewise, we
develop the capacity to be more
dispassionate and powerful
thinkers — and gain deeper
insight into a topic.

that one need not reach
agreement with someone to learn
a great deal from discussions
with them or to make significant
advances in addressing a
complex question. The salve of
affirmation can lead us to seek
like-minded others and to
denigrate and avoid those who
disagree with us. Although this
may provide temporary comfort,
it does little to help address deep
divisions or solve problems with
which we must deal in an
increasingly complex and diverse
world. There are inherent
tensions between the sciences
and the humanities, and these
tensions have led to a
polarization of views, an “it’s my
way or the highway” approach
toward those holding divergent
points of view. The contents of
this book illustrate an alternative
possibility. The Network is a
very interdisciplinary group, and
the perspectives captured in the
subsequent chapters reflect some
of the same tensions with which
other books dealing with science
and religion have dealt — and

from which they have not
benefitted. The tensions reflect
deep and enduring differences in
the way in which scholars in the
humanities, the social sciences,
and the sciences think about
theory, methods, and evidence.
These differences can test one’s
mettle but if acknowledged,
respected, embraced, and
pursued, they result in a richer,
more innovative and synergistic
collaborative effort. In the case
of our Network, this was neither
easy nor quick, but it was
achieved through a mutual
respect and exchange of ideas
and a shared conviction
regarding the importance of the
Network’s combination of
approaches from the humanities
and the sciences. In a sense, our
Network is a microcosm of the
structure that exists in our
society. If these tensions are
embraced and used to their full
catapultic effect, one can make
progress on serious problems,
transforming not only how we
think about the problem, but also
how we think about those who
hold different or opposing views.
that the insights or advances we
can achieve need not be our or
our opponent’s position, or a
less-than optimal compromise
between the two, but rather they
can be truly innovative, building
on and transcending both initial
positions. The specific forms of
such creative and transcendent
solutions are difficult to
articulate in advance but there is
a thought process — characterized
by clarity, openness, constructive
criticism, and synthesis — that
