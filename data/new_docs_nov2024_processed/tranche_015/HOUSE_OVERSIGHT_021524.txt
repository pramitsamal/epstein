D> EPSTEIN fom 1B

$100, according to the lawsuit.
The two attended the same
Palm Beach County high

school. Jane Doe No. 2 is now -

19.and living in Virginia, Her
man said,

Both lawsuits contend
that Epstein, 55, targeted
“economically disadvantaged
girls from western Palm
Beach County” who were
perceived as less likely to
complain to authorities, or
whose credibility would be
quest:oned if they did.

“Both complaints are full of
lies,” said Guy Lewis, former
US. attorney in Miami and
‘one of Epstein’s many attor-
neys. Jane Doe No. 2's lawsuit
“is an outrageous, defamatory
copycat of the first.”

There has been a twist in
the first Jane Doe lawsuit. Her
mother in Georgia contends
that her former husband
— Jane. Doe's father — con-
sulted with neither of them
before filing the lawsuit. She

. is asking a judge to. halt the

litigation until her daughter
turns 18 in May and can make
her own decisions.

The mother asked in court
filings to be added to the law-
suit, saying she “has suffered
and will continue to suffer
severe mental anguish and
pain’ as a result of Epstein’s
“reckless conduct.”

Jane Doe “just didn’t want
the lawsuit ‘going forward
with the fathers involve-
ment,” said Ted Leopold,
the mother’s attorney. “She
wanted to pursue it on her
own. The father essentially
did this on his own.”

Jane Doe has’ béen es-

tranged from her father since

Thanksgiving, Leopold said.
“That's why it's even stranger
what he did,” he said.

. The girls mother is asking
a judge in their divorce case
to find the father in contempt
of court for violating their
divorce decree by not con-
ferring with her on a matter

involving their daughter.
“The father has sole custo-
dy and has the right to make
decisions on his daughter's
rights,” Herman said.
Epstein is a wealthy New
York money manager who
has counted Bill Clinton,
Donald Trump and Britain's
Prince Andrew among his
friends.. He was the target of
a lengthy investigation into
his activities with girls by the
Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment that resulted in his in-
dictment in July 2006 on one
count of felony solicitation
of prostitution. That case is
pending. ; ’
Epstein has been sued in
New York by a woman who
says he had sex with her

when she was 16. Herman :

said he has received calls

from others making the same |

assertions in that state.

Hetman convened a news
conference Wednesday on
the middle bridge connecting
West Palm Beach and Palm
Beach.

“This is the bridge... these |}

girls were recruited to come
over and give a massage,” he
said. “When they crossed this
bridge, they had no idea what

was in store for them, This is_

a bridge of tears.”

Herman has described
both Jane Does as typical
teenage girls Epstein robbed
of their innocence.

But Harvard University law
Professor Alan Dershowitz,
another Epstein attorney, pro-
vided the state attorney's of-
fice with information gleaned
from the myspace.com Web
site two years ago showing
that some of Epstein’s alleged
victims boasted of their alco-
hol and marijuana use.

Herman said the girly

backgrounds aren’t relevant {|

to Epstein’s purported. be-
havior. “They don’t have the
mental capacity to consent
to something like this with a
grown man,” he said.
