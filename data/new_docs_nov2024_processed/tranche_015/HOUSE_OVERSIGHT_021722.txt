the V.I. Econom Development
Authority.

Bureau of Motor Vehicles

Bureau of Motor Vehicles Director
Jerris Browne defended a General
Fund appropriation of $1,642,010 as
sufficient to meet the bureau’s
needs. The request is a 5 percent
decrease, or $86,422, less than the
2013 appropriation.

Eighty-eight percent will go
toward personnel services and fringe
benefits, and the budget will be sup-
plemented by a projected income of
$1 million from the bureau’s revolv-

cal 2013 budget, the bureau elimi- .

nated two General Fund positions:
an executive assistant and motor
vehicle inspector, according to
Browpe’s testimony.

The fiscal 2014 operating budget
contains money for 52 positions,
and to further meet fiscal obliga-
tions, the bureau intends to leave
unfilled two more General Fund
positions, according to Browne’s
testimony.

A critical hiring plan leaves room
for five vacant positions to be filled,
however, Browne testified.

The bureau’s accomplishments
for fiscal 2013 include: completing
a REAL ID card toncept design
which allow for forensic analysis
and provides specializéd identi fica-
tions to government employees;
integratting facial recognition soft-
ware, providing 24 hour access to
the BMV database for law enforce-

‘ ment, installing additional security

cameras and completing two grant
packages for Division of Higheay
Safety awards totalling $730,000 to
be used to fund the motorcycle safe-
ty education program and to accom-
modate online vehicle registration.

Public Services Commission

Public Services Commission
Executive Director Keithley Joseph
testified that it is the commission’s
mission’s goal to move from being a
“government organization that is reac-
tive to a proactive public policy mak-
ing agency with results-based
management.”

The Public Services Commission is
pmmarily funded through assessments
levied on the utilities it regulates.

Joseph testified that the fiscal 2014
budget request from the V.I. govern-
ment for the commission would be
$1,620,740. This represents an
increase of $57,373, or 3.54 percent,
from its fiscal 2013 revenueassess-
ment of $1,563,367. Pursuant to
Virgin Islands Code establishing the
commission and stipulating that it be
100 percent funded by fees levied to
the utilities it regulates, the commis-
sion’s budget request reflects what it
needs to maintain operations while it
collects outstanding assessment from
communications, water and electric,
and public transportation companies,
Joseph said.

The commission’s uncollected rev-

enues from fiscal 2013 are $384,630,
according to Joseph’s testimony.

It is anticipated that in fiscal 2014,
the commission will collect a total of
$1,620,739 from the V.1. Water and
Power Authority; VITELCO,
Innovative Cable, Varlack Ventures,
Transportation Services and the V.1.
Waste Management Authonity, accord-
ing to testimony.

A total of $1,081,113 will go toward
“personal services and fringes,”
according to testimony.

V.I. Economic
Development Authority

V.I. Economic Development
Authority Chief Executive Officer
Percival Clouden requested a General
Fund appropriation of $5,043,274.
This amount represents an increase
of $325,574, or 6.9 percent over the
fiscal 2013 appropriation.

According to Clouden, the addi-
tional. money is needed to match fed-
eral funds for a small business incu-
bator program, to institute a more
aggressive marketing strategy for the
Economic “Development
Commission’s tax incentive program

and to enhance computer data analy-
sis programs for the Economic
Development Commission and the
lending divisions, according to
Clouden’s testimony.

During fiscal 2013, the authority
received $2 million in grants from
the United States Department of
Commerce Economic Development
Administration to assist small and
mid-size businesses in the territory.
The authority also relocated its offic-
es on St. Thomas, realizing a 20 per-
cent savings rental costs, 48 percent
in utilities and 15 percent in other
related expenses, Clouden said.

Also during fiscal 2013, the
authority realized a 4 percent increase
in collections and saw a 37 percent
decrease in the number of delinquent
borrowers due to enhanced litigation
efforts, Clouden said.

To date, the authority has approved
$692,606 in new 2013 loans and col-
lected $842,224 in outstanding
accounts. The number of delinquent
borrowers stands at 242, for a total of
$7,470,534, according to Clouden’s
testimony.
