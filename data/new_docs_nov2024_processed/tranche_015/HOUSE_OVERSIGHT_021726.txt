What a city owes its residents

Though it is the biggest city in -

U.S. history to file for bankruptcy,
Detroit is only one of 26 urban
municipalities that have gone into
bankruptcy or state receivership for
fiscal insolvency since 2008. Detroit
should draw attention and debate to
a challenging issue underlying all
these public insolvencies: What
level of public services will we pro-
tect and guarantee for U.S. cities?
The Bankruptcy Court will have
to face that question. It will have to

determine whether Detroit can cut

into current services any more than
it already has. Unless the state or
federal government steps in with
funds for operating costs, the bank-
ruptcy will function as a zero-sum
game, with residents fighting credi-
tors for a share of city revenue.
Creditors have contracts to monetize
what they are seeking, but how
should the court determine the pub-
lic spending that residents need
today ‘and tomorrow?

Politicians and judges who man-
age local fiscal crises speak of
maintaining basic services and
ensuring residents’ minimal health
and safety, but these concepts are
short on specifics. While our laws
provide an entitlement to a public
education, and we have long strug-
gled to interpret what constitutes a
legally adequate education, there is
little to nothing that would tell us
what other services the local public
sector must provide.

’ As a matter of law, there is no
such thing as a crime rate that is too
high or an ambulance response time
that is too long. Should there be?

For nov, it is left to politics and
moral judgment to determine wheth-
er it is acceptable that less than one
in three streetlights are operational
in Detroit or that the city has 80,000
abandoned and blighted structures
that it cannot afford to demolish. In
Detroit, as in many other struggling
cities, dramatic police layoffs mean
that the average wait time after a
911 call for a police officer is 58
minutes, and a resident can rarely
summon an officer at all if the

. reported crime is not in progress and
violent.

As for other public functions that
a high-poverty city (especially one
with severe winters) might hope to
have — such as reliable bus ser-
vice, playground equipment, indoor
basketball courts, after-school pro-
grams, active libraries and commu-
nity centers for the elderly — these

services are decades into deep cuts «
and widespread closures. Indeed,
having curtailed everything beyond
emergency services, it would be
tempting to refer to a government
like Detroit’s as a night-watchman
state — the libertarian ideal of a
government focused only on public
safety.

That is, we’d be tempted ‘to use
such a term for Detroit, and cities
like it, were it notsuch a cruel irony:
Detroit had more than 15,200 vio-
lent crimes and. 500 acts of arson in
2012. The night watchmen are
understaffed and underpaid.
According to a 2012 study by econ-
omists Aaron Chalfin and Justin
McCrary, public spending in Detroit
on each police officer (including all
wages, benefits and retirement costs)
is less than two-thirds what it is just
45 miles away in the prosperous
university town of Ann Arbor.

As a political and moral matter, as
much as a legal one, Detroit repre-
sents an opportunity to take a stand.
for urban habitability. What belongs
on our list of minimum standards for
a city? Detroit invites us to have a
public conversation about what ser-
vices and public spaces we expect
from city governments for human
dignity and for humans to flourish.
We have a chance to say that no one
should have to wait hopelessly for
an ambulance, that a violent crime
in a neighbothood every few hours
is intolerable. ;

Paying for such commitments
should not just be the burden of
creditors. Many of the city’s credi-
tors are rank-and-file public employ-
ees and retirees who have counted
on a public pension and are not eli-
gible for Social Security. Detroit’s
bankruptcy plan could send them
into poverty in their old age.

Basic services and safety in our
cities are the responsibility of
states, the federal government, the
private sector and voters. It is all of
them — all of us — who have a
role to play in the stabilization that
Detroit:is seeking through bank-
ruptcy. All of us have a responsibil-
ity to help them give basic health
and safety real meaning, and to
make this bankruptcy a safety net,
not a punishment.

Mrs. Anthony Weiner is Hillary 2.1

I sat there watching the television
screen as Anthony Weiner squirmed
before the microphones for the second
time in two years, and realized that
this was a deja vu moment.

At first I thought it was because the
former congressman and aspiring
mayoral candidate was, once again,
apologizing for tweeting and cheating
without really meeting. And then I
took one look at Weiner’s wife and
realized that this had absolutely noth-
ing to do with the fellow.

Huma Abedin might have creamy
olive skin, beautiful brown eyes and
long dark hair, but you don’t need to
put her in a pantsuit and slap a head-
band on her tresses to realize that we
ate now in the presence of Hillary
Clinton, version 2.1.

We all remembet the pre-Senate,
pre-State Department Hillary who
inspired both awe and revulsion for
her assault on the East Wing. Never
before had we been treated to a first
lady who so. blatantly and brazenly
sought equal status with the guy we’d
actually elected.

Eleanor Roosevelt, her idol, had
exercised a considerable amount of
weight behind the scenes. But it
wasn’t until Franklin died that she
really came into her own. Not so Mrs.
Clinton, or, rather, Mrs. Rodham
Clinton.

It was painfully obvious to anyone
paying attention that Bill’s wife was
hell bent on giving us that two-for-one
bargain that the couple had promised
during the campaign. Say what you
will about her, Hillary was a force to
be reckoned with. And praised. And
loathed. Even her most strident ene-
mies didn’t underestimate her survival
instincts.

Health care? (If at first you don’t

succeed ... .) Whitewater? (Did any-_

one say rafting?) Vince Foster?
(Personal tragedy, nothing more.) And
then came the stream of women:
Gennifer (no relation,) Paula (a genu-
ine victim) and, of course, “A little bit
of Monica.”

Anyone who thought that Hillary
was going to let the Bimbo Bombs
destroy her carefully constructed plans
clearly didn’t know just who they
were dealing with. Our first lady stood
by her philandering man and rode the
crest of a sympathetic wave into the
Senate. Mrs. Wynette Goes To
Washington, so to speak.

~ And who did she take with her on
that long and fruitful journey, ever
upward, ever more successfully? Why
none other than Mrs. Weiner, the love-
ly, inscrutable Huma.

Hillary once said that she had one
daughter, but that.ifshe had another it
would be her béloved personal
assistant.

HumaAbedin has been by her men-
tor’s side for almost two decades, and
it is yeasonable to think thatshe spent
a large part of that time taking notes
about how to thrive and survive in the
political jungle. Therefore, it is not
surprising that she (1) chose tomany
an animal indigenous to that environ-
ment i.e., a cheetah, and (2) figured
out how to make sure that she could
withstand whatever wounds he man-
aged to inflict on their shared
ambitions.

Anthony’s wife has taken a page
from her pseudo-mama’s dog-eared
book and has perfected the art of dam-
age control.

First, you assume a posture of dig-
nified disappointment, wherein your
whole body seems to just “‘sigh” under

the weight of the offensive conduct.
It’s a cross between an “I can’t believe
he did this to me” and a “boys will be
boys, God bless their randy little
hearts.” Then, you gaze sadly at the
perpetrator as he stares into the cam-
era and apologizes for the second,
third or 13th time for being a pervert
with his privates. Then, you allow him
to draw a line in the sand where he
says he might be sorry but he won’t
go gentleinto that good campaign and
is continuing to seek the mayoral
prize. :

And then you spring into action.
You straighten your shoulders, raise
youn pointed chin, allow a few wisps
of that luxuriant velvet hair to fall
across your delicately drawn cheek
and assume a stoic pose. You love-
him, you say. You believe in him, you
say. You forgive him, you say. You
idiot, we say.

But you do not hear us speaking,
because you do not care what the pea-
nut gallery thinks. This is not about
the crowds massed to watch this pub-
lic shaming. This is not even about
your husband who, truth be told, is
probably sleeping in the garage these
days, which is why he has both the
time and the inclination to tweet.

This is about something far more
important to you, perhaps almost as
important as the future of the child
you and the Tweeter have in common.
This is about your political survival.

Huma Abedin learned at the feet of
a master, someone who might very
well parlay her experience as scored
wife into an office in the West Wing.
Huma is a bit more modest, of course.
Seems she’d be content to redecorate
Gracie Mansion.
