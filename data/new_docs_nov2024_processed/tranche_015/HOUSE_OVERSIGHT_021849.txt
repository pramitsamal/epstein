Q. We will get there. But my -- I want to make
sure we are clear about this.

Am I correct that the report itself never
says, Alan Dershowitz abused anyone?

A. That is a correct statement, I believe.

Q. And we won't -- and the report does
reflect -- the conclusion of -- it reflects abuse of
minors by Jeffrey Epstein, correct?

A. Oh yes, oh yea. What it shows is forcible
rape of underage girls, and not a, shall we say, one off
situation, but on something that is happening over,
let's say, this is roughly a six-month period, 180
days -- I mean, I think you know, they document roughly
speaking at least 180 sexual encounters give or take,
and in fact, on some days, what they document in that
police report is abuse that is taking place not once,
not twice, but three times during the day in this
mansion.

And so I certainly agree with you, if it's
possible, maybe my math is off here, 200 percent, that
this report documents repeated sexual abuse including
forcible rape by one of the closest friends of
Mr. Dershowitz, Jeffrey Epstein.

Q. So it's your testimony that Mr. Epstein was

one of Professor Dershowitz's closest friends?
