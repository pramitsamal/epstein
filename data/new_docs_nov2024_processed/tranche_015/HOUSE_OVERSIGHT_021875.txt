But I very much recall that there were going

Roberts. And that was the basis on which I filed this
pleading, along with my colleague Mr. Edwards.

MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike nonresponsive

portion of the answer.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Let me ask you this: In your pleading, in
your motion to join, you allege that Professor
Dershowitz abused Virginia Roberts, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. How did adding and other minors enhance
your legal position in this case?

A. So that's -- let me just be clear before I
dive into that. It enhanced the legal position in
multiple ways, so I am going to end up giving a long
answer, I just want to tip you off, if that's what you
want, I would be happy to give the extended answer.

Q. I would like to know why you alleged and
other minors given what you have said about your
knowledge of the factual basis, so to speak, for that

allegation.
