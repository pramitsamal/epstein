if I could refer -- I need to refresh my recollection --
well, you may not want me to look at a document.

It was either Exhibit 1 or 2 this morning
during Dershowitz's deposition which was covering a time
period of January to, I believe, September 2005. These
were flight logs that were produced by Mr. Dershowitz to
the Palm Beach Police Department.

When you wonder why did they stop in
September, you Know, why stop in September 2005? What's
the significance of that? Well, later on, additional
flight logs were obtained, and sure enough, who shows up
on an October 2005 flight log with Jeffrey Epstein?

Mr. Dershowitz.

So that led to a suspicion that
Mr. Dershowitz had provided to the Palm Beach Police
Department flight logs that, the time period of which
for the production had been carefully crafted to keep
him out of it; in other words, to not produce the
October 2005 version.

The other thing I began to discover is, I
started going through some flight logs. Dave Rogers,
who is one of I think about three pilots that Epstein
regularly relied on to fly his -- he had very fancy --
to use the technical term -- jets. There were about

three pilots there.
