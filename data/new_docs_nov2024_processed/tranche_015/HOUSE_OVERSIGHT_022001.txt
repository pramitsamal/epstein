_ Vicky Ward: October 2002
4 pstein went out of his way to spin the Vanity Fair story to

his own ends, and soon after she got the assignment, Vicky
.dWard’s phone began to ring off the hook: calls from Ace
Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, the current head of Bear Stearns;
from Les Wexner; from academics, scientists, and movers and
shakers who counted Epstein among their friends.
Then there were the calls from Epstein himself. He wouldn't
' go on the record, but despite the rumors he'd spread behind
| Ward’s back, he was happy to talk informally, even give her a
_ tour of his Manhattan mansion and trot out stories that he had
' dined out on for years. By most accounts, Epstein could be
' &xtremely charming —even if it had taken Ghislaine to teach
him which forks to use when—and he did his best to charm
Vicky Ward. But she was not easily seduced, and she turned out
to have a keen eye for Epstein’s missteps.
