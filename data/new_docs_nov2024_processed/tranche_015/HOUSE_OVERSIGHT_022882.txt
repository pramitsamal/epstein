had different problems than the very wealthy. Dealing
with a billion dollars was different from dealing with
$100 million. “If you had a billion dollars I would think
the last thing you should be worried about was money,
in truth money was what you most worried about. How
to make more of it, how to give away more of it, how to
protect your children from it, how to hide it from your
wife or husband, how to minimize your taxes on it. The
traditional wealth service structure, an accountant, and
investment advisor, a personal lawyer, and an idiot
brother-in-law, became hopelessly outdated as amounts
exponentially increased.

“You can’t spend a billion dollars, you can just
reallocate it to a different investment class. And you
can’t give away a billion dollars without a vast staff, in
effect going into the business of giving away money, yet
another business you are likely to know little about.”

For a period, one part of his activities, he says, was
recovering monies for countries looted by exiled
dictators or military strongmen. Then, in his telling, he
was representing a series of vastly wealthy people and
families—not just doing their bidding or their investing,
but helping them to navigate the ambitions of their
wealth. If they had big dreams before, it’s nothing to
what they can have now.

If early in his career he might have seemed like a
sort of George Peppard (there’s a physical resemblance)
in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s
George Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.
