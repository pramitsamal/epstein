in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids, or, as
Vanity Fair would baldly dub it, the new establishment,
an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at
further and further remove from the ordinary one.
Epstein’s is just one version, albeit picaresque and
louche, of this shared story.

Epstein often tells, with some obvious marvel, his
middle class to riches tale: born in 1953 in Coney
Island, father worked for the city’s Parks Department,
mother a housewife.

The captain of the math team at Lafayette High
school in Bensonhurst, he went on to Cooper Union
where the tuition is free. He dropped out after two years
and began taking classes at the NYU’s Courant Institute
of Mathematics. Then, without a college degree, hence
by a slight of hand, he got a job teaching math and
physics at Dalton in 1974. (A few years ago, during a
chance encounter with a former Dalton math department
chairman, Margo Gumport, I asked her about Epstein.
She said he was the most brilliant math teacher at
Dalton in her 50-year career and that she had often
wondered what had become of him.)

Dalton was his first exposure to the wealthy. They
have, he concluded, just as many problems as the people
in Coney Island, but different ones, almost invariably
involving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a
science experiment,” he recalled recently as we chatted
about his life. “It did not really involve me. I could just
stand back and watch.”
