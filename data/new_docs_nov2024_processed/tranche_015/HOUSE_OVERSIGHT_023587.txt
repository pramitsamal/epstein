The current price of the V2X Aug/Sep/Oct fly would have
overestimated the value of a 1d/26d/46d fly (i.e., equivalent
tenor to the Aug/Sep/Oct fly 1d before the Aug expiry) 94% of
the time since Jun-09. This suggests it has ample room to trade
lower should political uncertainty abate by Aug. However, if
instead implied risk becomes more concentrated in the 20-Sep
to 20-Oct period ahead of the Aug expiry (due to, say, political
developments in Italy or Germany increasing risk perception),
the fly would stand to gain considerably.
