Notable trends and dislocations (Asia)

Asian equity markets saw modest gains last week, led by Japan’s NKY index, which
increased 2.5% week-over-week. In fact, the index breached the 20,000 mark last Friday
for the first time since December 2015. Gains were driven by foreign inflows from
investors attracted to very strong corporate profits. Additionally, economic data from
last week indicated that Japan’s unemployment rate held at a two-decade low, and
capital spending during Q1 beat analyst estimates. The biggest contributor to last
weeks’ return was Fast Retailing Co Ltd (9983 JT), which added 3.9% week-over-week.
The company reported that same-store-sales for its Uniqlo stores rose 2.4% year-over-
year in May due to successful strategies during the Golden Week and Mother’s Day
holidays. After the NKY, last week’s second biggest gainer was Hong Kong’s HSI, which
added 1.1%. The leading name in the index was Geely Automobile Holdings (175 Hk),
which jumped 19.8% week-over-week in response to optimism over its recent
acquisition of a 49.9% stake in Proton Holdings. Hong Kong’s HSCEI saw a similar return
as the index added 0.8% last week.

Next we turn to India, where the NIFTY gained 0.6% last week. The leading name in the
index was Aurobindo Pharma (ARBP |S), which increased 11.4% week-over-week in
response to an investor presentation which outlined the company’s plans to increase
collaboration across its global customer business. Elsewhere in Asia, Korea’s KOSPI
increased 0.3% week-over-week, Australia’s ASX added 0.6%, and Taiwan’s TWSE
gained 0.5%.

« Asian 3m ATM volatility increased on average 0.1 vol point to 12.6% last week,
while 10 day realized vol fell on average 0.8 vol points to 8.6%. Notably, NIFTY’s
implied vol increased 0.7 vol points, the biggest increase in the region. On the other
hand, the HSCEI’s 10d realized vol saw the largest drop in the region, falling 5.1 vol
points week-over-week to 9.2%.

¢ On average, term structures among Asian indices remained unchanged at 3.8% last
week. The KOSPI 12M-1M term structure steepened the most, increasing 0.7 vol
