Rationale

Investors should re-assess attractiveness of popular and (typically) technically motivated longer-
dated RV vol trades, given environment of structurally higher political & economic risks and
increasingly limited policy options

Cheap equity upside in a bond / equity melt-up

Risks of a hard Brexit rising and (weak) currency tailwind likely to prove short-lived; position
cheaply for FTSE 100 (UKX) underperformance

Using derivatives to capture Brazil (EWZ) upside potential following start of easing cycle
Remain long equities and cheapen hedges by conditioning on rates

China risk premium rising but A-shares vol still at all-time lows

Equity-FX correlation is not priced for a spillover of populism into the EU, which could cause EUR
(0 fall against an already weakened GBP as equities fall

UKX is heavily exposed to EU (50% revenues) and should underperform SPX if GBP tailwind
fades. Volatility & correlation suit well for outperformance

Cheapen long XLF upside to near 8y lows via selling upside on structurally challenged European
banks & relatively more bearish outlook for US rates vs EU

Still depressed equity-bond correlation (US 5Y bonds vs. SPX in the 37th%-ile since Jun-88)
cheapens the cost of SPX puts conditioned on higher rates

Participate in the continuation of the reflation trade. Cheapen Financials upside by selling rich
Utilities and Staples vol & expensive correl.

Higher US rates and stronger dollar are likely to hurt companies exposed to EM and help US DM.
Trade the outperformance in a risk-controlled way, avoiding

selling the record-low correlation

USDJPY and NKY the biggest beneficiaries of a Trump win

Banks and Insurances are the most leveraged sector

Banks and Insurances are the most leveraged sector

China risk premium rising but A-shares vol still at all-time lows

Own contrarian EM upside at low cost & limited risk

QE uncertainty and USDJPY vol support NKY vs SPX realized vol

What if QE hits its limit’? Long NKY vol outright which is cheap to carry

With fiscal stimulus and potential tax cuts, small caps revert to old normal generating higher vol
on upside and downside relative to large caps

Vol and price technicals are attractive. BofAML commodity strategists oil target is $70/bbl but this
is already priced in SXEP levels according to BofAML Oil & Gas equity analysts

Position for a near-term wobble followed by yet another equity melt up
Cheaply access positive carry QE failure hedge

Position for a pick-up in single stock realised vol on the 10 names (within FTSE’s top 30) where
post EU referendum realised vol was the highest relative to current 1y ATMf vol. The 10 names
are: Barclays, Aviva, Prudential, BT, Glencore, Tesco, CRH, BA, Standard Chartered & HSBC.

Hedge portfolios against a buy-the-dip failure should a faster rate cycle ultimately jeopardize it

Sell rich Financials vol to fund cheap Tech upside

Market may trade on the MSCI inclusion theme; Hedge with 2823 HK Jun17 95% put

Market may trade on the MSCI inclusion theme; Hedge with 2823 HK Jun17 95% put
Historically attractive to own TOPIX Top 10 corridor gamma weighted volatility dispersion
Hedge a rollover in China GDP and screen for cyclicals that could face pressure

Hedge a rollover in China GDP and screen for cyclicals that could face pressure

Benefit from low vol, flat correl, likely hawkish ECB & (FX un-hedged)} inflows into EU equities
Leverage cheap equity vs. FX vols to own cheap tail protection

Buy cheap EM equity puts on near-record performance gap to commodities

Monetise low vol & high implied correl to position for greater sector dispersion in EU: long basket
call, short worst-of call

Own cheap NKY hedges into FOMC; Term structure is too steep is under-pricing risks

Buy unloved and cheap biotech upside by levering depressed vol & skew
