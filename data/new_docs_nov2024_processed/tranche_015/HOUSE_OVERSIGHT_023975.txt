Reinvented from the former Hotel Hana Maui, the brand new Now Live

Travaasa Hana combines - in concept and name - travel and pravaasa

(‘memorable journey in Sanskrit). The mix of adventure, relaxation and

truly experiencing a destination are hallmarks of Travaasa. With the
beauty of Hana, Hawaii, all around, it's hard to imagine a better
marriage of purpose and place.
