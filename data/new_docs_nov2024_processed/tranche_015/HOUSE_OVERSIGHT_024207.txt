The sector has been not only a substantial long-only underweight, but also a wholesale short for
many macro/generalist hedge funds. However, it is very interesting to note that an inflection point
appears to have occurred in the middle of 2012, with hedge funds increasing their net exposure to
the global utility sector after a long period of reducing net. The long/short ratio of utility stocks held
by hedge funds fell from 3.0x in Jan 08 to about 1.7x in Jan 12 (4 years), but has since risen by 60% to
2.7x, which is more than twice the increase for hedge funds’ overall net exposure during the same
period (source: Goldman Sachs).

Based on discussions with the Street, it appears that this short exposure has been expressed via ETFs,
regional utility indices or large bellwether index utility proxies. Individual name crowdedness has
continued to remain at a low level (e.g., utilities rarely show up Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP list —
ticker GSTHHVIP). Today, utilities account for the lowest in gross assets held of the 10 global
sectors. (Source: Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund Trend Monitor analysis of 700 hedge funds with $1.3
trillion in gross assets.)

In addition, global QE programs have boosted demand for higher-beta stocks, which has contributed
to the recent relative underperformance of and lack of interest in utilities. However (see below), the
underperformance of US _ utilities has diminished with each successive QE round (QE1
