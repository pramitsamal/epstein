models/prospects. This can be triggered by improving sector fundamentals, better data points, or
conversely by events that instead lower investors’ perception of economic growth prospects (e.g., policy
errors, rising European sovereign yields, higher commodity prices, etc.).

As noted above (page 5), each time the sector’s underweighting reaches 1 standard deviation below the
mean, over the next 24 months global utilities rise by 38% on an absolute basis and outperform the global
broad market by 20%, on average (see graph below).

When these outperformance rallies occur, the potential massive alpha opportunity can be substantially

o  Post-Dotcom Rallies

The last time we saw underperformance anywhere close to today’s magnitude was during the 3-
year run-up to the dotcom bust (see graph below) as investors grabbed for growth in the “new
economy”. During the run-up (Jan 97-Jan 00), tech and telecom were the best-performing sectors,
+322% and +162%, respectively. The global utilities sector was the second-worst-performing global
sector, +12% and in line with the +9% worst-performing materials sector.
