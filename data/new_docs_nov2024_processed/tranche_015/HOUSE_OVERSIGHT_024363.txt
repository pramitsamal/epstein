registration of shares on Form S-3 in May and December 2018, and the issuance of our senior notes in September 2018.

(3) Includes $475,782 in fees related to our initial public offering in April 2017 that were reported in “All Other Fees” in our proxy statement prepared in
connection with our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.

In considering the nature of the services provided by the independent auditor, the Audit Committee determined that such services are
compatible with the provision of independent audit services. The Audit Committee discussed these services with the independent auditor and Carvana
management to determine that they are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the SEC to implement
the Sarbanes—Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

The Audit Committee has adopted a policy that requires advance approval of all audit services as well as non-audit services to the extent
required by the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes—Oxley Act of 2002. Unless the specific service has been previously pre-approved with respect to that year,
the Audit Committee must approve the permitted service before the independent auditor is engaged to perform it.

The Audit Committee approved all services provided by Grant Thornton LLP. Representatives of Grant Thornton LLP are expected to be
present at the annual meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and we expect that they will be available to
respond to questions.
