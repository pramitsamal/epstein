couldn't get work and his work was his life so he might as well
be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him,
well, now they could have a second chance because he was still
alive. The obituary evoked inquiries from newspapers, wire

services, foreign publications, radio and TV.

“What's the meaning of it?” one editor asked me.

“There's a lot of excitement at the city desk.”
“That /s the meaning of it.”

A few years later, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the
editor of a short-lived magazine, Cheetah, published a fake
obituary of me. | thought it was funny. An Associated Press

reporter called, and | explained that it was a hoax.
“Are you sure?” he asked.
“Of course. | would tell you if | was dead.”

Siegel started writing for Cava/ier. His first assignment was
a profile of Sterling Hayden, an actor best known in Dr
Stranglove or How | Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the
Bomb.
