7. DISTRIBUTION POLICY

We intend to retain any future earnings to fund working capital, debt service, acquisitions and growth and
do not expect to make distributions for the foreseeable future. Any determination to make distributions in
the future will be at the discretion of the General Partner and will depend upon our results of operations,
financial condition and other factors, as the General Partner, in its discretion, deems relevant. Limitations
in the credit facility and indenture of KLC restrict distributions by KLC that could, in turn, be made
available for future distributions by KUE to its partners.
