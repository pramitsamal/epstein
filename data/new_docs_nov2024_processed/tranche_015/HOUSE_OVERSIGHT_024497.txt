8.3.1. Early Childhood Education’s Role in the Economy

ECE enables people to pursue income-generating activities by allowing parents to participate in the
workforce and contribute to the economy. A recent study found that every dollar spent on the formal ECE
sector generates approximately 15 dollars worth of additional earnings by parents. Furthermore,
evidence suggests that regardless of family income, children who have participated in ECE programs do
better in school than their peers who did not. ECE also reduces social and economic costs by lowering
school dropout rates, and leads to decreased levels of criminal activity. These social and demographic
forces have established ECE as a fundamental component of today’s economic ‘infrastructure’ and a
source of economic growth.

Given these and other supporting facts, education is an industry that is of growing importance to the
economy. This growth is driven by the following factors:

™ Growing public_awareness of the importance of early childhood education. ECE has received
increased media and government attention as scientific research highlights the importance of
education during a child’s early developmental years. Children who attend high quality ECE centers
demonstrate greater mathematical ability, thinking and attention skills, and fewer behavioral problems
throughout their educational lives, when compared with children receiving no or lower quality care.
These differences hold true for children from a range of family backgrounds.”

™ Favorable demographic trends. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the annual
number of live births in the U.S. was approximately 4.1 million in 2003, compared to approximately 3.6
million in 1980, and the U.S. Census Bureau projects the annual number of live births to increase to
approximately 4.5 million in 2015.” The number of children aged five years or under grew from
approximately 22.5 million in 1990 to approximately 23.4 million in 2002, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau, and is projected to reach 26.8 million in 2015,”

B Changing workforce composition. A rising percentage of women participate in the workforce due to an
increasingly higher cost of living, a desire for financial independence and an elevated standard of
living preference, which necessitates two full-time wage earners for most families. Of the nearly 65
million jobs created nationally between 1964 and 1997, 40 million were occupied by women. Today,
more than 62% of mothers with children under the age of six work full-time compared to 19% in 1960.
