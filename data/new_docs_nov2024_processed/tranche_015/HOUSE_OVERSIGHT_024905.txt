head ona surface). The primary efficacy endpoint of the trials was a comparison
between Epidiolex and placebo in the percentage change in the monthly frequency of
drop seizures during the 14 week treatment period (including 2 weeks of dose
escalation) compared to the 4 week baseline period. Following the completion of the
blinded portion of the trial, all patients were eligible to receive Epidiolex in an open label
extension study.

The first Phase Ill trial, patients were on an average of three AEDs, and had previously
tried and failed an average of 6 other AEDs. Even on their baseline medications, the
patients were experiencing a median baseline drop seizure frequency of 74 per month.
The average age of patients in the trial was 15 years, although 34% were 18 years or
older. On the primary endpoint, Epidiolex produced a median reduction in monthly drop
seizures of 44% compared to a reduction of 22% in patients taking placebo (p=0.0135).
Epidiolex reduced all seizures by 41% vs. a 14% reduction for placebo (p=0.0005), while
the reduction in all seizures during the maintenance period was 45% for Epidiolex vs.
15% for placebo (p=0.0004). Similar to the Dravet trial, there was a clear separation
between Epidiolex and placebo on percent reduction in drop seizure frequency across all
magnitudes of reduction. In particular, 44% of Epidiolex patients had at least a 50%
reduction in drop seizures, compared to 24% of patients taking placebo (p=0.0043). 58%
of Epidiolex patients compared to 34% of placebo patients were rated as slightly
improved, “much improved or “very much improved on the Subject/Caregiver Global
Impression of Change.

Epidiolex appeared to be well tolerated in the trial. 86% of patients on Epdiolex had an
adverse event, compared to 69% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events
were diarrhea (19% of patients on Epidiolex vs. 8% of placebo patients), somnolence
(15% vs. 9%), pyrexia (13% vs. 8%), decreased appetite (13% vs. 2%) and vomiting (11%
vs. 17%). Again, there was no difference in the number of patients who experienced
status epilepticus between Epidiolex (n=1) and placebo (n=1). There was one death in
the Epidiolex group from acute respiratory distress syndrome, but it was not considered
treatment related. Increases in ALT or AST (>3xULN) occurred in 20 CBD and 1 placebo
patient, all of whom were on concomitant valproic acid. All elevations resolved.

In September 2016, GW announced that Epidiolex's second Phase III pivotal trial
(GWPCARE3) in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was also successful. On

average, patients were on 3 AEDs at baseline, having previously tried and failed a mean
of 7 other AEDs (median=10). The median baseline drop seizure frequency was 85 per
