After 20 years of failed peace talks, is it possible that the two
sides' positions on borders, refugees and other issues are just
unbridgeable and no amount of talks will make a difference?

Peace between conflicting parties is not about Saeb Erekat waking up
one morning and feeling his conscience aching for Israelis or Israelis
waking up and feeling their conscience aching for my suffering. It's
about the matrix of interests maturing. Once any conflicting party
believes that making peace is cheaper than continuing war, he'll do it.
Our matrix of interest has matured to deliver the requirement for
peace, but Israel hasn't opened the door. They think maintaining the
status quo is best for them. We are trying to show them that the status
quo is not sustainable.
