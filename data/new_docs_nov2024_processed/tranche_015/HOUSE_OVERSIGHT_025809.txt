Spare capacity (Iraq is trying to develop same); 4. Who has strategic influence over
ME oil will matter; 5. Oil and global GDP are connected. In some ways, our
energy policy may become more difficult. One big question is whether China will
continue their policy of non-intervention in internal affairs of other countries (e.g.
KSA goes Islamic). KSA’s response to Arab Spring was to double the pay of
everyone in the military.

Gfoeller. KSA social welfare was $20/bbl per year, now $85/bbl, projected at
$300/bbl in 2030. This means they will have to go to taxes and that will trigger
social reaction. Arabs have already translated “‘no taxation without representation”’.
Major political shifts are occurring and major financial stresses are predictable.
Free health care and education are untouchable. Arab Spring will come to KSA.
AQ was easy to fight because you could identify bad guys and kill them. Could
fight their ideology. Arab Spring has no leaders, no ideology. They want
everything: money, power and vote. When will KSA get nukes? Realignment of
national security team (Bander plus 2 other major changes suggest a major focus
and potential big deals in the offing. Is this about Iran or Russia and china or Arab
Spring or something else.

Mehgan: Power of being energy indep has consequences. Being a major consumer
has leverage. KSA taking oil off market will still be meaningful. Will China retain
its policy of non-interference in internal afairs when faced with Islamist take over of
KSA?

US Policy Going Forward
TJP Summary: see write up

Bob Blackwill:

Pivot to Asia does not relieve us of serious interests we have in ME. We announce
a pivot to Asia when:

Iran — moving to nukes

Egypt — Mubarak is in a cage and new govt could be seriously anti-US

Syria — disintegrating

Iraq — could fragment

KSA — ripe for revolution

ME peace process 1s dead

Israel — at more serious risk than in living memory
