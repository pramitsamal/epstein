BofAML GFSI™ X-Asset Risk Landscape

GFSI makes new YTD lows as BoE & NFP boost risk assets

The GFSI declined to a new YTD low of 0.18 as of 5-Aug, a level not seen since Nov-15.
With the BoE surprising to the upside in terms of cutting rates, re-starting QE and
guiding towards more accommodative policy down the line, as well as better than
expected US non-farm payrolls, risk assets globally got a boost.

« Credit experienced the biggest decline in stress across assets: Chart 3
shows that credit (followed by equities) experienced the biggest weekly stress
decline. Indeed, Chart 5 and Chart 6 show that sovereign risk as measured by IG
& sub-IG foreign sovereign bond spreads experienced the most significant
weekly declines in stress versus their history in the GFSI.

- Europe continues to be most stressed region: Chart 4 shows that Europe is
the most stressed region in the GFSI, despite the stress declines last week. US-
related stresses which were already relatively lower vs the other regions, were
more resilient. Indeed the only significant move higher in regional stress was in
USD Libor-OlS spreads (Chart 5), which our Rates strategists view as driven by

the anticipation of US money market mutual fund reform in October.
