It was fun and interesting.
| admire your friends determination.

Are you serious about working on this?

Has anyone done a full analysis of this and polarization.

Seems like on one hand it might encourage Ralph Nader cuz he d get more first round votes and not elect George

bush. This might be bad.

On other hand, gore would not have to move left to take Nader vote.

If | like centrism is it clear that this is better.

| get that it avoids arbitrary outcomes but assume that a tea party nut is as likely to elect a dem as a lefty is to elect et a

republican.
Anyway thanks for setting up.
Btw | gave them 10,000.
