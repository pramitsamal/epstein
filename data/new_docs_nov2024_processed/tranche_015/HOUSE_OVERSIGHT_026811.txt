Yemen in crisis: a new global choke-point?

-13 percent of world’s oil travels
through Gulf of Aden as it travels up
through Suez Canal — almost all of it
heading to Europe.

- Almost 8 percent of all world trade
via shipping goes through Suez
Canal.

- Iran is seen to be trying to build a
“Shia Crescent.”

- lran sees/fears being encircled by
“Sunni Crescent.”

- If Yemen falls completely to Houthi

tribal control — de facto, becoming an
lranian satellite — what threat does it

pose to Saudi Arabia?

- Question: will a nuclear deal with
lran empower them regionally? Or
will it further spur the Sunni nations to
increase their defense efforts?
