‘The Three Principal Players Have Different Perspectives” Division

National Security Advisor John Bolton

em

= “Bolton wants a crisis. He hopes to use the pressure as a maximum containment strategy to cripple the
Iranian economy, increasing domestic opposition to the government, and making regime change more
likely.

» ... ‘forcing’ the Americans to engage in military intervention for Bolton [is] a useful pretext to bombing
key nuclear facilities that would set the Iranian program back years or more.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

= “Pompeo wants the band back together. He doesn’t believe the United States can credibly induce the
Iranians towards a more constructive posture by themselves, and accordingly wants a tougher, common
front to force better terms from Iran from a position of strength.

= Pompeo hopes the Europeans and other allies will be more supportive of broader American pressure
against Iran, and a multilateral coalition can come back together.”

President Trump

= “President Trump wants a breakthrough on his terms. He wants to use American power to force the
Iranians into direct negotiations, and pull off a better agreement than Obama did.”
