forgiven its criminal, terrorist, or militant
pursuits simply because it also engages in
political or humanitarian ones. As the
Burgas bus bombing demonstrates, the
Party of God can and has mobilized
operatives for everything from criminal
enterprises to terrorist attacks well beyond
Lebanon's borders.

And though Hezbollah is composed of
multiple committees and branches, it
operates as a single entity. Hezbollah, the
U.S. intelligence community has
determined, is a multifaceted, disciplined
organization that combines political, social,
paramilitary, and terrorist elements and is
one in which decisions to resort to arms or
terrorist tactics [are] carefully calibrated.

Hezbollah's Qassem, speaking in October
2012, concurred: We don't have a military
wing and a political one; we don't have
Hezbollah on one hand and the resistance
party on the other.... Every element of
Hezbollah, from commanders to members
as well as our various capabilities, are in
the service of the resistance, and we have
nothing but the resistance as a priority, he
said.

Maybe it is time Western leaders finally
listened to him.
