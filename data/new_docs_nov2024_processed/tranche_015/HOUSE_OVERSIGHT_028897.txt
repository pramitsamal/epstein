damage to Hezbollah's (or Nasrallah's)
assets or prestige, that could lead it ,
despite its basic position, to take action
contrary to its true fundamental
position.

¢ Incidentally, this doesn't apply
solely to Hezbollah — but to us too.

e¢ Therefore, the working
assumptions and the operational
deployment must include the
possibility of deterioration into a wide-
scale confrontation with Hezbollah.

e And now, to Iran — which under
certain circumstances might be the
element that ignites or incites
Hezbollah into action.

¢ Let us be clear — a nuclear Iran is a
central threat to the entire world order,
not just Israel. A nuclear Iran means
the end of the non-proliferation
regime— Saudi Arabia, within months,
Turkey within a few years and Egypt
might follow as well—and all will
become nuclear.
