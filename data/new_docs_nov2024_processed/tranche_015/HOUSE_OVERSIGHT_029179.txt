Examples were the U.S. is divided on tariffs
which is certainly true. China is not because
publicly people don’t speak against the Chinese |
government, so that may be a little bit

artificial, but nonetheless it is a matter of public | ™
policy in China to support the government. ;

There’s a nationalistic pride in China.
Americans will be affected by their pocket
book. They’re going to pay more for baseball
gloves and television sets and dishwashers.
And people are not going to be happy about
that. There will be industries that will be
affected — and technology and soybeans we
know. So there will be many, many interest
groups in the U.S. that will argue and fight
against tariffs.

So the basic reason is that the U.S. has a
divided approach to tariffs, and that’s certainly
true. Most experts deny that tariffs are an
effective way. Quiet diplomacy, putting
pressure on China in the right way is the way
because China does need to make some
changes. People in China recognize that.
