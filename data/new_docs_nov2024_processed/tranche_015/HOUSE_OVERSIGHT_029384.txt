I am concerned about our addiction to
internal quarrels just as much as I am
concerned about our conflicts with
external opponents. Our
righteousness will not prevail and
our strength will crack over time if
we do not act decisively to establish,
gradually yet persistently , norms of
public life and civil society — which
sets norms for what is done and what
isn’t done far above the criminal
threshold... We need profound change
in the area of respect for the rule of
law, standards of governance, keeping
the thin line between freedom of
expression and freedom of incitement
— and immediately hitting the brakes
on racism and Jewish terrorism —
which in my opinion should be treated
within the criminal domain..
