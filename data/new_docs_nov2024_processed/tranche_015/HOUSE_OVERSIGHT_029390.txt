¢ This will take time. There will
be ups and downs. The Palestinians are
not an easy interlocutor. No one knows
that better than I do..

e This might require long periods
of interim agreements and even
calculated unilateral steps that are
coordinated with the US and the
Quartet.

¢ Itis possible that within the
context of a regional agreement, the
Palestinian State, once established,
could be integrated into a structure of a
closer cooperation that could include
Jordan, Israel and perhaps another
regional player.

¢ But to advance the chance of a
regional agreement after the elections
in Israel — the Palestinian issue and the
two-state solution must be at the top of
the agenda.
