Right now, nobody has a successful formula for helping Pakistan —
with its 100-plus nuclear weapons — arrest its systemic decline; or
for coercing North Korea to slow its growing nuclear weapons and
missile capabilities. So the administration gets the benefit of the
doubt on those two perplexing problems.

Obama has, however, failed in the most important presidential power:
to act as a wise commander in chief. He is seriously mismanaging all
three wars the U.S. is now engaged in.

In Iraq, over the past decade, the United States has lost 4,500
American lives, has had 33,000 wounded and has spent a trillion
dollars to promote vital U.S. national interests. But we are in danger
of losing that enormous sacrifice in blood and treasure to meet the
president’s deadline of withdrawing all U.S. troops by the end of this
year.

That is a huge strategic mistake. It could, over time, plunge that
pivotal nation back into civil war. We should keep roughly 40,000
combat troops in Iraq for the foreseeable future, to make an
indispensable contribution to [raq’s stability and prevent Iranian
dominance. We should now be lobbying the Iraqi government hard to
accept this.

In Afghanistan, Obama has dramatically escalated U.S. troop
commitment — now more than 100,000 — in a war that Bob
Woodward says in his book, “Obama’s Wars,” that the president does
not believe in. U.S. policy toward Afghanistan involves spending
$100 billion and suffering several hundred allied deaths annually —
500 Americans dead last year, thousands more injured. All this to
deal with 100 or so Al Qaeda fighters now in Afghanistan; and
prevent the Afghan Taliban from controlling the Pashtun Afghan
homeland — which was not the reason we went there after Sept. 11.
Our mission was to eradicate Al Qaeda — now largely accomplished —
not fight the Taliban.
