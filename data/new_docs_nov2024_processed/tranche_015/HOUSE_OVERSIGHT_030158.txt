America’s secret contacts with the Taliban have made progress partly
because President Hamid Karzai wants them to succeed and, perhaps
more important, because India, Pakistan, Russia and China are also
supporting the outreach process — with silent acquiescence from
Iran, too. This regional framework is the real exit ramp that will allow
withdrawal of U.S. troops.

Let’s think about how this diplomatic model might apply to Libya
and Syria. In both cases, the insurgents are seen in the West as the
“sood guys,” battling corrupt, autocratic leaders. Personally, I wish
that both Moammar Gaddafi and Bashar al-Assad would give up
power tomorrow. But that doesn’t seem in the cards: Both leaders
have shown they’re willing to kill thousands of their citizens to hang
on, and the rebel movements in both countries seem too weak to
displace the dictators by force. Outside military intervention may
seem tempting, but it isn’t working very well in Libya, and might fare
even worse in Syria.

The right goal in Libya and Syria (as in Afghanistan) is a transition to
an inclusive, democratic government — with as little bloodshed
along the way as possible. The alternative to such a settlement is a
protracted conflict that could mean massacres of civilians and, on
present evidence, a bloody stalemate that further destabilizes the
region.

It’s distasteful to contemplate dialogue with leaders such as Gaddafi
and Assad who, to put it bluntly, have blood on their hands. But this
approach is worth exploring if it can foster a transition to a
democratic government — where the autocrats cede power to a
coalition that includes reformist elements of the old regime and the
opposition.

An emissary who is close to Gaddafi’s inner circle has outlined in
recent interviews a Libyan formula for transition. He proposes a
gradual transfer of power to a new government that would unite the
