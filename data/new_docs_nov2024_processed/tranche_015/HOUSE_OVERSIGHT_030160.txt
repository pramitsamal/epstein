The Middle East’s Slow-Motion

Revolution
Prince El Hassan bin Talal

2011-06-21 -- AMMAN — There seem to be a thousand and one
interpretations of the changes sweeping across the countries of the
Middle East and North Africa. One response that is often heard is a
note of cautious optimism, captured in US President Barack Obama
recent speech at the State Department when he referred to the
“promise of the future.”

But sometimes we also hear the populist smears that have been
applied to the Middle East for so long that nothing, it seems — no
amount of extraordinary change — can silence them. After the
successful revolts in Cairo and Tunis, the slanders abated. Soon,
however, the old messages depicting the Middle East as extreme,
fundamentalist, and hostile to democracy began to re-insinuate
themselves in the West.

On the other hand, ordinary men and women in the West seem to feel
an instinctive sympathy toward their counterparts in the Middle East
and North Africa, many of whom are paying the ultimate price in
fighting for their rights. These sacrifices have convinced many
Westerners that the Middle East is not beyond redemption, and that
the region’s people should be given a chance to enjoy the same
liberty that they do.

This clash of perceptions has caught the world’s policy experts and
analysts off guard. That, too, is not surprising, because the situation
remains an amorphous mix of hope and destruction.
