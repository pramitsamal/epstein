security. China, India, South Africa and Brazil all side with Syria. At
home, the country will not face starvation -- this year’s wheat harvest
is estimated at 3.6m tons. Oil and gas exports have so far not been
affected.

On the debit side, however, tourism has collapsed; inward investment
has dried up; the increase Asad has decree in the salaries of
government bureaucrats is estimated to cost $1bn a year -- driving the
government deficit to dangerous heights. If the crisis continues much
longer, Syria will need a large cash injection from somewhere, and is
probably looking to Qatar. Then there is the unpredictable factor.
What if the protests continue and become more violent? Will the
merchant middle class, the backbone of the regime, remain loyal?
Could the economy take the strain? What might next Friday bring?

I was reached this week on the phone by a well-placed Syrian, close
to the regime. “Western condemnation of Syria is pure hypocrisy,” he
fumed. “Every regime in the world will try to destroy its enemies.
Have you heard of a place called Abu Ghraib? Or the hundreds of
thousands killed by America in Iraq? Or Israel’s massacre in Gaza?
Or the 10,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails? If the U.S. and Israel can
get away with large-scale killing and torture, why can’t we? They
claim to act in self-defence, so do we!”

It would seem that lawlessness and contempt for human life are
contagious.
