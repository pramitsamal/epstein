e Introduce greater transparency into how you allocate funding in response
to grant applications

¢ Establish a Scientific Advisory Board of the Foundation, which serves to
demonstrate the deep knowledge base you draw on and attracts the best
scientists to apply

¢ Sets out quantifiable long term targets, i.e. the Gates Foundation target
to eradicate malaria by 2015

Annual event

| would advise you to think about some kind of annual event that brings together
your business and philanthropic interests, i.e. an intimate and high level summit
or conference. The best events of this nature clearly demonstrate:

¢ The convening power of the host

¢ Your interest and expertise in a range of subjects

¢ Your network that your clients and acquaintances greatly value

¢ The connections made between your guests

¢ That you are undaunted by the negative publicity, it is ‘business as usual’

Whilst different from what | have in mind, the Milken Conference has been a key

part of Mike Milken’s rehabilitation. This could be a much smaller, more high level
gathering focused on a subject of interest to these core constituencies.
