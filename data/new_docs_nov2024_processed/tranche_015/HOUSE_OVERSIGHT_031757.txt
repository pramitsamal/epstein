Saturday Night Live featured “Lyndon LaRouche Theater,” in
which Randy Quaid played LaRouche, with a bald wig, bow-tie
and spectacles, narrating melodramatic twists, conspiracies, and

confessing “Il am insane.”

Not mentioned in the book, near the end of March 1981, |
delivered a keynote address at the Youth International Party
convention in New York. These were the latterday Yippies,
originally launched as the anti-Yippie “Zippies” during the
1972 both conventions in Miami. | asked the audience a
rhetorical question, “How would you like to be a Secret Service
agent guarding Ronald Reagan, Knowing that his vice president,
George Bush, is the former head of the CIA?”

Once again, satire would be outdistanced by reality. On
March 30, the president was shot by John Hinckley in order to
make a favorable impression on actress Jodie Foster so that he
could take her bowling on a date. Ironicallly, Hinckley came out

for gun control, and Reagan came out against it.
