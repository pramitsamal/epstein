Wearing a rainbow-striped hoodie and a “Beer Nuts” baseball cap, Sarah Silverman strode into our

Burbank recording studio ready to talk.

It had been just a few weeks since Hulu had unceremoniously canceled her weekly show J Love You,

America and the comedian’s emotions were still a bit raw. But her unflappable sense of humor was
fully intact as she recounted to me how she found out the bad news and ended up revealing more than

ever before about how the streaming service treated her over the past year.

During our long conversation for the first-ever episode of my new podcast The Last Laugh, Silverman

also spoke frankly about what it has been like to see her friend Al Franken accused of alleged sexual

misconduct and attempted to clarify the controversial comments she made to Howard Stern about

Louis C.K. She reflected on some of her most iconic roles and looked ahead to what comes next.

Highlights from the interview are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing

On the ‘heartbreaking’ cancelation of | Love You, America

“Tt came as a surprise. We were so sure we were getting picked up. We’re all super bummed about it. I
know that they did love the show, but I think what it cost compared to its popularity or the eyes that
they had on it didn’t—you know, the people that make the decisions there don’t have any connection to

the show. And it is just so heartbreaking because I kind of feel cut off at the knees.”
