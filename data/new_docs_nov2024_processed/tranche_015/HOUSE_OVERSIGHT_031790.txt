Bloomberg said former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci,
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, senior advisor Jared Kushner and attorney Rudy
Giuliani support the pardon for Milken.

Milken has a net worth of $3.7 billion, according to Forbes. The financier, who pioneered
the market for high-yield bonds while at Drexel Burnham Lambert, was sentenced to 10
years in prison and permanently banned from the securities industry by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. His prison term was reduced to two years.

The White House and a spokesperson for the Milken Institute did not immediately respond
to requests for comment.
