My initial recommendation this morning was to buy the $200 Aug puts. I still think that is the best idea. The
stock is now down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding
mergers. So I think it makes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we
hopefully get more clarity from management.
