My second column was about Lenny Bruce—titled “Lenny the Lawyer,” since he defended
himself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no blasphemy
laws. I went to the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a $500 bill.
Lenny was alone in his hotel room on Christmas Day when I presented it to him. And, with a

very much to be liked.

I say alleged because upon Ruby’s own death. Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade said he
would dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no

Now Jack Ruby’s dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of
history. Oh yeah, and at Lenny’s funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his jacket.

magazine, 7he Realist. Before the issue went to press, he called his mother and a few others to
let them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work was

his life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, well,
