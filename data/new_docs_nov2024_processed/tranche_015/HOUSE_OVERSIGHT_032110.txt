Just a short walk from the Arc de Triomphe, Mon Hotel sits on a quiet Now Live
street off the bustling boulevards. Designer Aurélia Santoni fashioned
this intimate boutique property with eccentricity and flair; lampshades
from Dutch design firm Moooi hang above Utrecht armchairs in the
lobby. Above all, the style of the guestrooms and the service stress
comfort; Mon feels like your personal Paris pied-a-terre.
