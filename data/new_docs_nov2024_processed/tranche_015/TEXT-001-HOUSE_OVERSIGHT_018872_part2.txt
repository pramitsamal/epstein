bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things 
going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he 
would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage. 
On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn 
taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from 
November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, 
chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about 
masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have 
one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated 
he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either or Epstein would 
meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen 
area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either or 
Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses 
appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. b6 
He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses td !for b7C 
one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high 
school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators 
and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them 
away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

Therefore, as Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these incidents was fifty one years of age, did have

Mystery money man faces soliciting charge 
By NICOLE JANOK 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
part-time Palm Beacher who has 
socialized with Donald Trump, Bill 
Clinton and Kevin Spacey was jailed 
early Sunday with accused drug dealers, 
drunken drivers and wife beaters after 
he was charged with soliciting a prosti-
tute. 
Manhattan money manager Jeffrey 
Epstein, 53, was picked up at his home 
on El Brillo Way at 1:45 a.m. He was 
released hours later on $3,000 bond. 
z9o9 Ql 
Epstein was indicted last week by a 
state grand jury, according to state at-
torney's spokesman Mike Edmondson. 
Despite Epstein's arrest, the indictment 
containing the allegations remained 
sealed Sunday and Edmondson provid-
ed no details. 
Unlike most accused johns, Epstein 
was charged with a third-degree felony 
instead of a misdemeanor. Under state 
law, a solicitation charge usually is ele-
vated to a more-serious felony when the 
defendant has at least two solicitation 
convictions. 
However, checks of court records 
here and in New York Sunday turned up 
no such convictions. 
Epstein could not be reached. F 
mondson said he was being representt-1 
by West Palm Beach attorney Jack 
Goldberg, who declined comment. 
Epstein is the president of J Epstein 
& Co., a money management company 
based in Manhattan that caters to ultra-
wealthy clientele, according to pub-

SOLICITING from m 
lished reports. National 
magazines have described 
him as a mysterious billion-
aire who lives in a 45,000-
square-foot New York City 
mansion. 
He has been in trouble 
before. In 1993, he and two 
other defendants were 
charged in federal court with 
three counts of postal larceny 
and theft and one count of 
property theft. Epstein plead 
guilty to a single charge of 
conspiring to steal U.S. 
Treasury checks from resi-
dential. mailboxes and re-
ceived 5 years' probation. 
The remaining charges were 
dropped. 
Since then, Epstein's 
name has turned up in New 
York City's tabloids. The New 
York Post noted he flew Pres-
ident Clinton and Kevin 
Spacey to Africa on his pri-
vate Boeing 727`. In 2003, the 
paper dubbed him one of the 
Big Apple's top studs. 
In 2004, Epstein bid 
against Trump for a 43,000-
square foot Palm Beach es-
tate once owned by health-
care magnate Abe Gosman. 
Trump topped Epstein with a 
$41.35 million bid.

Indictment: Billionaire solicited 3 times 
Palm Beach police will report 
today about their prostitution 
probe of the money manager. 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Billionaire money manager and 
Palm Beach part-time resident Jeffrey 
Epstein- solicited or procured prostitutes 
three or more times between Aug. 1 and 
Oct. 31 of last year, according to an in-
dictment charging him with felony so-
licitation of prostitution. 
Epstein, 53, was booked at the Palm 
Beach County jail at 1:45 a.m. Sunday. 
He was released on $3,000 bond. 
Epstein's case is unusual in that 
suspected prostitution johns are usually 
charged with a misdemeanor, and even 
a felony charge is typically made in a 
criminal information — an alternative to 
an indictment charging a person with 
the commission of a 
crime. 
His attorney, Jack 
Goldberger, declined to 
discuss the charge. 
State attorney's of-
fice spokesman Mike 
Edmondson also had 
little to say. 
Generally speak- Epstein 
ing, there is a case that 
has a number of different aspects to it, 
Edmondson said of a prostitution-
related charge being submitted to a 
grand jury. We first became aware of 
the case months ago by Palm Beach 
police. 
Prosecutors and police worked to-
gether to bring the case to the grand 
jury, he said. 
Palm Beach police confirmed that 
and said the department will release a 
report today regarding its investigation. 
Epstein has owned a five-bedroom, 
71/2-bath, 7,234-square-foot home with a 
pool and a boat dock on the Intracoastal 
Waterway since 1990, according to 
property records. A man answering the 
door there Monday said that Epstein 
wasn't home. A Cadillac Escalade reg-
istered to him was parked in the drive-
way, which is flanked by two massive 
gargoyles. 
Epstein sued Property Appraiser 
Gary Nikolits in 2001, contending that 
the assessment of his home exceeded 
its fair market value. He dismissed his 
lawsuit in December 2002. 
A profile of Epstein in Vanity Fair 
magazine said he owns what are be-
lieved to be the largest private homes in 
Manhattan — 51,000 square feet — and 
in New Mexico — a 7,500-acre ranch. 
Those are in addition to his 70-acre is-
land in the U.S. Virgin Islands and fleet 
of aircraft. 
Epstein's friends and admirers, ac-
cording to the magazine, include prom-
inent businessmen, academics and sci-
entists and famed Harvard law professor 
Alan Dershowitz.

After long probe, 
billionaire faces 
solicitation charge 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein 
paid to have underage girls and young 
women brought to his home, where he re-
ceived massages and sometimes sex, ac-
cording to an investigation 
by the Palm Beach Police 
Department. 
Palm Beach police spent 
months sifting through Ep-
stein's trash and watching 
his waterfront home and 
Palm Beach International 
Airport to keep tabs on his 
private jet. An indictment Epstein 
charging Epstein, 53, was 
unsealed Monday, charging him with one 
count of felony solicitation of prostitution. 
Palm Beach police thought there was 
probable cause to charge Epstein with un-
lawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and 
lascivious molestation. 
Police Chief Michael Reiter was so angry 
with State Attorney Barry Krischer's han-
dling of the case that he wrote a memo

Police kept watch on home, airport, sifted through trash 
EPSTEIN from 1B 
suggesting the county's top 
prosecutor disqualify himself. 
I must urge you to ex-
amine the unusual course that 
your office's handling of this 
'wafter has taken and consider 
thiwgood and sufficient reason 
exists to reqiiire your dis-
qualification from the prose-
cution of these cases, Reiter 
wrote in a May 1 memo to 
Krischer. 
While not commenting 
specifically on the Epstein 
case, Mike Edmondson, 
spokesman for the state at-
torney, said his office pre-
sents cases 'other than mur-
ders to a grand jury when 
there are questions about 
witnesses' credibility and 
their ability to testify. 
By the nature of their jobs, 
police officers look at evi-
,m4Ince from a one-sided per-
ective, Edmondson said. 
A prosecutor has to look at it 
in a much broader fashion, 
weighing the veracity of wit-
, nesses and how they may fare 
under defense attorneys' 
questioning, he said. 
Epstein's attorney, Jack 
Goldberger, said his client 
committed no crimes. 
The reports and state-
ments in question refer to 
false accusations that were 
not charged because the Palm 
Beach County state attorney 
questioned the credibility of 
the witnesses, Goldberger 
said. A county grand jury 
found the allegations wholly 
unsubstantiated and not 
credible, and that's why his 
client was not charged with 
sexual activity with minors, 
he said. 
Goldberger said Epstein 
passed a lie detector test ad-
ministered by a reputable 
polygraph examiner in which 
he said he did not know the 
girls were minors. Also, a 
search warrant served on 
Epstein's home found no evi-
dence to corroborate the 
girls' allegations, Goldberger 
said. 
According to police docu-
ments: 
• A Palm Beach Commu-
nity College student said she 
gave Epstein a massage in the 
nude, then brought him six 
girls, ages 14 to 16, for mas-
sage and sex-tinged sessions 
at his home. 
MA 27-year-old woman 
who worked as Epstein's 
personal assistant also facili-
tated the liaisons, phoning 
the PBCC student to arrange 
for girls when Epstein was 
coming to town. And she es-
corted the girls upstairs when 
they arrived, putting fresh 
sheets on a massage table and 
placing massage oils nearby. 
• Police took sworn 
statements from five alleged 
victims and 17 witnesses. 
They contend that on three 
occasions, Epstein had sex 
with the girls. 
The chief's letter 
See the letter Palm Beach Police 
Chief Michael Reiter wrote to 
State Attorney Bany Krischer 
on the Epstein case. 
PalmBeachPostcom 
A money manager for the 
ultra-rich, Epstein was named 
one of New York's most eligi-
ble bachelors in 2003 by The 
New Yot* Post. He reportedly 
hobnobs with the likes of 
former President Clinton, 
former Harvard University 
President Lawrence Sum-
mers and Donald Trump, and 
has lavish homes in Manhat-
tan, New Mexico and the Vir-
gin Islands. 
He has contributed tens of 
thousands of dollars to Dem-
ocratic Party candidates and 
organizations, including Sen. 
John Kerry's presidential bid, 
and the Senate campaigns of 
Joe Lieberman, Hillary Clin-
ton, Christopher Dodd and 
Charles Schumer. 
Goldberger is one of five 
attorneys Epstein has re-
tained since he became the 
subject of an investigation, 
Edmondson said. Among the 
others: Alan Dershovvitz, the 
well-known Harvard law pro-
fessor and author, who is a 
friend of Epstein. Dershowitz 
could not be reached for 
comment 
Police said the woman 
who enlisted young girls for 
Epstein was Haley Robson, 
20, of Royal Palm Beach. 
Robson has worked at an Ol-
ive Garden restaurant in 
Wellington and said she was a 
journalism major at Palm 
Beach Community College 
when she was questioned by 
police last October. She has 
an unlisted phone number 
and could not be reached for 
comment. 
Robson said she met Ep-
stein when, at age 17, a friend 
asked her if she would like to 
make money giving him a 
massage. She said she was 
driven to his five-bedroom, 
71/2-bath home on the Intra-
coastal Waterway, then es-
coded upstairs to a bedroom 
with a massage table and oils. 
Epstein and Robson were 
both naked during the mas-
sage, she said, but when he 
grabbed her buttocks, she 
said she didn't want to be 
touched. 
Epstein said he'd pay her 
to bring him more girls -- the 
younger the better, Robson 
told police. When she tried 
once to bring a 23-year-old 
woman to him, Epstein said 
she was too old, Robson said. 
Robson, who has not been 
charged in the case, said she 
eventually brought six girls to 
Epstein who were paid $200 
each time, Robson said. I'm 
like a Heidi Fleiss, police 
quoted her as saying. The 
girls knew what to expect 
when they were taken to Ep-
stein's home, Robson said. 
Give a massage — maybe na-
ked — and allow some 
touching. 
One 14-year-old girl Rob-
son took to meet Epstein led 
police to start the investiga-
tion of him in March 2005. A 
relative of the girl called to say 
she thought the child had re-
cently engaged in sex with a 
Palm Beach man. The girl 
then got into a fight with a 
classmate who accused her of 
being a prostitute, and she 
couldn't explain why she had 
$300 in her purse. 
The girl gave police this 
account of her meeting with 
Epstein: 
She accompanied Robson 
and a second girl to Epstein's 
house on a Sunday in Febru-
ary 2005. Once there, a wom-
an she thought was Epstein's 
assistant told the girl to follow 
her upstairs to a room featur-
ing a mural of a naked woman, 
several photographs of naked 
women on a shelf, a hot pink 
and green sofa and a massage 
table. 
She stripped to her bra 
and panties and gave him a 
massage. 
Epstein gave the 14-year-
old $300 and she and the oth-
er girls left, she said. She said 
Robson told her that Epstein 
paid her $200 that day. 
Other girls told similar 
stories. In most accounts, 
Epstein's personal assistant at 
the time, Sarah Kellen, now 
27, escorted the girls to Ep-
stein's bedroom. 
Kellen, whose most re-
cent known address is in 
North Carolina, has not been 
charged in the case. 
Palm Beach police often 
conducted surveillance of 
Epstein's home, and at Palm 
Beach International Airport 
to see if his private jet was 
there, so they would know 
when he was in town. Police 
also arranged repeatedly to 
receive his trash from Palm 
Beach sanitation workers, 
collecting papers with names 
and phone numbers, sex toys 
and female hygiene products. 
One note stated that a fe-
male could not come over at 7 
p.m. because of soccer. An-
other said a girl had to work 
Sunday — Monday after 
school? And still another 
note contained the work 
hours of a girl, saying she 
leaves school at 11:30 a.m. 
and would come over the next 
day at 10:30 a.m. 
Only three months before 
the police department probe 
began, Epstein donated 
$90,000 to the department for 
the purchase of a firearms 
simulator, said Jane Struder, 
town finance director. The 
purchase was never made. 
The money was returned to 
Epstein on Monday, she said.

Police say 
lawyer tried 
to discredit 
teenage girls 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Famed Harvard law professor Alan 
Dershowitz met with the Palm Beach 
County State Attorney's Office and pro-
vided damaging information about teen-
age girls who say they gave his client, 
Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, 
sexually charged massages, according to 
police reports. 
The reports also state that another 
Epstein attorney agreed to a plea bargain 
that would have allowed Epstein to have no 
criminal record. His current attorney de-
nies this happened. 
And the documents also reveal that the 
father of at least one girl complained that 
private investigators aggressively fol-
lowed his car, photographed his home and 
chased off visitors. 
Police also talked to 
somebody who said she 
was offered money if she 
refused to cooperate with 
the Palm Beach Police 
Department probe of Ep-
stein. 
The state attorney's 
office said it presented the 
Epstein case to a county 
grand jury this month 
rather than directly 
charging Epstein because 
of concerns about the 
girls' credibility. The 
grand jury indicted Ep-
stein, 53, on a single count of felony solic-
itation of prostitution, which carries a 
maximum penalty of five years in prison. 
Police believed there was probable 
cause to charge Epstein with the more 
serious crimes of unlawful sex acts with a 
minor and lewd and lascivious molesta-
tion. Police Chief Michael Reiter was so 
angry that he wrote State Attorney Barry 
Krischer a memo in May suggesting he 
disqualify himself from Om case.

Polygraph shows he didn't know girls' ages, lawyer says 
EPSTEIN from 1B 
using the name Pimpin' 
Made EZ. Robson, who was 
not charged in the case, is a 
potential prosecution wit-
ness. 
According to Recarey, 
prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek 
offered Epstein attorneys 
Dershowitz and Guy Fronstin 
a plea deal in April. Fronstin, 
after speaking with Epstein, 
accepted the deal, in which 
Epstein would plead guilty to 
one count of aggravated as-
sault with intent to commit a 
felony, be placed on five 
years' probation and have no 
criminal record. The deal al-
so called for Epstein to sub-
mit to a psychiatric and sex-
ual evaluation and have no 
unsupervised visits with mi-
nors, according to Recarey's 
report. The plea bargain was 
made in connection with only 
one of the five alleged vic-
tims, the report states. 
Fronstin — who declined 
to comment on the case — 
• was subsequently fired and 
, veteran defense attorney 
Jack Goldberger was hired. 
He denies there was any 
agreement by any of Ep-
stein's attorneys to a plea 
deal. 
We absolutely did not 
agree to a plea in this case, 
he said. Neither Belohlavek 
nor a state attorney's 
spokesman could be reached 
for comment. 
The parent or parents of 
alleged victims who corn-
plained of being harassed by 
private investigators provid-
ed license tag numbers of two 
of the men. Police found the 
vehicles were registered to a 
private eye in West Palm 
Beach and anOther in Jupiter, 
according to Recarey's re-
port. 
I have no knowledge of 
it, defense attorney Gold-
berger said. 
The report also says a 
woman connected to the Ep-
stein case was contacted by 
somebody who was still in 
touch with Epstein. That 
person told her she would be 
compensated if she didn't 
cooperate with police, Re-
carey's report says. Those 
who did talk will be dealt 
with,?' the woman said she 
was told. Phone records 
show the woman talked with 
the person who allegedly in-
timidated her around the 
time she said, Recarey re-
ported. 
Phone records also show 
that the person said :to have 
made the threat then placed a 
call to Epstein's personal as-
sistant, who in turn called a 
New York corporation affili-
ated with Epstein, the report 
states. 
The issue in the Epstein 
case is not whether females 
came to his waterfront home, 
but whether he knew their 
ages. 
He's never denied girls 
came to the house, Gold-
berger said. But when Ep-
stein was given a polygraph 
test, he passed on knowl-
edge of age, the attorney 
said. 
After the indictment 
against Epstein was unsealed 
this week, Police Chief Reiter 
referred the matter to the 
FBI. We've received the re-
ferral, and we're reviewing 
it, said FBI spokeswoman 
Judy Orihuela in Miami. 
The chief himself has 
come under attack from Ep-
stein's lawyers and friends in 
New York, where he has a 
home. The New York Post 
quoted Epstein's prominent 
New York lawyer, Gerald 
Lefcourt, as saying his client 
was indicted only because of 
the craziness of the police 
chief. 
Reiter has declined to 
comment on the case. , 
Prosecutors have not 
presented a sex-related case 
like Epstein's to a grand jury 
before, said Mike Edmond-
son, spokesman for the state 
attorney's office. That's what 
you do with a case that falls 
into a gray area, he said. 
The state attorney's office 
did not recommend a partic-
ular criminal charge on 
which to indict Epstein, Ed-
mondson said. The grand ju-
ry was presented with a list of 
charges from highest to low-
est, then deliberated with the 
prosecutor out of the room, 
he said. 
People are surprised at 
the grand jury proceeding, 
West Palm Beach defense 
attorney Richard Tendler 
said. It's a way for the pros-
ecutor's office to not take the 
full responsibility for not fil-
ing the (charge), and not do-
ing what the Palm Beach Po-
lice Department wanted. I 
think something fell apart 
with those underage wit-
nesses. 
Defense attorney Robert 
Gershman was a prosecutor 
for six years. 'Those girls 
must have been incredible or 
untrustworthy, I don't know, 
he said. 
Other attorneys said Ep-
stein's case raises the issue of 
whether wealthy, connected 
defendants like Epstein — 
whose friends include former 
President Clinton and

differently from others. Once 
he knew he was the subject of 
a criminal probe, Epstein 
hired a phalanx of powerful 
attorneys such as Dershowitz

president of the National As-
sociation of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers. 
Miami lawyer Roy Black

17-year-old girls. 
That should 
count for some-
thing — the dif-
ference between 
prostitution and 
pedophilia. 
So, it is baffling 
that Mr. Epstein, who was indicted 
last month by a grand jury on one 
felony count of solicitation of pros-
titution, has not been charged, as 
Palm Beach police strenuously 
urged, with unlawful sex acts with 
a minor and lewd and lascivious 
molestation. 
Conviction of crimes against mi-
nors would mean steeper penalties 
than the maximum five-year prison 
term Mr. Epstein faces if convicted 
of the single count of felony solicita-
tion. It also would help carry a mes-
sage of intolerance to perverts who 
prey on girls. 
Prosecutors did not pursue charg-
es against Mr. Epstein reflecting 
the age of the victims because they 
assumed a jury would view the girls 
not as victims but as promiscuous, 
untrustworthy, willing participants. 
The presumption is offensive. 
Mr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Man-
hattan money manager who has 
hired Harvard law professor Alan 
Dershowitz and defense attor-
ney Jack Goldberger, has denied 
knowing how old the girls were. 
Jury should have decided 
if Epstein is a pedophile. 
But police interviews with five 
alleged victims and 17 witnesses 
under oath, as well as phone mes-
sages, a high school transcript and 
other items that police found from 
searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 
7,234-square-foot waterfront home, 
provide evidence that he knew the 
girls were teenagers. 
One girl couldn't show up when 
Mr. Epstein wanted because she 
had soccer. Another time, Mr. Ep-
stein had to wait for his massage 
session because the girl he wanted 
was still in class. 
Why didn't State Attorney Barry 
Krischer let a jury decide whether 
to believe the teenagers — in-
cluding a 16-year-old who went to 
Mr. Epstein's house to work in 
December 2004 after being asked 
whether she needed to make money 
for Christmas gifts? 
Prosecutors gave greater weight 
to the details Mr. Dershowitz pro-
vided about the girls in an apparent 
effort to assail their character. Mr. 
Dershowitz pointed out to prosecu-
tors that some of the teenagers had 
talked on myspace.com about mari-
juana and alcohol use. 
The 20-year-old Royal Palm 
Beach woman who told police she 
recruited girls for Mr. Epstein has 
a Web page on myspace.com that 
features one girl using the name 
Pimpin' Made EZ. 
Although no charges of witness 
tampering have been filed, the par-
ents of at least one of the teenage 
victims complained to police of be-
ing followed and intimidated by two 
men. Police determined that their 
vehicles were registered to two pri-
vate investigators. Mr Goldberger 
denied knowing anything about it. 
Police also note in their reports 
that the state attorney's office of-
fered Mr. Epstein a plea deal that 
would have placed him on proba-
tion for five years, allowing him 
ultimately to walk away with no 
criminal record at all. 
I asked Mr. Krischer's spokes-
man, Mike Edmondson, why the 
case was referred to a grand jury in-
, stead of Mr. Epstein being charged 
and facing a trial before a jury. And 
shouldn't the victims' credibility 
be a factor to determine whether a 
crime's been committed, not wheth-
er a jury will convict? (After all, as 
Mr. Goldberger told The Palm Beach 
Post of Mr Epstein, He's never de-
nied girls came to the house.) 
Especially, I asked Mr. Edmond-
son to explain: Why shouldn't the 
public look at this case and think 
there are two kinds of justice — one 
for the wealthy and one for the rest 
of us? 
Mr. Edmondson said he could 
not comment on the case because it 
is active, but on the latter point, he 
offered, for the sake of philosophi-
cal debate: Whether wealth buys a 
different standard of justice across 
the country ... the answer to that 
would, of course, be yes. 
But in this case, he said, regard-
less of the battery of attorneys, the 
outcome would be the same. Every 
issue that was debated in public was 
debated in our office before this 
case went to the grand jury. 
In this case, it is not the victims' 
credibility but the state attorney's 
that deserves questioning.

Expert: Ignorance of age 
isn't defense in sex cases 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Even if Palm Beach mon-
ey manager Jeffrey Epstein 
didn't know that girls who 
police say gave him sexual 
massages at his Intracoastal 
home were under the legal 
age, that alone wouldn't have 
exempted him from criminal 
charges of sexual activity with 
minors. 
Ignorance is not a valid 
defense, said Bob Delde, a 
legal skills professor who was 
a Lake City prosecutor for 
nearly 30 years, half of that 
time specializing in sex 
crimes against children. 
There is no knowledge 
element as far as the age is 
concerned, Dekle said. 
After an 11-month investi-
gation, Palm Beach . police 
said there was probable cause 
to charge Epstein, 53, with 
unlawful sex acts with a minor

and lewd and lascivious mo-

Epstein — friend of the rich 
and famous and financial pa-

ganizations and candidates—
committed those acts with

Lawyer: Jur° often believe &hilts over kids 
10- EPSTEIN from 1B 
his current job, has returned 
$10,000 to him because of the 
Palm Beach scandal, the New 
York Daily News has reported. 
Rather than file charges, 
the state attorney's office 
presented the case to a 
county grand jury. The panel 
indicted Epstein last week on 
a single, less serious charge 
of felony solicitation of pros-
titution. 
The case raised eyebrows 
because the state attorney's 
office rarely, if ever, kicks 
such charges to a grand jury. 
And it increases the difficulty 
of prosecuting child sex 
abuse cases, especially when 
the defendant is enormously 
wealthy and can hire high-
priced, top-tier lawyers. 
At least one of Epstein's 
alleged victims told police he 
knew she was underage 
when the two of them got 
naked for massages and sex-
ual activity. She was 16 years 
old at the time and said Ep-
stein asked her questions 
about her high school, ac-
cording to police reports. 
A girl who, said she met 
Epstein when she was 15 said 
he told her if she told any-
body what happened at his 
house, bad things could hap-
pen, the police reports state. 
Epstein's youngest al-
leged victim was 14 when she 
says she gave him a massage 
that included some sexual 
activity. She is now 16. The 
girl's father says he doesn't 
know whether she told Ep-
stein her age. 
My daughter has kept a 
lot of what happened from me 
because of sheer embarrass-
ment, he said. But she very 
much looked 14. Any prudent 
man would have had second 
thoughts about that 
Defense attorney Jack 
Goldberger maintains that 
not only did Epstein pass a 
polygraph test showing he 
did not know the girls were 
minors, but their stories 
weren't credible. The state 
attorney's office also implied 
that their credibility was an 
issue when it decided not to 
charge Epstein directly, but 
instead give the case to the 
grand jury. 
A prosecutor has to look 
at it in a much broader fash-
ion, a state attorney's 
spokesman said last week. 
Epstein hired Harvard 
law Professor Alan Der-
showitz when he became 
aware he was under investi-
gation, and Dershowitz gave 
prosecutors information that 
some of the alleged victims 
had spoke of using alcohol 
and marijuana on a popular 
Web site, according to a Palm 
Beach police report. 
Prosecutors typically 
consider two things in decid-
ing whether to charge some-
body with sex-related offens-
es against minors — whether 
there is sufficient evidence 
and whether there is a public 
interest in doing so, Delde 
said. 
Child sex abuse cases 
often are difficult 
to prosecute, an 
attorney says. 
If two teens are in a sexual 
relationship and the boy 
turns 18 before the girl, he 
could be charged with a sex 
crime if the sex continues. 
There would be no public in-
terest in pursuing that, Dekle 
said. 
But where there is a large 
gap in ages — and especially 
in cases of teachers with stu-
dents — there is a public in-
terest in prosecuting, he said. 
Likewise if the accused has a 
track record of sex with mi-
nors. 
Still there is a universal 
constant in prosecuting 
these cases, Dekle said. Men 
who exploit underage chil-
dren for sex often carefully 
choose their victims in ways 
. that will minimize the risk to 
them, he said. 
Victims usually are from a 
lower social status, and they 
may suffer from psychologi-
cal problems, Dekle said. 
Lots of child sexual 
abuse victims have been vic-
timized by multiple people 
over a period of time. Then 
the act of abuse produces 
behavior in the victims that 
further damages their credi-
bility. Examples include 
promiscuous behavior and 
drug abuse. 
Some of the alleged vic-
tims in the Epstein case re-
turned to his home multiple 
times for the massage ses-
sions and the $200 to $300 he 
typically paid them per visit 
That would be a definite 
problem for the prosecutor, 
said Betty Resch, who prose-
cuted crimes against children 
in Palm Beach County for five 
years and now is in private 
practice in Lake Worth. 
The victim becomes less 
sympathetic to a jury, Resch 
said. But she's a victim nev-
ertheless. She's a kid. 
Most men charged with 
sex crimes against minors 
look normal, Dekle said. A 
jury expecting to see a mon-
ster seldom will. And the vic-
tims' ages work against them 
and in favor of the defendant 
in a trial, Dekle said. 
If a child and an adult tell 
different stories and both 
swear they're telling the 
truth, adult jurors are more 
likely to believe the adult, 
Dekle said. 
You have all these things 
working againstyou in a child 
sex abuse case. Prosecutors 
normally try to be very care-
ful in filing those cases be-
cause they know what they're 
getting into. There is no such 
thing as an iron-clad child 
sexual abuse case.

Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case 
Defendant's lawyers take him on; he slams state attorney 
By LARRY KELLER

Beach financier Jeffrey Ep-
stein, it seems, attimes, as if 
two men are accused of 
wrongdoing: Epstein and 
Palm Beach Police Chief 
Ti -V) ON) -pH -9 lq 
Michael Reiter. 
Epstein, 53, was indict-
ed lastmonth on a charge of 
felony solicitation of prosti-
tution solely because of Re-
iter's craziness, one of 
Epstein's lawyers said. His 
department disseminated 
a distorted view of the 
case and behaved in a 
childish manner when the 
grand jury didn't indict Ep-
stein on the charges it 
sought, another Epstein 
lawyer complained. 
To hear the Epstein 
camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a 
loose cannon better suited 
to be the sheriff of Mayber-
ry. They whisper that he's 
embroiled in a messy di-
vorce. 
Reiter did in fact file for 
divorce from his wife, Jill, 
last year, after 24 years of 
marriage. They have a son, 
18, and a daughter, 14. The , 
couple is scheduled to go to 
mediation Wednesday. 
Nothing in the court file 
suggests their split is par-
ticularly ugly.

Colleagues cite chief's professionalism, 
REITER from 1B 
ney's office for two reasons. 
First, he pressed for Epstein 
to be charged with the more 
serious crimes of sexual ac-
tivity with minors. Second, he 
slammed State Attorney Bar-
ry Krischer in blunt language 
seldom used by one law-
etforcement official con-
cerning another because of 
what he perceived as that of-
fice's mishandling of the 
case. 
In a letter to Krischer 
irritten May 1, Reiter called 
hig actions in the Epstein 
case highly unusual. He 
added, I must urge you to. 
consider if good and suffi-
cient reason exists to require 
your disqualification from the 
prosecution of these cases. 
, In short, Reiter told the 
county's top prosecutor for 
the past 13 years that he 
ought to get off the 'case. It 
looks like a departure from 
professionalism, Miami-
Dade State Attorney 
Katherine Fernandez Rundle 
said of Reiter's letter. 
Following Epstein's in-
dictment, Reiter referred the 
case to the FBI to determine 
whether the super-rich, 
super-connected defendant 
had violated any federal laws. 
Reiter won't discuss the 
case or the broadsides aimed 
at him. But others almost 
uniformly use one word to 
describe the chief: profes-
sional. 
I have always been im-
pressed by Mike's profes-
sionalism and his leader-
ship, said Rick Lincoln, chief 
of the Lantana Police Depart-
ment and a Palm Beach 
County cop for 32 years. 
The town of Palm Beach 
has a very professional police 
department. We all consider 
Mike to be our peer and a 
man of integrity. 
Reiter: Town 
Manager Peter 
Elwell says the 
Palm Beach 
police chief's 
well worth his 
$144,000 sal-
ary. 
Juno Beach Police Chief 
H.C. Clark II agreed. Al-
though he doesn't know Re-
iter well, he has met with him 
on countywide law enforce-
ment issues. I've never seen 
him lose his cool. I've never 
seen anything but a profes-
sional demeanor from him. 
Reiter joined the Palm 
Beach Police Department in 
1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year 
patrol job at the University of 
Pittsburgh. His personnel 
jacket shows consistently ex-
cellent job evaluations. 
Posh Palm Beach is no 
hotbed of crime, and in his 
first year on the job, a resi-
dent confined to his home 
with a sick child thanked Re-
iter for delivering a few Cokes 
to the house. Reiter refused 
payment for the beverages. 
Another resident thanked 
Reiter for shutting off his 
car's headlights in his drive-
way, saying a valet must have 
been at fault. 
Reiter worked everything 
from road patrol to organized 
crime, vice and narcotics. 
And he's no novice at investi-
gations involving the island's 
rich and famous. He was the 
lead detective probing the 
drug overdose death of David 
Kennedy in 1984. He also was 
one of the officers who 
worked the investigation of 
William Kennedy Smith, who 
was charged in 1991 — and 
later acquitted — with. raping 
a woman at the Kennedy 
family compound in Palm 
Beach. 
Reiter, who has a master's 
degree in human resource 
integrity 
development from Palm 
Beach Atlantic University, al-
so has attended the FBI Na-
tional Academy in Quantico, 
Va., and management coursift 
es at Harvard. He's been ac-
tive in countywide interagen-
cy law enforcement 
organizations and has a top 
secret national security 
clearance. 
He has a perspective 
thafs broader than just ad-
dressing the needs of the 
town, said Town Manager 
Peter Elwell, who promoted 
Reiter from assistant chief to 
chief in March 2001. Reiter 
makes more than $144,000 as 
the town's top cop. Elwell 
thinks he's worth it. 
He's very businesslike, 
very straightforward. He's 
not easily agitated or flam-
boyant He's about the work, 
Elwell said. I think that his 
service as chief has been 
outstanding in five-plus 
years.

Jeffrey Epstein has donated more than $100,000 
to Democratic candidates' campaigns, including John Kerry's presidential bid, 
the reelection campaign of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and the Senate bids 
of Joe Lieberman, Hillary Clinton, Christopher Dodd and Charles Schumer. 
WINGED GARGOYLES guarded the gate at Jeffrey 
Epstein's Palm Beach mansion. Inside, hidden cameras 
trolled two rooms, while the girls came and went. 
For the police detectives 
who sifted through the gar-
bage outside and kept 
records of visitors, it was the 
lair of a troubling target. 
Epstein, one of the most 
mysterious of the country's 
mega-rich, was known as 
much for his secrecy as for 
his love of fine things: mag-
nificent homes, private jets, 
beautiful women, friendships 
with the world's elite. 
But at Palm Beach police 
headquarters, he was be-
coming known for something 
else: the regular arrival of 
teenage girls he hired to give 
him, massages and, police 
say, perform sexual favors. 
Epstein was different 
from most sexual abuse sus-
pects; he was far more pow-
erful. He counted among his 
friends former President Bill 
Clinton, Donald Trump and 
Prince Andrew, along with 
some of the most prominent

EPSTEIN from .1A 
asking questions and teenage girls 
started talking, a wave of legal 
resistance followed. 
If Palm Beach police didn't know 
quite who Jeffrey Epstein was, they 
found out soon enough. 
Epstein, now 53, was a quintes-
sential man of mystery. He amassed 
his fortune and friends quietly, 
always in the background as he 
navigated New York high society. 
When he first attracted notice in 
the early 1990s, it was on account of 
the woman he was dating: Ghislaine 
Maxwell, daughter of the late British 
media tycoon Robert Maxwell. 
In a lengthy article, headlined 
'The Mystery of Ghislaine Max-
well's Secret Love, the British Mail 
on Sunday tabloid laid, out specula-
tive stories that the socialite's beau 
was a CIA spook, a math teacher, a 
concert pianist or a corporate head-
hunter. 
But what is the truth about 
him? the newspaper wondered. 
Like Maxwell, Epstein is both 
flamboyant and intensely private. 
The media frenzy did not begin 
in full until a decade later. In Sep-
tember 2002, Epstein was flung into 
the limelight when he flew Clinton 
and actors Kevin Spacey and Chris 
Tucker to Africa on his private jet 
Suddenly everyone wanted to 
know who Epstein was. New York 
magazine and Vanity Fair published 
lengthy profiles. The New York Post 
listed him as one of the city's most 
eligible bachelors and began 
describing him in its gossip columns 
with adjectives such as mysterious 
and reclusive. 
Although Epstein gave no inter-
views, the broad strokes of his past 
started to come into focus. 
Building a life of extravagance 
He was born blue-collar in 1953, 
the son of a New York City parks 
department employee, and raised in 
Brooklyn's Coney Island neighbor-
hood. He left college without a 
bachelor's degree but became a 
math teacher at the prestigious 
Dalton School in Manhattan. 
The story goes that the father of 
one of Epstein's students was so 
impressed with the man that he put 
him in touch with a senior partner at 
Bear Stearns, the global investment 
bank and securities firm. 
In 1976, Epstein left Dalton for a 
job at Bear Stearns. By the early 
1980s, he had started J. Epstein and 
Co. That is when he began making 
his millions in earnest. 
Little is known or said about 
Epstein's business except this: Re 
manages money for the extremely 
wealthy. He is said to handle 
accounts only of $1 billion or great-
er. 
It has been estimated he has 
roughly 15 clients, but their identi-
ties are the subject of only specula-
tion. All except for one: Leslie Wex-
ner, founder of The Limited retail 
chain and a former Palm Beacher 
who is said to have been a mentor to 
Epstein. 
Wexner sold Epstein one of his 
most lavish residences: a massive 
townhouse that dominates a block 
on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It 
is reported to have, among its finer 
features, closed-circuit television 
and a heated sidewalk to melt away 
fallen snow. 
That townhouse, thought to be 
the largest private residence in 
Manhattan, is only a piece of the 
extravagant world Epstein built over 
time. 
In New Mexico, he constructed a 
27,000-square-foot hilltop mansion 
on a 10,000-acre ranch outside Santa 
Fe. Many believed it to be the largest 
home in the state. 
In Palm Beach, he bought a 
waterfront home on El Brill° Way. 
And he owns a 100-acre private 
island in the Virgin Islands. 
Perhaps as remarkable as his 
lavish homes is his extensive net-
work of friends and associates at the 
highest echelons of power. This 
includes not only socialites but also 
business tycoons, media moguls, 
politicians, royalty and Nobel Prize-
winning scientists whose research 
• he often funds. 
Just like other people collect 
art, he collects scientists, said 
Martin Nowak, who directs the 
Program for Evolutionary Dynamics 
at Harvard University and was 
reportedly the recipient of a $30 
million research donation from 
Epstein. 
Epstein is said to have 
befriended former Harvard Presi-
dent I.Arry Summers, prominent law 
Professor Alan Dershowitz, Donald 
Trump and New York Daily News 
Publisher Mort Zuckerman. 
And yet he managed for decades 
to maintain a low profile. He avoids 
eating out and was rarely photo-
-grahed. 
The odd thing is I never met 
him, said Dominick Dunne, the 
famous chronicler of the trials and 
tribulations of the very rich. I wasn't 
even aware of him, except for 
Vanity Fair article. 
Epstein's friendship with Clinton 
has attracted the most attention. 
Epstein met Clinton as early as 
1995, when he paid tens of thou-
sands of dollars to join him at an 
intimate fund-raising dinner in Palm 
Beach. But from all appearances, 
they did not become close friends 
until after Clinton left the Oval Office 
and moved to New York. 
Epstein has donated more than 
$100,000 to Democratic candidates' 
campaigns, including John Kerry's 
presidential bid, the reelection 
campaign of New Mexico Gov. Bill 
Richardson and the Senate bids of 
Joe Lieberman, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, Christopher Dodd and 
Charles Schumer. 
Powerful friends and enemies 
A Vanity Fair profile found 
cracks in the veneer of Epstein's life 
story. The 2003 article said he left 
Bear Stearns in the wake of a federal 
probe and a possible Securities and 
Exchange Commission violation. It 
also pointed out that Citibank once 
sued him for defaulting on a $20 
million loan. 
The article suggested that one of 
his business mentors and previous 
employers was Steven Hoffenberg, 
now serving a prison term after 
bilking investors out of more than 
$450 million in one of the largest 
Ponzi schemes in American histo-
ry. 
As he amassed his wealth, 
Epstein made enemies in disputes 
both large and small. He sued the 
man who in 1990 sold him his 
multimillion-dollar Palm Beach 
home over a dispute about less than 
$70,000 in furnishings.

•c=q. \rmer friend claimed Epstein 
A cro:,-ti out of a promise to reim-
gurse him hundreds of thousands of 
dollars after their failed investment 
in Texas oil wells. A judge decided 
Epstein owed him nothing. 
It's a bad memory. I would 
rather not have ever met Jeffrey 
Epstein, said Michael Stroll, the 
retired former president of Williams 
Electronics and Sega Corp. Suffice 
it to say I have nothing good to say 
about him. 
Among the characteristics most 
attributed to Epstein is a penchant 
for women. 
He has been linked to Maxwell, 
a fixture on the high-society party 
circuits in both New York and Lon-
don. Previous girlfriends are said to 
include a former Ms. Sweden and a 
Romanian model. 
He's a lot of fun to be with, 
Donald Trump told New York maga-
zine in 2002. It is even said that he 
likes beautiful women as much as I 
do, and many of them are on the 
younger side. No doubt about it, 
Jeffrey enjoys his social life. 
Investigation leads to Epstein 
Although he was not a fre-
quenter of the Palm Beach social 
scene, he made his presence felt. 
Among his charitable donations, he 
gave $90,000 to the Palm Beach 
Police Department and $100,000 to 
Ballet Florida. 
In Palm Beach, he lived in luxu-
ry. Three black Mercedes sat in his 
garage, alongside a green Harley-
Davidson. His jet waited at a hangar 
at Palm Beach International Airport: 
At home, a private chef and a small 
staff stood at the ready. From a 
window in his mansion, he could 
look out on the Intracoastal Water-
way and the West Palm Beach sky-
line. He seemed to be a man who 
had everything. 
But extraordinary wealth can' 
fuel extraordinary desires. 
411 In March 2005, a worried mother In Palm Beach police. She 
said another parent had overheard a 
conversation between their chil-
dren. 
Now the mother was afraid her 
14-year-old daughter had been 
molested by a man on the island. 
The phone call triggered an 
extensive investigation, one that 
would lead detectives to Epstein but 
I leave them frustrated. 
Palm Beach police and the state 
attorney's office have declined to 
discuss the case. But a Palm Beach 
police report detailing the criminal 
probe offers a window into what 
detectives faced as they sought to 
close in on Epstein. 
Detectives interviewed the girl, 
who told them a friend had invited 
her to a rich man's house to perform 
a massage. She said the friend told 
her to say she was 18 if asked. At the 
house, she said she was paid $300 
after stripping to her panties and 
massaging the man while he mas-
turbated. 
Police interview 5 alleged victims 
The investigation began in full 
after the girl identified Epstein in a 
photo as the man who had paid her. 
Police arranged for garbage trucks 
to set aside Epstein's trash so police 
could sift through it. They set up a 
video camera to record the comings 
and goings at his home. They mon-
itored an airport hangar for signs of 
his private jet's arrivals and depar-
tures. 
They quickly learned that the 
woman who took the 14-year-old girl 
to Epstein's house was Haley Rob-
son, a Palm Beach Community Col-
lege student from Loxahatchee. In a 
sworn statement at police head-
quarters, Robson, then 18, admitted 
she had taken at least six girls to visit 
Epstein, all between the ages of 14 
and 16. Epstein paid her for each 
visit, she said. 
During the drive back to her 
house, Robson told detectives, I'm 
like a Heidi Fleisa 
Police interviewed five alleged 
victims and 17 witnesses. Their 
report shows some of the girls said 
they had been instructed to have sex 
with another woman in front of 
Epstein, and one said she had direct 
intercourse with him. 
In October, police searched the 
Palm Beach mansion. They discov-
ered photos of naked, young-looking 
females, just as several of the girls 
had described in interviews. Hidden 
cameras were found in the garage 
area and inside a clock on Epstein's 
desk, alongside a girl's high school 
transcript. 
• 
Two of Epstein's former 
employees told investigators that 
young-looking girls showed up to 
perform massages two or three 
times a day when Epstein was in 
town. 
They said the girls were permit-
ted many indulgences. A chef 
cooked for them. Workers gave 
them rides and handed out hun-
dreds of dollars at a time. 
One employee told detectives he 
was told to send a dozen roses to one 
teenage girl after a high school 
drama performance. Others were 
given rental cars. One, according to 
police, received a $200 Christmas 
bonus. 
The cops moved to cement their 
case. But as they tried to tighten the 
noose, they encountered other 
forces at work. 
In Orlando they interviewed a 
possible victim who told them noth-
ing inappropriate had happened 
between her and Epstein. They 
asked her whether she had spoken 
to anyone else. She said yes, a pri-
vate investigator had asked her the 
same questions. 
When they subpoenaed one of 
Epstein's former employees, he told 
them the same thing. He and a pri-
vate eye had met at a restaurant days 
earlier to go over what the man 
would tell investigators. 
Detectives received complaints 
that private eyes were posing as 
police officers. When they told 
Epstein's local attorney, Guy Frons-
tin, he said the investigators worked 
for Roy Black, the high-powered 
Miami lawyer who has defended the ' 
likes of Rush Limbaugh and William 
Kennedy Smith. 
While the private eyes were 
conducting a parallel investigation, 
Dershowitz, the Harvard law pro-
fessor, traveled to West Palm Beach 
with information about the girls. 
From their own profiles on the pop-
ular Web site MySpace.com, he 
obtained copies of their discussions 
about their use of alcohol and mari-
juana. 
He took his research to a meet-
ing with prosecutors in early 2006, 
where he sought to cast doubt on the 
teens' reliability. 
— The private eyes had dug trip 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 018933 
enough dirt on the girls to m e 
prosecutors skeptical. Not only did 
some of the girls have issues with 
drugs or alcohol but also some had 
criminal records and other troubles, 
Epstein's legal team claimed. And at 
least one of them, they said, lied 
when she told police she was 
younger than 18 when she started 
performing massages for Epstein. 
After the meeting, prosecutors 
postponed their decision to take the 
case to a grand jury. 
In the following weeks, police 
received complaints that two of the 
victims or their families had been 
harassed or threatened. Epstein's 
legal team maintains that its private 
investigators did nothing illegal or 
unethical during their research. 
By then, relations' between 
police and prosecutors were fraying. 
At a key meeting with prosecutors 
and the defense, Detective Joseph 
Recarey, the lead investigator, was a 
no-show, according to Epstein's 
attorney. 
'The embarrassment . on the 
prosecutor's face was evident when, 
the police officer never showed up 
for the meeting, attorney Jack 
Goldberger said. 
Later in April, Recarey walked 
into a prosecutor's office at the state 
attorney's office and learned the 
case was taking an unexpected turn. 
The prosecutor, Lanna 
Belohlavek, told Recarey the state 
attorney's office had offered Epstein 
a plea deal that would not require 
him to serve jail time or receive a 
felony conviction. 
Recarey told her he disapproved 
of the plea offer. 
The deal never came to pass, 
however. 
Future unclear after charge 
On May 1, the department asked 
prosecutors to approve warrants to 
arrest Epstein on four counts of 
unlawful sexual activity with a minor 
and to charge his personal assistant, 
Sarah Kellen, now 27, for her alleged 
role in arranging the visits. Police 
officials also wanted to, charge Rob-
son, the self-described Midi Fleiss, 
with lewd and lascivious acts. 
By then, the department was 
frustrated with the way the state 
attorney's office had handled the 
case. On the same day the warrants 
were requested, Palm Beach Police 
Chief Michael Reiter wrote a letter 
to State Attorney Barry Krischer 
suggesting he disqualify himself 
from the case if he would not act. 
Two weeks later, Recarey was 
told that prosecutors had decided 
once again to take the case to the 
grand jury.' 
It is not known how many of the 
girls testified before the grand jury. 
But Epstein's defense team said one 
girl who was subpoenaed — the one 
who said she had sexual intercourse 
with Epstein — never showed up. 
The grand jury's indictment was 
handed down in July. It was not the 
one the polke department had 
wanted. ^ 
Instead of being slapped with a i 
charge, of unlawful sexual activity 
with a minor, Epstein was charged 
with one count of felony solicitation • 
of prostitution, which carries a 
maximum penalty of five years in 
prison. He was booked into the Palm ,1 
Beach County Jail early July 23 and ^ 
released hours later. 
Epstein's legal team doesn't 
clispute that he had girls over for 
massages, Goldberger said. But he 
said their claims that they had sex-
ual encounters with him lack credi-
bility. 
They are incapable of being 
believed, he said. 'They had crimi-
nal records. They had accusations of 
theft made against them by their 
employers. There was evidence of 
drug use by some,of them. • 
What remains for Epstein is yet 
to be seen. 
The Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment has asked the FBI to investi- , 
gate the case. It also has returned 
the $90,000 Epstein donated in 2004. 
In New York, candidates for 
governor and state attorney general 
have vowed to return a total of at 
least $60,000 in campaign contribu-
tions from Epstein. Meanwhile, 
Epstein's powerful friends have 
remained silent as tabloids and 
Internet blogs feast on the public 
details of the police investigation. 
Gold)oerger maintains Epstein's 
innocence but says the legal team 
has not ruled out a future plea deal. 
He insists Epstein will emerge in the 
end with his reputation untarnished. 
He will recover from this, he 
said.

- 
Epstein camp calls female accusers liars 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Attorneys and publicists for 
Palm Beach financier Jeffrey 
Epstein went on the offensive 
Monday, contending that 
teenage girls who have ac-
cused Epstein of sexual she-
nanigans at his waterfront 
home are liars and saying that 
the Palm Beach Police De-
partment is childish. 
There never was any sex 
between Jeffrey Epstein and 
Epstein 
any underage 
women, his 
lead attorney, 
Jack Gold-
berger, said 
from Idaho 
where he was 
vacationing 
with his fami-
ly. 
Epstein did have young 
women come to his house to 
give him massages, Goldberg-
er said. Mr. Epstein absolute-
ly insisted anybody who came 
to his house be over the age of 
18. How he verified that, I don't 
know. The question is, did 
anything illegal occur. The law 
was not violated here. 
He had no explanation as to 
why Epstein would pay girls or 
women with no massage train-
ing — as the alleged victims 
said was the case — $200 to 
$300 for their visits. The 
credibility of these witnesses 
has been seriously ques-
'Mr. Epstein 
absolutely 
insisted 
anybody 
who came to 
his house be 
over the age 
of 18.' 
JACK GOLDBERGER, 
Epstein's lead attorney 
tioned, Goldberger said. 
Epstein, 53, was indicted 
by a county grand jury last 
month on a charge of felony 
solicitation of prostitution. Af-
ter an 11-month investigation 
that included sifting through 
Epstein's trash and surveilling 
his home, Palm Beach police 
concluded there was enough 
evidence to charge him with 
sexual activity with minors. 
When the grand jury indicted 
Epstein on the less serious 
charge, Police Chief Michael 
Reiter referred the case to the 
FBI to determine whether 
there were federal law viola-
tions. 
After a spate of stories 
about the case last week, New 
York publicist Dan Mores — 
whose client list has included 
Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lopez 
— said on Saturday that Ep-
stein's camp was ready to get , 
their story out.

Attorney: Police gave media 'distorted view' 
EPSTEIN from 1B • 
They did that Monday via Gold-
berger and a Los Angeles publicist 
for Miami criminal defense attorney 
Roy Black, who also has represented 
Epstein in the case. 
We just think there has been a 
distorted view of this case in the me-
dia presented by the Palm Beach po-
lice, Goldberger said. 
Reiter has consistently declined 
to comment on the case and did not 
respond to a request for comment 
Monday. 
The implication that State Attor-
ney Barry Krischer was easy on Ep-
stein by presenting the case to a 
grand jury rather than filing charges 
directly against him is wrong, Gold-
berger said. 
The Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment was happy and ecstatic that 
the panel was going to review the 
evidence. I think what happened is 
they weren't happy with the. result. 
They decided to use the press to 
embarrass Mr. Epstein. 
But records show that Reiter 
wrote Krischer on May 1 — well be-
fore the case went to the grand jury --
suggesting that Krischer consider if 
good and sufficient reason exists to 
require your disqualification from the 
prosecution of these cases. 
Rather than flat-out decline to 
charge Epstein, Krischer referred 
the case to the grand jury to op-
pease the chief, Goldberger said. 
A state attorney's spokesman 
would say only that the office refers 
cases to the grand jury when there 
are issues with the viability of the 
evidence or witnesses' credibility. 
Both the state attorney and the 
grand jury concluded there was not 
sufficient evidence that Epstein had 
sex with minors, according to Gold-
berger. It was just a childish perfor-
mance by the Palm Beach Police 
Department, Goldberger said. 
The defense attorney said one of 
the alleged victims who claimed she 
was a minor was in fact over the age 
of 18. Another alleged victim who 
was subpoenaed to testify to the 
grand jury failed to do so. Epstein's

accusers, he added, have histories of 
drug abuse and thefts. 'These wom-
en are liars. We've established that. 
But why would they all invent 
their stories about meeting Epstein 
for sexual massages? 
I don't have an answer as to what 
was the motivation for these women 
to come forward and make these al-
legations, Goldberger said.
