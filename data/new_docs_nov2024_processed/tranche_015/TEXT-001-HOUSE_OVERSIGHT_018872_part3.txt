series 2 machine and began to go through the copying process. 
Approximately 1/2 through the tape, the tape wrapped around the 
spindle and became locked and stretched the tape. I examined it and 
determined that it was in the best interest to leave it as it is as a 
prior copy had been made and turned over to Sergeant Frick. I 
immediately took the tape to Sergeant Frick and allowed him to examine 
it and then obtained the copy from him and Detective Recarey and 
brought the copy of the tape down and made a copy for him based on 
that. The tape was placed back in the original container and is 
retained in the evidence bag under the previously mentioned property

and announced we had a search warrant. A safety search was done and 
members exited the home. I read the search warrant to Banasiak as Mgr 
Parkinson videotaped the search warrant execution. Several interior 
decorators were located on the property. I spoke with Mark Zeff, of 
in New York. Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for 
Mr. Epstein's homes. He advised he was contacted in March of ?005 to 
do a complete overhaul on the house. He advised he was on the phone 
with Mr. Epstein when officers announced the search warrant. Mr. 
Epstein was then made aware of the search warrant. Mr. Zeff advised, 
his contact with Epstein is strictly business and he has never 
witnessed Epstein with any girls except for his assistants, or

he personally worked on the New York and Palm Beach home for Mr. 
Epstein. He has previously met with_______________________F, Epstein's 
assistants in New York and in Florida. Estes stated they travel with

for only one month. She stated she has never met Epstein and has not 
seen him. The interview was then concluded. 
I then spoke with Douglas Schoettle of____________________in New York 
City. Schoettle stated he has been Epstein's Architect for seven 
years. He further stated he deals with Epstein's assistants and 
speaks with Epstein on the phone. Schoettle stated he mainly speaks

are needed. 
At approximately 10:30 am, I was informed that the videotaping was

cameras. The first camera was a covert wall clock in the garage area. 
I traced the wire behind the clock and removed the RCA wire and 
unplugged the camera. The other covert camera was located within a 
desk clock beside Epstein's desk. I traced the wire behind the clock 
and unplugged the RCA wire. I could not locate another camera. I
