Alessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance 
person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s 
arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they 
traveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing 
with his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with 
Epstein directly. 
I asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr. 
Alessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each 
masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that 
towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and 
younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be 
sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would 
occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled 
that he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or 
in his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a 
massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his 
employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a 
long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made 
after the massage. Alessi was never privy to what went on during the

He was asked if he remembered any names of the girls that massaged 
Epstein. He tried to remember and was unable to provide any exact 
names of any girls. Alessi was asked about any contact with anyone 
from the Epstein organization. Alessi said he did speak with Mr. 
Epstein shortly after my initial contact with him to find out what was 
going on. Alessi also stated that approximately on November 11, 2005, 
he was contacted by a private investigator from the Law Office of Roy 
Black. The investigator had called him to meet with him to ascertain 
what he was going to tell the police. Alessi stated they met at the 
Carrabba s Restaurant in Boynton Beach and discussed the same 
questions I was asking him. I informed Mr. Alessi and Mr. Morrell 
that as this is an ongoing investigation and anything we discuss 
should be confidential. They both acknowledged the fact that the 
information would be kept confidential. It should be noted that a 
court reporter was present during the interviews and would be 
providing a copy of the statements to me when they become available. 
On November 21, 2005, I received a voice mail from Mr. Fronstin who 
advised he would not be making Mr. Epstein available for any 
statements. He did have some words that he wanted to relay on behalf 
of Mr. Epstein. I telephoned his office and left a message for him to 
return my call. 
On November 29, 2005, I received a call back from Mr. Fronstin who 
left a voice mail after hours on November 28, 2005, advising he would 
return my call during normal business hours to speak with me reference

allegedly donated over $100,000 to the Ballet of Florida for massages. 
The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound for him that is 
why he has had many massages. Mr. Fronstin stated he appreciated the 
way the investigation has not been leaked out into the media. I 
explained to Mr. Fronstin that it is as important to protect the 
innocent if the allegations are not substantiated. Mr. Fronstin was 
told of the allegations that the private investigators assigned to the

On 102005 at approx 0930hrs I assisted with the execution of a 
search warrant at 358 El Brillo Ave, Palm Beach. 
Initially I was assigned to enter the residence and conduct a 
sweep of the premises for safety purposes. I then accompanied CSEU 
tech Pavlik while she photographed the exterior of the house. Once 
this was complete I was assigned to search certain areas of the house 
with Det. Dawson as part of the search warrant. 
We began in the garage, searching three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a 
Harley Davidson motorcycle and adjacent closets in the garage. 
Nothing of evidentiary value was located. 
We then searched two closets off the kitchen area on the east 
side. These can best be described as pantry or storage closets. 
Nothing of evidentiary value was obtained. 
A small office with adjoining bath was then searched. In the bath 
area I located a phone message book with recent messages. This item 
was seized as evidence. Please note this bath and shower area are not 
used as designed but are storage areas containing a variety of items 
to include a gun safe in the shower and assorted household items. 
We then searahed a bath area and closet at the base of the main 
stairs in the foyer. Inside the closet two massage tables were 
located as well as partial nude female photographs. These items were 
later seized as evidence. Nothing of evidentiary value was noted in 
the bathroom. 
We then searched two bedrooms upstairs on the east side of the 
residence. Located in the bath room of the south bedroom was penis 
shaped soap. Located in the bedroom of the northern bedroom was penis 
and vagina shaped soap as well as an adult sex toy. These items were 
seized as evidence. 
We then searched the pool cabana located in the south west corner 
of the.property. Several photographs of nude females were seized as 
evidence 
I was then assigned to stand by with a person I believe was 
Douglas Schoettle. Mr. Schoettle was in the residence at the 
beginning of the search warrant. He was present during the warrant 
service and subsequent search. I stood by with him until the search 
was completed and I departed the residence. I had no conversation 
with him regarding the reason for our presence. 
Regarding seized evidence, all items were photographed in place 
and then collected by CSEU personnel. 
This concludes my involvement in this case.

On Thursday, October 20, 2005 at approximately 0936 hours, I assisted 
in the execution of a search warrant located at 358 El Brillo Way, 
Palm Beach, Florida, residence of Jeffrey Epstein. I was instructed 
by Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media 
related material from the residence. 
Upon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as 
the Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the 
left side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware sitting on floor 
next to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or 
features indicating a make or model. This CPU was powered off with 
the power cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the 
CPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor, 
printer, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, I 
observed an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware 
would allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPU shard disk. 
The ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search 
and no external camera was located within this room. 
The CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel 
LCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative 
of a second computer; however, no other computer was found. It 
appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the 
cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same 
area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices, 
i.e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is 
commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media 
was found. 
After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned 
all items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis 
via a property receipt. 
I was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden 
Room, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a 
flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and 
printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed 
from an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk 
area revealed no signs of any media devices. 
Det. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana 
room, which is detached from the residence and located just south of 
the pool. In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office 
type setting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor, 
keyboard, mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the 
cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A 
search of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.

Det. Recarey directed me to a second detached structure located on the 
South East corner of the property. This area of this structure was 
assigned with single letters to identify a particular part of the 
room. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a powered 
on Dell Dimension 2350, attached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The 
screen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with URL 
address of http://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active 
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. The power 
cord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the 
cable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU, 
marked with Serial Number 6WTVN21, was secured and turned over the 
evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt. 
I also located several media related items within Room B, which were 
recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence 
Custodians. 
I then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a 
white in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer 
desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on. 
The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software, 
warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active 
windows in. the Start panel window and photographed screen. I removed 
the power cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdown all other 
media. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was 
secured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic 
analysis via property receipt. I also located several media related 
items within Room F, which were recorded onto a property receipt and 
turned over the Evidence Custodians. 
This concluded my participation in the search of the residence.

During a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed 
by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months. He was referred by 
associates and his employment lasted the months of November 2004 
through May 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included 
being the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr. 
Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. Rodriguez advised he had 
very limited contact with Mr. Epstein. If Rodriguez needed to relay a 
message to Mr. Epstein, he would have to notify Epstein's secretary 
Leslie in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal 
assistant, who would relay the message to Epstein. Rodriguez 
stated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in 
residence. 
I asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in 
Palm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked 
specifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he 
would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the 
morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. 
Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them 
comfortable until either or Epstein would meet with them. 
Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them 
entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat. 
They would then be encountered by either or Epstein. They 
would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if 
any of the masseuses appeared young in age. He advised he didn't ask 
their ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate 
like his own daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they 
would eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time.. Rodriguez 
stated the girls that would come appeared to.be too young to be 
masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered 
a dozen roses to____________________________________ for one of the girls 
that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high 
school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the 
massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and 
would discover massager/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor. 
He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put 
them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood 
armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed. 
Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a 
car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive 
her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl 
always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself 
as a human ATM machine and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a 
minimum balance of $2,000 dollars on him at all times. When a girl 
would come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or 
was not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl 
(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify 
Epstein the amount they were given. Epstein also ordered Rodriguez to

needed to explain either to Mr. Epstein or his assistants what was 
done at the house or who visited the house as he stated he was 
in-charge of Mr. Epstein's personal security while in Palm Beach. I
