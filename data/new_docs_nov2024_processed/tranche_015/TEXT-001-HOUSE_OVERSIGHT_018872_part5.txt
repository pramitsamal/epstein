A Grand Jury Session was requested during the month of February 2006, 
in which all the girls that had been interviewed would have been 
called to testify before the Grand Jury to seek an indictment against 
Jeffrey Epstein. Due to subsequent meetings with the State Attorney's 
Office and Defense Attorney Alan Dershowitz the Grand Jury was 
postponed until a later time. Dershowitz had provided a package of 
material on the main victims in this case in which they appear on 
myspace.com and speak about alcohol use and some marijuana use. The 
State Attorney's Office wanted time to review the material. 
I requested additional subpoenas from the State Attorney's Office in 
which I requested information from Dollar Rent a Car and Jet Aviation. 
The information requested from Dollar Rent a Car was for the rented 
vehicle by Alfredo Rodriguez while under the employ of Epstein for one 
of the victims. The other subpoena requested was for Jet Aviation for 
dates and times when Epstein's planes were in Palm Beach County. 
I continued to research other names that were acquired either from 
interviews or intelligence gathered during the investigation. I

who approached her during this encounter. I loriginally was reluctant 
to provide the name of the person who approached her to offer her not

subpoenas were delivered to the witnesses and they would be calling 
for arrangements for the date and time needed for the Grand Jury. I 
spoke with ASA Weiss and informed her of the possible intimidation by 
the defense. 
On April 13, and April 14, 2006 I attempted contact on several 
occasions with ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic to ascertain when the 
victims needed to report for Grand Jury testimony. Messages were left 
on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the hours of 9:00 am

for either of them to return my call as I had not heard from the State 
Attorney's Office as to the time and date of the Grand Jury.

jury as they would accept this deal. Belohlavic stated a probable 
cause would be needed to book Epstein in the county jail and would let 
me know as to when it would be needed. I explained my disapproval of 
the deal and not being consulted prior to the deal being offered. 
However I expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval 
would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief 
Reiter call Barry Krisher about the deal. I left the area and 
returned to the police station where I briefed the Chief about the 
deal offered. 
I checked my voice mail messa es and discovered a message from

Attorney's Office still had not returned any of her calls as to when 
they are needed for this case. I then called ASA Belohlavic's office

explained to them what the State Attorney's Office had done.

Investigator Tim Valentine called to officially notify me of the 
cancellation of the Grand Jury. He requested I contact the victims 
that had been served to appear, to notify them of the cancellation. I 
advised Valentine that as this Grand Jury session was called based on 
the State Attorney's Office decision to have the victims heard by the 
Grand Jury that I felt it was the States Attorney's Office 
responsibility to contact the victims and advise them of the reason 
they were no longer needed.

On May 10, 2006, information was received that Epstein's associate, 
Leslie Wexner, The Limited Inc, CEO's, plane had arrived in West Palm 
Beach, PBIA. The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N9OOLS registration, 
was on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently 
acquired the services of a new attorney, and the fact that Epstein's 
house is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may 
be in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence, 
358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting 
remodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed 
driving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida 
registration of F30QQF. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north 
on County Road. Det Caristo and I conducted surveillance on Norr. 
Norr traveled to several construction sites and checked on certain 
jobs. Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det Caristo and I 
traveled to Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue 
stripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was 
visible on the bottom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane. 
We maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a 
caravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed 
several people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of 
the executive team for Limited Inc. The executives were in Palm Beach 
County for an executive meeting for the day. They arrived in Palm • 
Beach County on May 9, 2006 at 9:30 pm and were scheduled to leave on 
the 10th at 5:00 pm. 
On May 12, 2006, I met with ASA Lana Belohlavek at the State 
Attorney's Office. She explained that her boss, Barry Krischer, was 
requesting this case be taken to the Grand Jury again. I explained to 
her I had requested arrest warrants for Jeffrey Epstein, _________________ 
and 1 1. I asked that she either issue the warrants or 
direct file, as so much time has elapsed since the original request to 
the Grand Jury. I explained that the Palm Beach Police Department had 
concluded the case in December of 2005 and has been waiting for the 
case to go forward. Belohlavek stated the original Offer was again 
offered to the new defense attorney. She was waiting for their answer 
by Friday May 19, 2006. She stated she would advise me of the answer.

In addition to the home in Palm Beach, Epstein also 
maintains a residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands, New York and 
New Mexico. 
To date, the PBCRA continues, to develop witnesses and 
victims from across the United States. Due to the media coverage, 
unknown status of the state investigation, vulnerability of the 
young female victims, and political influences, the AUSAs and 
Case Agents have a target date of January 2007 for indictment. 
Based on the ongoing criminal investigation, the PBCRA 
is requesting the assistance in establishing Epstein's criminal 
activity utilizing interstate commerce and the travel in 
interstate commerce to engage in illicit sexual conduct and 
prostitution. Prior to conducting captioned leads, it is  
requested that the lead agent(s) contact SA 
FBI Miami, West Palm RA, 1 1 or SA___________
