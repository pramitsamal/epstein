BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Before Wednesday of this week, you had none
of the information that you just described about
Professor Dershowitz's testimony, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. I'm trying to look at my notes here of your
long answer, but one thing you indicated that -- was the
fact that Professor Dershowitz gave long answers is
somehow indicative of false answers or perjury --

MR. SCAROLA: That is --

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. -- is that right?

MR. SCAROLA: That is an absolute
mischaracterization of the statement that
Professor Cassell made. He did not refer to the
length of the answers, but rather their
nonresponsiveness.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Let me -- let me ask a different question.
Go back to the flight logs themselves.

A. Okay.

Q. My initial question that got us going down
this line was: Isn't it true that the flight logs

themselves support Professor Dershowitz's testimony that

he was never on a plane with Virginia Roberts, the face

of the flight logs support that proposition?

A. The face of the flight logs for the relevant
period of time, we can call it the hot period of time or
whatever you want, did not reveal the presence of
Mr. Dershowitz on those flights, yes.

Q. Okay. So during the period -- well,
actually, there's no flight log that shows Virginia
Roberts and Professor Dershowitz on the same airplane,

correct?
A. That's my understanding, yes.
QQ. And --

MR. SCAROLA: By name. You're -- you're --

MS. McCAWLEY: And it -~

MR. SCAROLA: -- asking whether she was there
identified by name?

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. To your knowledge, isn't it correct that
there is no flight log that's been produced in this case
by any party that reflects Professor Dershowitz and
Virginia Roberts on the same plane, as you read the
flight log?

MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry. Are you asking
whether those same names appear on the flight log
together?

MR. SIMPSON: My question, I think, is

perfectly clear.
BY MR, SIMPSON:

Q. My question, Mr. Cassell, is: You reviewed
the flight logs, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You reviewed them in some detail, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Is there any entry on those flight lines --
logs that you read as putting Professor Dershowitz and
Miss Roberts on the same plane?

A. No.

Q. And so your testimony about questions about
the completeness and accuracy of those flight logs goes
to whether the logs are -- let me rephrase that.

The answer that you gave about your question
as -- your views as to the completeness of the flight
logs and whether they may have been changed in some
ways, goes to whether those logs are conclusive, not
whether they, in fact, support Professor Dershowitz's
testimony that he was not on a plane with Virginia
Roberts?

MR. SCAROLA: I'm going to object to the form
of the question as vague and ambiguous. I don't
understand it.

THE WITNESS: And I won't give a long answer,

ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(8954) 331-4400

but I -- I think, as I previously indicated, you
can't just look at the face of these documents
without -- with -- you know, against the context
of an international sex trafficking ring that's
trying to cover up what it's doing. You can't
just look and documents and assume that they are
100 percent accurate without that -- having that
context in mind.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Andso am I right, that on the face of the
flight logs, there's nothing showing Virginia Roberts
and Professor Dershowitz on the same plane?

A. That's correct.

Q. And -- goon.

And so doI understand correctly that your
position is that the flight logs may not be complete or
may have been changed, but you do not dispute, that on
their face, they support Professor Dershowitz's
testimony?

MR. SCAROLA: Objection.

MS. McCAWLEY: Objection.

MR. SCAROLA: Compound.

THE WITNESS: Could you just aggregate that?
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. You follow the objections very well.
