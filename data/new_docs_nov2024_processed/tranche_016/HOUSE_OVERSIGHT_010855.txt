Q. Let me --
A. Iwasn't --
Q. Let me --

A.  -- following their answer.

Q. Let me -- let me just ask a different
question,

A. Sure. Thanks.

Q. You testified that you have -- at some
length, about why you question the accuracy of the
flight logs, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. But I may be redundant, but you don't
question that what they show on their face supports
Professor Dershowitz's testimony --

MS. McCAWLEY: Objection.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q.__-- that he was not on a plane with Virginia
Roberts?

A. The -- you know, the -- the sex trafficking
ring run by Jeffrey Epstein has produced Epstein flight
logs that appear to show that -- that Dershowitz and
Virginia Roberts are not on the plane, so...

Q. So the answer to my question is, yes?

MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry.
THE WITNESS: Which question now?
MR. SIMPSON: The question you just -- could
you read back my -- my question and the answer?
BY MR, SIMPSON:
Q. Let me ask it again.
. Okay.
» That's fine.
I mean, I thought I was --
MR. SCAROLA: There's no question pending.
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.
BY MR. SIMPSON:
Q. What were you about to say?

A. Iwas about to say that the records that they

produced ~-- I'm -- I'm sorry...

Q. The records -- the records that were
produced --

A. On-- on their face, I cannot give youa
flight log that has Virginia Roberts and Alan Dershowitz
sitting next to each other, yes.

Q. And you also -- you also testified a moment
ago that Professor Dershowitz in his testimony in the
last couple of days, had testified that Virginia Roberts
had been arrested for stealing cash; do you refer -- do
you recall that?

A. LIrecall his testimony to that effect, yes.

Q. And you testified that no support for that
had been produced in discovery; is that correct?

A. That's my understanding, yes.

Q. Isn't it true that in Mr. Alessi's
deposition, he describes that under oath and says that
it happened?

A. Idon't have a recollection of criminal
charges having been discussed in the Alessi deposition.

Q. Is it -- well, let me -- let me ask you: Is
it your testimony that you understood that, in fact,

Miss Roberts had been accused of stealing money from her
employer?

MS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to the
extent it gets into any conversations that you
had with Virginia on any of these issues.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm trying to -- if your
question is about the Alessi depo, I don't --
don't immediately recall him discussing -~-
discussing them.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. If lrepresent to you that Mr. Alessi, in his
deposition, referred to a police report and an arrest of
Miss Roberts, do you have any reason to question that?

MR, SCAROLA: Could we -- could we pull out

the deposition? And if you have got a reference
in the deposition, let's take a look at it.

MR, SIMPSON: I'm just asking for his
recollection right now. The document will speak
for itself. But I want to --

MR. SCAROLA: Yes, it will.

MR. SIMPSON: He -- he made a very serious
accusation. I would like to get an answer to my
question. Does he recall whether, in that
deposition that all the parties in this case
have, Mr. Alessi said under oath, that she had
been arrested and charged with stealing from her
employer.

THE WITNESS: When you -- the question built
in a serious accusation, the -- the -- the -- the
statement I was making is that we had propounded
an interrogatory to Mr. Dershowitz saying:

What's the basis for your assertion that

Miss Roberts had a criminal record? And that
answer didn't refer to an Alessi depo. If it --
this is one of the problems that I'm having.

When -- when -- you know, when you come into
a deposition, both sides are supposed to turn
everything over, And then if I get a question
about, well, what if -~ you know, we're relying
