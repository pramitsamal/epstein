Yes,

In all four, you met with the clients?

in three of the four,

And were those three the three in which you
were counsel of record?

A. Yes.

Q. As of December --

A. I believe I was counsel of record on all
three of those. I would have to double-check. I know I
was counsel of record in the federal case. The two of
them are state cases, I believe, that it was pro hac in
the state cases,

Q. Okay. I won't ask you the names, but in the
four cases, what are the initials of your clients?

A. Okay. So the -- the --

Q. Put it this way: How are they identified in

the caption that you filed?

A. Well, also the three that were filed, one
was ~~ one was the initials S.R. I referred to
Miss S.R. yesterday. That was the Jane Doe case in
Federal Court in front of Judge Marra.

There were two state claims. I'll -- I'll

identify the clients as E.W. and L.M.

Q. And then the fourth one?

A. The fourth one, I believe -- the initial M.

and I believe the last initial was B., but I may be
wrong about the B. First initial M.

Q. At the -- okay. At the time that you filed
the joinder motion --

A. Yes,

Q.  -- in the federal case, so December 30th of
2014, you knew that naming Prince Andrew would generate
substantial publicity, correct?

A. I knew it would attract a lot of attention.
Yeah, I mean, “substantial” we could debate, but, sure,
I knew that that was going to -- you know, once you
start exposing the extent of this criminal activity,
obviously, there were going to be a lot of people
interested, yes.

Q. And you also knew that naming Professor
Dershowitz would attract publicity?

A. Well, when you say naming, one of the
things you've got to understand is the names were
already in the case, both Prince Andrew and Alan
Dershowitz. We had pending discovery requests for
information about both of them. So when you say naming
them,” you know, they were already named in the case.

Now, would the additional allegations have
attracted additional attention? Sure.

Q. Mr. Cassell, it's true, is it not, that the

filing on December 30th of 2014, was the first time that
you had ever, yes, ever on behalf of Virginia Roberts or
any other client, accused Professor Dershowitz or
Prince Andrew of sexual abuse in a public filing?

A. If you're talking about direct allegation,
that’s correct.

Q. Had you ever public -- well, at no other time
that -- you expected when you filed the pleading on
December 30th, 2014, that it would be -- be something of
public record that would generate publicity, correct?

A. Public record, the focus was not generating
publicity. Of course, when you file an allegation like
that, there certainly would have been -- we would
anticipate there would have been publicity, absolutely.

Q. And before December 30th of 2014, to the best
of your knowledge, neither you, nor anyone else, had
told Professor Dershowitz that there were allegations
that he personally had engaged in sexual misconduct?

A. um...

MS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to that
date if that reveals anything that would be
privileged between something that would have been
communicated by the client.

MR. SIMPSON: No. These are communications
to Professor Dershowitz.

MR. SCAROLA: Yes. And that could very well
include attorney/client privileged
communications.

MR. SIMPSON: Let me -- I'll ask my question.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. My question is: Did you ever advise
Professor Dershowitz that there were allegations that he
had engaged, himself, in sexual misconduct with minors?

A. Not me personally, no.

Q. Are you aware of any e-mail, letter, other
communication from anybody that went to Professor
Dershowitz that told Professor Dershowitz that he had
been accused of engaging in misconduct himself?

A. Well, there -- I mean, I'm aware that there
was a deposition request in 2009. There was a
deposition request in 2011. That was accompanied by an
exchange of correspondence that said, for example,
numerous witnesses have placed you in the presence of
Jeffrey Epstein and underaged girls. It didn't then go
on to say, and you were committing sexual abuse of them,
but it said numerous witnesses had -- had done that.

And I think a reasonable inference would be
that, you know, you're verily sure that a witness and
then that also raises the possibility of -- well, I
mean, I think Professor Dershowitz mentioned yesterday,
