Of course, we would want to explain that there were nine

separate reasons why those allegations were included. Judge

joinder motion mean? Did you file under Rule 15? It should

have been under Rule 21. What did the judge do?

It has no bearing at all on the issues in the case,

because it leads to a confusion of the jury. The jury's trying
to figure out, well, what's going on in the Crime Victims
