MS. McCAWLEY: Whether she knew about it. That's not

for the truth of the matter, your Honor. That's what she knew

at the time, right, she made the statement, did she know about

all these individuals in the police report, did she know about

this. So that can be offered not for the truth but to show

whether she knew about it. Whether she knew that at the time

she was making that statement, it was false, because not only
did my client get abused there but so many other girls as well.

So, your Honor, that's part of it. And in your order,
in your June 20th order, you said --

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MS. McCAWLEY: Sure:

COURT: You say the detective authenticated these

documents. He didn't authenticate them in the sense of saying

that these are part of the file. I mean, it's not that kind of

an authentication.

MS. McCAWLEY: It is, your Honor. There are two

different things, and I'm jumping around a little bit, so

that's my fault. I'm sorry. But there are a series of
questions -- and I believe it's in our brief but it's also in
our designations where we walked through with him how he

conducted the investigation, how he recorded the information of

these witnesses, the interviews of the witnesses, the fact that

they were reported in this document, etc., in his testimony.

So that's one piece. And that's why this could come in under
