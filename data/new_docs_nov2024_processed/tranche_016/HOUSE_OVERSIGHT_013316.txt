Edwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment
Page 13 of 15

arguments advanced in support of his Motion for Summary Judgment. Under the well-established “sword
and shield” doctrine, Epstein could not seek damages from Edwards while at the same time asserting a
Fifth Amendment privilege to block relevant discovery. See Exhs. B at 14-21, C at 18-25, G at 53:6-24;
78:16-24; 87:20-88:14. The same policies which underlie the sword and shield doctrine as applied to the
recovery of affirmative relief should also apply to attempts to advance positions with respect to a Motion
for Summary Judgment which would have the effect of securing relief against certain claims.

“[T]he law is well settled that a plaintiff is not entitled to both his silence and his lawsuit.” Boys
& Girls Clubs of Marion County, Inc. v. J.A., 22 So. 3d 855, 856 (Fla. Sth DCA 2009)(Griffin, J.,
concurring specially). Thus, “a person may not seek affirmative relief in a civil action and then invoke the
fifth amendment to avoid giving discovery, using the fifth amendment as both a ‘sword and a shield.”
DePalma v. DePalma, 538 So. 2d 1290, 1290 (Fla. 4th DCA 1989)(quoting DeLisi v. Bankers Insurance
Co., 436 So. 2d 1099 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983)). Put another way, “[a] civil litigant’s fifth amendment right to
avoid self-incrimination may be used as a shield but not a sword. This means that a plaintiff seeking
affirmative relief in a civil action may not invoke the fifth amendment and refuse to comply with the
defendant’s discovery requests, thereby thwarting the defendant’s defenses.” Rollins Burdick Hunter of
New York, Inc. v. Euroclassic Limited, Inc., 502 So. 2d 959 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983).. For the same reasons,
Epstein should be precluded from advancing arguments based on purported statements of undisputed fact
which cannot be effectively challenged in light of his assertion of the Fifth Amendment. Epstein has
done precisely what well-established law prohibits.

Conclusion
Based upon the foregoing, the Defendant, Counter-Plaintiff, Bradley Edwards respectfully

submits that Jeffrey Epstein’s Motion for Summary Judgment must be denied.
