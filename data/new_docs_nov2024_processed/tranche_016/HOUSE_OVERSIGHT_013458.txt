Classics Footnote from Israel and A
Separation from Iran. From the other
side of the world both governments
monitored their directors as the Sony
boys kept the peace.

Michael and Tom Bernard invited me
to the Independent Spirit Awards at the
Santa Monica Pier. Michael hosted his
Take Shelter nominees Jessica Chastain,

Olivia Wilde

Michael Shannon and director Jeff
Nichols. Tom held court at the next
table with the entire Iranian cast of A
Separation, which won. Tom almost had
a heart attack when I threw my arms
around Iranian director Asghar Farhadi,
which in Iran is unacceptable behavior,
especially by a Jewish American Princess.
Tom wished I had gone to the crowded
champagne brunch in honor of Prince
Albert and Princess Charlene at the Bel-
Air Hotel where Montblanc launched
Grace Kelly watches. Simultaneously,
TV producer Gary Pudney hosted
another secretive, lunch which Albert
and Charlene actually attended with
Graydon Carter, Carolina Herrera,
Wallace Annenberg, Bobby Shriver,
Bobby Marx, Kathy and Ricky Hilton
and Lynn Wyatt. Wolfgang Puck
joined them for dessert.

“The French, as the The
Artist gang was nicknamed, had
won six Césars, France’s version
of the Oscars, in Paris the night
before. They flew all night and

| Harvey’s chauffeur arranged a

| police escort from LAX just in
time for them to win four Spirit
Awards, cementing the Oscar
win.

Back at the BHH, Spielberg
was the first to arrive at the
tenth “Night Before”
fundraiser in support of the
Motion Picture and Television
Fund. Jeffrey Katzenberg had
already secured $200 of a $350
million fundraising goal that
included money from him,

Tom Cruise, Steve Bing,
Casey Wasserman, Clooney
and Spielberg. Every nominee
showed up.
Chanel and Charles Finch
cooked up their chic soiree at
Madeo, where a mariachi band

annual

enthusiastically announced
everyones arrival. Bedecked
exclusively in Chanel were Diane

Kruger, Elizabeth Olsen, Rose Byrne,
Ginnifer Goodwin and Rachel Bilson.
Also air kissing were Rachel Zoe,
Rosanna Arquette, Alice Evans and
Ioan Gruffudd, Zachary Quinto, Julia
Ormond and Dustin Hoffman.

My Week With Marilyn’s English
director Simon Curtis insisted we join
Kenneth Branagh at The Weinstein

Company’s bash at the Soho House in
time to hear Tony Bennett sing “Autumn
Leaves” to Harvey’s surprised 86-year-
old mother Miriam, Madonna and
Meryl. Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo,
Michel Hazanavicius and _ producer
Thomas Langmann staggered around
completely jet lagged, too tired to speak
English. Uggie on the other hand was
the absolute star of the evening as his
trainer placed him in everyone's arms
for photos. WE’s Andrea Riseborough
and Abbie Cornish sat next to baseball
cap-clad Leonardo DiCaprio as his ex,
Bar Refaeli, kept her distance across
the room. Zoe Saldana walked in
holding hands with Bradley Cooper.
Scarlett Johansson introduced me to
her boyfriend Nate Naylor. Katy Perry,
Felicity Jones and Malin Akerman
circled a refreshed Gerard Butler. The
two daughters of New York slain hero cop
Peter Figoski, Corrine, 14 and Caroline,
16 who had also been Harvey’s guests at
the Super Bowl stood in the middle of
this circus and just fainted.

SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 26

I met interior designer Nicky Haslam
in the Polo Lounge and found Nancy
Reagan brunching with Bob Colacello
and Carolina Herrera. Nancy knows me
as “The DVD Lady”. I promised to send
her The Iron Lady. I didn’t have the heart
to tell her that her late husband, who was
Margaret Thatcher's best friend, was
barely mentioned in the film.

In a Marchesa gown, Dennis Basso
fur and Iradj Moini necklace, I collected
Simon Curtis and headed to the
Hollywood & Highland Center. Simon,
who has never been to the Oscars before,
miraculously scored a front row seat
between Michelle Williams and Clooney.
We pulled up to screams of hysteria at the
mother of all red carpets.

Meryl’s publicist Dart
whispered to me. “She is dressed like
an Oscar. What do we do if she loses?”
Sacha Baron Cohen hilariously guilted
the Academy into letting him wear his
costume from The Dictator and, after
soiling Ryan Seacrest, he went directly
to dinner at Vanity Fair. Gwyneth
Paltrow won the style award in Tom
Ford’s white column and Angelina Jolie
so successfully invented a new one legged
pose in a thigh high slit gown on the red
carpet she repeated it for 39.3 million
