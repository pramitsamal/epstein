people onstage.

Tickets were so tight that I gave my plus
one to Penelope Ann Miller because she
promoted The Artist every day for four
months. Seated next to us were co-stars
James Cromwell and Missi Pyle.

Billy Crystal made us laugh, Cirque de
Soleil made us gasp and most of the wins
were expected.

Colin Firth crowned Mery] her third
win on a record 17 nominations and
Harvey beamed.

The Academy was so confident The
Artist would win, they invited Uggie,
who waited in the wings and ran out as
Tom Cruise announced the film.

Once the show was off the air, I followed
my seatmates to the stage loaded with
their programs, wraps and handbags and
led the French to the press rooms.

The Governor’s Ball was the next
stop where the winners got their Oscars
engraved. Everyone paid respects to
the Academy’s Tom Sherak and Dawn
Hudson. Stars headed to the Sunset Tower
to Graydon’ glittering Vanity Fair Oscar
bash and their militarized security with
micro chipped cards. If your name was
not on the list and you were carrying an
Oscar, you could walk in. Billy and Janice
Crystal were mobbed with well wishers.
Elton John made $5 million dollars at his
20th AmFar event which also auctioned
off two tickets to Vanity Fair's party for
$230,000.Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes
were thrilled to talk to George Lucas.
Gwyneth snuggled with Coldplay’s Chris
Martin and Jennifer Lopez brought boy
toy Casper Smart. Every major actor
previously mentioned is standing in the
room. Spotted in a sea of celebrity were

exclusive after party at Craig’s in West
Hollywood for close friends Bryan
Lourd, Grant Heslov, Stan Rosenfield,
Brad and Angelina, Emily Blunt and
John Krasinski, Cindy Crawford,
Jimmy Kimmel, Ryan Seacrest and best
adapted screenplay winner Alexander
Payne.

George and Brad cancelled each
other out with two great performances.
Clooney immediately returned to his best
role as humanitarian, flew to the Sudan,
met with Obama and was dramatically
arrested at a protest.

“The French”? threw a_ wild
celebration at the Chateau
Marmont, poured champagne
down their throats and threw
each other in the pool at 3:00
a.m. Nobody spoke English.

By 4:00 Harvey
rounded up his artists for a
live broadcast on The Today
Show from The Four Seasons
lobby. In disheveled black tie,
five Oscar winners, all total
unknowns a year ago, made Oscar
history with the first silent film to
win since 1927.

God, but 5,800
Academy voters who said they
won. This had to be the most
exciting night of their lives. The
glory and memories live forever.
The next day they went back
to reality . As Woody says, “A
statue does not really change y
your life. You stillgetacold”

Uggie was invited
to the White
correspondent’s dinner as
a guest of the Washington
Times in April. He hopes to
meet President Obama. +
