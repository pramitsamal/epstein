(Mandell and Russo, 1981; Knapp and Mandell, 1983; Russo and Mandell, 1984a;
Russo and Mandell, 1986). Similar bifurcating and power law kinetics were found in
receptor-ligand binding systems (Mandell, 1984) which were confirmed by more
recent studies of diffusion-limited binding kinetics with receptors immobilized on a
biosensor surface (Sadana, 1998). Hierarchical kinetics have also been reported in
time courses of drug and metabolite levels (Koch and Zajcek, 1991), tissue tracer
washout studies (Beard and Bassingthwaighte, 1998), carrier mediated transport
processes (Ogihara et al, 1998), general pharmacokinetic functions (Macheras et al,
1996) and biochemical networks (Yates, 1992). It is likely that bifurcating and
hierarchical, power law kinetic functions will be studied more commonly in the
chemical literature in general (Shlesinger and Zaslavsky, 1996; Berlin et al, 1996)
as well as applied to a variety of protein-mediated biological functions (Dewey,
1997).

The first demonstration of and stochastic model for nonconvergent
distributions of interspike intervals of a single neuron was by Gerstein and
Mandelbrot (1964). Though rich with possibilities, it has been only very recently that
additional work from this point of view has been published. This is likely due to the
fact that most neuroscience oriented statistical packages, with rare exceptions, are
without techniques for computing descriptive parameters for these divergent
probability density distributions. This has not been the case for economic time
series, download STABLE from http:///www.cas.american.edu/~jpnolan. Recently,
applications of the Fano and Allan factor as well as power spectral scaling
exponents to observed and shuffled series of spike counts and interspike intervals
in the auditory and visual systems (including spatial and/or time resolved single unit
recordings in retinal ganglion, lateral geniculate and lateral superior olivary cells as
well a auditory nerve fibers) demonstrate the characteristic behavior of
nonconvergent, hierarchical stochastic systems (Teich, 1989; Teich et al, 1990;
Lowen and Teich, 1992; Kumar and Johnson, 1993; Kelly et al, 1996; Teich et al,
1997). These statistical techniques are well suited to the characterization of the

irregularly intermittent bursting patterns generic for activity in single neurons as well
