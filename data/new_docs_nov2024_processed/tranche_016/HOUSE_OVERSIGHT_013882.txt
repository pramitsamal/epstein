The #1 Fear: ‘Sweetheart, Did You Buy
a Porsche in China?”

L., sure you might have your fears. AJ certainly did:

My outsourcers now know an alarming amount about me—not just my schedule but my cholesterol, my
infertility problems, my Social Security number, my passwords (including the one that is a particularly
adolescent curse word). Sometimes I worry that I can’t piss off my outsourcers or [ll end up with a
$12,000 charge on my MasterCard bill from the Louis Vuitton in Anantapur.

The good news is that misuse of financial and confidential information is rare. In all of the interviews I
conducted for this section, I could find only one case of information abuse, and I had to search long and
hard. It involved an overworked U.S.-based VA who hired freelance help at the last moment.

Commit to memory the following—never use the new hire. Prohibit small-operation VAs from
subcontracting work to untested freelancers without your written permission. The more established and
higher-end firms, Brickwork in the below example, have security measures that border on excessive and
make it simple to pinpoint abusers in the case of a breach:

e» Employees undergo background checks and sign NDAs
(nondisclosure agreements) in accordance with the company
policy of maintaining confidentiality of client information

e » Electronic access card for entry and exit

e » Credit card information keyed only by select supervisors

e » Removal of paper from the offices is prohibited

e » VLAN-based access restrictions between different teams; this
ensures that there is no unauthorized access of information

between people of different teams in the organization

e » Regular reporting on printer logs
