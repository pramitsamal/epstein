Today we add a CNH put (expressed as a USD/CNH call at 7.6 strike) partly because it
fits with our positive USD call but also because it is a potential hedge against the trade
rhetoric of the new administration descending into something more meaningful. Given
the stated intent to declare the Chinese as currency manipulators and the concern that
our currency strategists already have about the amount of reserves the Chinese hold, it
is not impossible to imagine a much weaker CNY/CNH should the Chinese authorities
allow a free float. We see this as a sensible hedge against our long EM equity position.

We have two other standalone currency trades, short EUR/SEK and long RUB/ZAR. The
former has dropped as the EUR has weakened against the USD. We continue to think
that the Swedish economy is more robust than the Eurozone and that the Riksbank will
sooner or later have to adjust monetary policy accordingly. We see a lot more room for
this pair to move in 2017, particularly if there are political concerns ahead of the French
presidential elections as these will likely weigh on the EUR.
RUB/ZAR has been quite erratic since we re-established the trade, reflecting both
volatility in the oil price and developments in South African politics. The latest no
confidence vote against President Zuma underlines how tricky South African politics are
at the moment. Concerns will remain on the economic progress of the country until the
political situation becomes clearer. In the meantime we expect a higher risk premium to
be associated with the currency.
