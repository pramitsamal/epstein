European equities: switch to outright long Healthcare

We switch our European sector pair trade preferring Healthcare over Food & Beverage
into an outright long in Healthcare. Both sectors have suffered versus the market from
the rotation out of defensives and bond proxies. That has reduced the valuation of the
Food & Beverage sector to less extreme levels. Meanwhile Healthcare looks very
attractively valued and we see compelling risk reward in the sector on an outright basis
at current levels.

The fundamental bull case for Health rests on the strong pipeline of new products for
the big cap pharma universe. Our sector analysts forecast EU Pharma to deliver a 2018-
21E EPS CAGR of 11%, up from mid-single digit levels in recent years. Historically that
would justify a PE re-rating and a multiple for the pharma sub-sector nearer 17-18x
than the current 13x 2018 PE.

We believe the Republican clean sweep in the US elections represents a positive
catalyst as it significantly decreases the potential for legislative initiatives to
aggressively control drug pricing in the US. The catalyst for the sector to re-rate will
come progressively from newsflow around new products. The next 12 months should
see progress on this front with several of the European large caps expected to announce
key data on important drugs in 2017.
