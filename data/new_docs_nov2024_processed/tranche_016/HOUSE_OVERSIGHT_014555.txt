Exhibit 21: Historical Total Returns vs. ISG’s 2013 Outlook 5-Year Prospective Total Returns
Our 5-year return forecasts have so far been relatively accurate for the bulk of assets in our diversified model portfolio, but

we have not been right across the board.

have also been relatively accurate for the bulk

of assets in our diversified model portfolio. In
Exhibit 21, we compare the five-year annualized
expected total returns published in our 2013
Outlook to what transpired over the last four
years. Our forecasts for 1) fixed income returns
including both investment grade and high yield,

2) hedge fund returns, and 3) EAFE equity returns
were close to the mark. Directionally, we were

also right about US equity returns but off in terms
of magnitude. We were also struck by how close
our US bank sector return forecasts were to the
realized returns—approximately a quarter of which
were realized after the November election. This
observation has reinforced our belief in one of the
pillars of our investment philosophy: having the
appropriate horizon for various strategies is critical
to long-term success.

Not surprisingly, we have not been right
across the board. We underestimated Japanese
equity returns by 11.4 percentage points on an
annualized basis and we overestimated emerging
market equity and emerging market local debt
returns, by sizable 13.5 and 12.1 percentage
points, respectively, on an annualized basis.
Japanese equities realized an annualized 18%
return and EM equity and local debt realized
negative returns, at -2% and -5% annualized,
respectively. While our forecasts were off
the mark, our emerging market investment
recommendations were on the mark. In mid-2013,

we recommended clients reduce their strategic
allocation to emerging market assets. Even though
we had forecast expected returns that were

nearly double those of US equities, we became
