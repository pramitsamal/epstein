SECTION II

2017 Global
Economic Outlook:
Winds of Change

FOR MOST OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, GLOBAL POLICY MAKERS
have been buffeted by the gale force headwinds generated by
the financial crisis. In response, central banks around the world
have expanded their balance sheets by a staggering $12.5
trillion,”” while fiscal austerity measures in the G-7 economies
have reduced the general government budget deficit from 10%
of GDP to just 3.6% today.

Although this mix of policies may have helped avoid a
second Great Depression, it has fallen short of fostering a
robust economic recovery. According to the IME, the nominal
GDP of advanced economies has grown at just a 1.6%
annualized pace in US dollar terms since its 2009 trough,
making it among the slowest expansions on record. The
overt reliance on monetary policy has also had unintended
consequences. Persistently low interest rates have crippled
bank profitability and penalized savers. Moreover, the boost
that low rates provide to stock prices primarily benefited a
narrow segment of the income distribution, exacerbating
inequality concerns. Not surprisingly, populism has been on
the rise globally.
