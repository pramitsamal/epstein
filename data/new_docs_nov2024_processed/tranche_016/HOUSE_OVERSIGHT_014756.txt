LatAm: short BRL/MXN

Our top contrarian trade in Latin American markets is selling BRL/MXN (spot 6.00,
target 5.00, stop 6.75). The trade benefits from valuation, positioning and our views of
the expected effects of the US election on the Brazilian and Mexican economies.

MXN 10% undervalued, BRL 5% overvalued

We estimate the Mexican peso is about 10% undervalued while the Brazilian real is
about 5% overvalued, based on our Compass valuation model. The model provides
estimates of long-run equilibrium trade-weighted exchange rates consistent with the
convergence of current account balances toward levels that are in line with country
fundamentals that determine savings and investments.

Mexico’s real exchange rate index is at its lowest since at least 1999, and about 35%
cheaper than its long-run average. Brazil’s real exchange rate has risen sharply in 2016
and is now around 8% stronger than its long-run average (Chart 48).

LatAm under Trump’s world

We believe the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the US will be
negative to Latin American economies. His economic plan will likely involve a significant
fiscal expansion, perhaps tighter monetary policy and some protectionist’s measures.
These will likely lead to higher US rates and a strengthening of the US dollar. Higher
international interest rates are a negative shock for emerging economies and any
acceleration in US economic growth will be skewed to domestic nontraded goods.

We think Brazil’s economy will likely be more negatively affected since its strategy to
gradually reduce budget deficits is based on low global rates, capital inflows and higher
domestic growth.

Mexico, on the other hand, may benefit on relative terms from a construction and
infrastructure boom in the US. Any revival in US manufacturing would also be good for
Mexico, particularly if Trump’s protectionist measures are not as substantial as feared.

Market is not positioned for a MXN rally and BRL selloff

Selling BRL/MXN is a contrarian trade. Foreign investors are significantly long BRL
according to our positioning index based on BM&F data. Market positioning by local
investors is even more stretched toward long BRL. On the contrary, speculative
investors are short MXN according our positioning index based on CFTC data (Chart 49).
So positioning unwinding would actually help our short BRL/MXN strategy.
