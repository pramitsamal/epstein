pack of Trojans, and a tube of Crest toothpaste, please.” But four decades
later there were huge billboards, warning: “If you can’ t say no, use
condoms.” However, an executive of the Gannett Outdoor Advertising
Company confirmed that they held off putting up those signs until after a
visit by the Pope.

Members of the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy have been faced
with an interesting dilemma. On the one hand, they are opposed to
condoms as an artificial method of birth control. On the other hand, they
are aware that condoms can serve as a protection against AIDS. But a
group of bishops issued a statement that educational programs which
include information about condoms should also stress that they are
morally incorrect.

That’ s sort of like in the Watergate scandal when Richard Nixon
said, “We could get the million dollars—but that would be wrong.

Coincidentally, in November 2010, while the porn industry in
California was being pressured to require all male actors to wear condoms
to prevent AIDS, in the Vatican it was revealed that, for the exact same
reason, Pope Benedict--in his official capacity as the Church’ s chief spin
doctor--went on record proclaiming that under some circumstances it

might be acceptable for a (male) prostitute to use a condom.
