intended to become an underground abortion referral service, but it
wasn't going to stop just because in the next issue of 7he Realist | would
publish an interview with somebody else.

A few years later, state police raided Dr. Spencer's clinic and arrested
him. He remained out of jail only by the grace of political pressure from
those he'd helped. He was finally forced to retire from his practice, but |
continued mine, referring callers to other physicians that he had
recommended. Occasionally | would be offered money by a patient, but |
never accepted it. And whenever a doctor offered me a kickback, | refused,
but | also insisted that he give a discount for the same amount to those
patients referred by me.

Eventually, | was subpoenaed by district attorneys in two cities to
appear before grand juries investigating criminal charges against
abortionists. On both occasions | refused to testify, and each time the D.A.
tried to frighten me into cooperating with the threat of arrest.

In Liberty, New York, my name had been extorted from a patient by
threatening Aer with arrest. The D.A. told me that the doctor had
confessed everything and they got it all on tape. He gave me until two
o'clock that afternoon to change my mind about testifying, or else the

police would come to take me away.
