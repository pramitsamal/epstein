me and giggling. Somehow, | perceived her through the filter of arrogance
that people with power develop, and / assumed that she was giving me a
come-hither look. That simple misperception is what triggered this whole
long ordeal. | took her willingness for granted.

It was different with Monica Lewinsky. | mean to say, she flashed the
strap of her thong underwear—it made my heart go thump—and, you
know, I' m a prisoner at the White House. | can’ t go to a motel, but
Monica appeared like a gift from Heaven, and | succumbed to temptation.
| was fully cognizant that this was a very delicate situation—I even asked
for permission to kiss her—yet | blocked out my foresight. Way back in
college, when | tried to avoid military service, | was already thinking ahead
to campaigning for president, but now | found myself ignoring the
likelihood that Monica would not keep our relationship a secret.

| certainly didn’ t consider the possibility that she would become so
seriously involved with me. It was embarrassing to hear the tape that Linda
Tripp made, where Monica told her what she had said to me on the phone:

“| love you, Butthead.” | remember thinking when it happened, “Hey,
I' m the president of the United States, you can’ t call me Butthead.”
However, | immediately decided to treat the situation with humor. But she

hung up before | could say, “I love you, Beavis.”
