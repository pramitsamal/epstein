One other thing. My visual mantra of the man who urinated and
flossed simultaneously was replaced by a patriotic image of Cathy
O’ Brien: “I was ushered away from my classmates,” she said, “and
taken to an office where Michigan State Senator Guy VanderJagt was
waiting with soon-to-be-president Gerald Ford. They laughed as he placed
a small American flag in my rectum and instructed me to wave it.” Like all

politicians, though, Ford merely wrapped himself in the American flag.
