actually ate a rat. He did it to overcome his fear of eating rats. Certainly a
direct approach to the problem. None of that gesta/t shit. Now, I'm not
sure how he ate the rat, whether he just stuck it between a couple of slices

vegetables in a stew.

But there were rumors that when Leary and Liddy were on tour, the
Psychedelic Liberation Front found out their itinerary and began feeding
hash brownies to rats and releasing them, one by one, in Liddy's room at
the various motels he stayed at, while he was debating, in the hope that
nature would sooner or later take its course, and one night Liddy would
feel in the mood for a midnight snack, catch the rat that was left in the
room, eat it and, by extension, the hash brownie the rat had eaten, and
then Liddy would think he got stoned from eating the rat. This would, of
course, be right on the borderline on the ethics of dosing.
