| Played Thomas Jefferson’ s Violin

At a unique Heroes Convention, | met Lindsay Wagner, star of 7he

Bionic Woman. She was unaware that the CIA served as technical adviser
to her series, but she spoke poignantly of the positive influence that her
TV alter-ego had on young amputees she visited in hospitals.

| also met Tom Laughlin, of Bi//y Jack movie fame. A couple of years
later, he and his wife Delores Taylor invited me to a large dinner party.

They were Thomas Jefferson enthusiasts. In their home, there was
Thomas Jefferson's furniture, Thomas Jefferson's silverware, Thomas
Jefferson's recipes--we started with peanut soup--and even Thomas
Jefferson's violin.

| mentioned playing the violin as a child, and Laughlin invited me to
play this one. | hadn't held a violin for twenty-five years, not since | had
used it as a prop when | started doing stand-up comedy, and four decades
had passed since that concert in Carnegie Hall. It felt like a previous
incarnation. But now Billy Jack himself was handing me Thomas Jefferson's
violin. How could | resist?

“I'd like to dedicate this to Thomas Jefferson's slaves,” | said.
