IQ Test

Humans are intelligent. (If you disagree with this premise then
you're going to have a problem with this argument!) If you talk to a
computer and cannot tell it from a human, it must also be intelligent:
QED. The logic is sound but somehow feels wrong. It neatly, but
irritatingly, sidesteps the whole problem of defining intelligence.

In 1912, William Stern devised a method for measuring intelligence
in children. He named it ‘IQ’ from the German Intelligenz-Quotient.
You may have taken one of these tests at school. The tests consist of a
series of abstract reasoning problems that minimize cultural references.
For example, you might be asked to look at a set of blocks with dots on
them and identify which is the odd one out. Numerous versions of the
test have been developed over the years, but nowadays we mostly use one
of three standard tests, Wechsler being the most common.

Measuring intelligence is complicated. Culture and language play a
big part. If we take a tribe of Amazonian Indians and ask them to list the
presidents of the United States, they will fail. That does not mean they’re
stupid. Drop me into the Amazon Rainforest and I will probably starve
to death; they, on the other hand, can live off the land as hunter-gatherers
with only a few hours work per day. Who is more intelligent?

One problem with IQ is that individual candidate scores can differ
wildly from test to test, sometimes by as much as 20 points. That’s huge. At
the high end of the scale it can be the difference between being classified
as smart or as a genius; and, at the low end, between being average or
mentally subnormal. These variations don’t usually matter and most
universities and colleges take IQ with a pinch of salt, preferring more
specific tests such as SATs in America, the Baccalaureate in Europe or A
levels in the UK. IQ can be very important; and is sometimes a matter of
