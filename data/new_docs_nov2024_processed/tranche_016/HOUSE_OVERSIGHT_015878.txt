188 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

I know you're looking for the difference but you wont find one, as
I did not have time to write the numbers out in full. The 107° digit is
different, but even if I took the whole age of the universe and counted
as fast as possible I would not reach this digit. Any number greater
than, 10'”°/10 digits cannot be distinguished from another in the age
of the observable universe. Real numbers are in practice subject to an
uncertainty principle. Some mathematicians even wonder whether they
really exist. But, they do exist in our minds and our thought experiments.
In my view, any model of the Universe that ignores them is likely to be
wrong.

Each of the numbers could be random. There is no reason any set
of 10 digits is more likely than another, but it feels very unlikely that if
I tried to generate a random number I would get 15 consecutive digits.
What a human means by random is a jumbled up number: one with
varying digits that have no real pattern. An American mathematician,
George Chaitin has been able to explain this by saying that a random
number is uncompressible. This means there is no way to describe the
number more efficiently than writing it out in full. A string of ones
can be compressed. “Write a million 1s” takes only 18 characters, yet
accurately describes a number that is a million digits long. By contrast
8988376132 can't be compressed very much at all, its information
is just a jumble. There are many interesting numbers around. Some
numbers are Hamlet; some numbers are pi. One interesting number is
the following: 17733173332032037377. It is the genetic sequence for the
virus smallpox, or at least the first 20 digits. Copies of the full sequence
sit under lock and key in the Pasteur Institute in France and the CDC in
Atlanta. This number is a candidate for an ‘evil’ number. You might think
there are many numbers that could represent smallpox because there are
