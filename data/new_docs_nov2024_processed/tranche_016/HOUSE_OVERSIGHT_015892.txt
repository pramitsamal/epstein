Kénigsberg Bridges

Gédel

Gédel studied mathematics at Konigsberg University, Hilbert’s
hometown. Kénigsberg is famous for having a mathematical problem
related to the seven bridges that link the city together. It’s quite fun to try
to solve. Find a route across the city that crosses each bridge once and
once only. You can start anywhere, but no walking halfway over a bridge
and no swimming!

Euler discovered a rigorous mathematical proof that there can
be no solution in 1735 after five hundred years of failure by other
mathematicians. The answer is you cannot.

In 1931 Kurt Gédel, then working at the University of Vienna, proved
mathematics is like our sporting analogy. There are true statements in
mathematics that cannot be proven by the rules of the system. Someone
outside the system, with common sense, can see a statement is true, but
it’s impossible to prove this if you constrain yourself inside the system. It
is the equivalent of all the members of the London Marathon Committee
wondering what to do about the race while all of us watching the TV are
shouting, “It’s a draw!” Looking at the rulebook ‘really hard’ doesn't help.
