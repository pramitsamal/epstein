228 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

If there were, you could just write a program to sequentially present
every problem to the arbitrary problem solver and you would have
solved everything.

This presents us with a puzzle. A huge software industry has
grown up based on Turing’s ideas, employing tens of millions of people
worldwide. This industry regularly solves all manner of problems.
The proof from Turing’s original 1936 paper suggests there should be
quite strict limits on the power of computers. In the next chapter, we
will examine this industry and take a look at Turing’s theorem from a
modern view point. The chapter can be read as a stand alone article but
was originally written as an integral part of this book.
