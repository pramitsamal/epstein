It would have been much more helpful if the computer had said,
“You do not have enough balance in your account.” And, it would have
been more helpful still if it had asked whether I needed a temporary
overdraft. However, such a feature needs many more lines of software
and this is time-consuming to write.

Software takes time and is expensive, because it has to be written
in a general-purpose way. Any name could substitute for James Tagg,
and any amount could be used. After all, it would be useless if an ATM
machine could only give out $20 to one person. The generalization of
software makes use of variables instead of fixed values and this renders
it hard to understand. Wherever we meet an idea that needs to be
generalized, a letter must be used instead of a fixed value. Computer
programs tend to look like this: if @ wants to do ‘b’ with ‘c then allow
it only if ‘@ is greater than ‘c. The software programmer has to keep
track of all the possible values that could be inserted into each of the
variables and make sure each and every combination would make sense.
My ATM scenario gets complex quickly. It needs to be able to answer a
range of questions for all the bank’s customers, deal with any amount of
