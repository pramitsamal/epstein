Long Multiplication

back to your childhood. Do you recall being taught long multiplication
at school? Take a look at the next illustration and it will all come flooding
back. Once you learn the process of long multiplication you can follow
the rules and get the right answer for any similar problem every time. To
do this, you lay out the calculation in a particular format and apply the
logic. Multiply each number by a single digit of the other number and
then add the results together.

Diophantine problems are a little more complex than long
multiplication and some of them are a bit abstruse. But there is one
very famous Diophantine problem we can all recite. “The square on the
hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides” The
equation for a Pythagorean triangle.

The theorem applies to right-angled triangles and there are sixteen
whole number solutions, known as Pythagorean triples; three, four, five;
is one example.
