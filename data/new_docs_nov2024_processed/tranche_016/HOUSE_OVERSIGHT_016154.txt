likely be sufficient to improve market confidence.

CMA reforms (likely linked to the NTP), a potential catalyst for market rerating
Furthermore, reforms being introduced by the Saudi Capital Markets Authority (CMA) to
attract greater foreign participation in the Saudi market (see below) indicate Saudi is
