Ambitious natural gas expansion

The NTP also focuses on expanding natural gas production. The government aims to
grow the existing production by 48%, largely through non-traditional routes. According
to the minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, natural gas accounts for 50%
of energy production and the target is to increase this to 70% by 2020 through
expanding local production or importing if necessary. The government’s priority will be
to explore the option of local production, although imports were, for the first time, not
excluded. We consider this as an interesting development as importing LNG into Saudi
costs the same as producing it internally through non-traditional routes, in our view. The
Saudi statement acknowledges that Saudi Arabia is willing to be open to the possibility
should imports provide a more economic means for this purpose.
