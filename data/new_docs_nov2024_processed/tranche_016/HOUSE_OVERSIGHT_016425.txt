os Annexed hereto as Exhibit C is a true and correct copy of an article written by

requested copies of the briefs filed by the District Attorney’s office in the above-captioned
appeal. Ms. Edelman stated that names of victims could be redacted before the briefs were
disclosed.

a Mr. Frost responded that he could not provide Ms. Edelman with copies of the
briefs because they were filed under seal pursuant to N.Y. Civil Rights Law 50-b and that the
District Attorney’s office could only release the briefs, even with victims’ names redacted, if this
Court ordered the briefs to be unsealed.

court asks the People for our position, we will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief”
(emphasis in original). A true and correct copy of that email correspondence is annexed hereto
as Exhibit D.

longer represents Mr. Epstein and referred me to Martin Weinberg, who currently acts as counsel
for Mr. Epstein.

10... On or about December 20, 2018, I spoke with Mr. Weinberg and explained the

nature of the Post’s motion to unseal the redacted briefs and the position taken by the Manhattan
