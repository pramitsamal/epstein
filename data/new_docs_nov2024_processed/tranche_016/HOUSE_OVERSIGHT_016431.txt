After he hung up, the man turned over and dropped his towel, exposing himself.
He told Licata to get comfortable and then, in a firm voice, told her to take off
her clothes.

At 16, Licata had never before been fully naked in front of anyone. Shaking and
panicked, she mechanically pulled off her jeans and stripped down to her
underwear. He set the timer for 30 minutes and then reached over and
unsnapped her bra. He then began touching her with one hand and masturbating
himself with the other.

“I kept looking at the timer because I didn’t want to have this mental image of
what he was doing,”’ she remembered of the massage. “He kept trying to put his
fingers inside me and told me to pinch his nipples. He was mostly saying ‘just do
that, harder, harder and do this. ...’ ”

After he ejaculated, he stood up and walked to the shower, dismissing her as if
she had been in history class.

It wasn’t long before a lot of Licata’s fellow students at Royal Palm Beach High
School had heard about “a creepy old guy” named Jeffrey who lived in a pink
waterfront mansion and was paying girls $200 to $300 to give him massages that
quickly turned sexual.

Eventually, the Palm Beach police, and then the FBI, came knocking on Licata’s
door. In the police report, Licata was referred to as a Jane Doe in order to protect
her identity as a minor.
