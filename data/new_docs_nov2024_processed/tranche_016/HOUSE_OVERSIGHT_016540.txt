103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *904

U.S. victims lack a right to challenge noncharging decisions in cases of homicides by police. But they, along with organized
interest groups, can lobby prosecutors to prosecute. In some cities, voters and activist groups have pressured local prosecutors
on police violence cases. °° It is difficult to assess what role public sentiment plays (and should play) in charging decisions.
But it is not hard to find instances of potent political challenges to non-prosecution of police officers in the wake of fatal
shootings. Chief prosecutors in Cleveland, Ohio, and Chicago, Illinois, lost reelection bids in the wake controversial failures to
charge police officers in fatal-shooting cases. 7°7 In the midst of popular and activist attention on such cases, prosecutors in
several other cities have charged officers for offenses related to suspects' deaths, with mixed records of success. 7°8 Chicago
prosecutors did so a year [*905] after police fatally shot a suspect and only upon public release of video of the incident 7° - a
scenario that suggests public attention corrected a noncharging decision influenced by improper considerations.

However, U.S. localities vary widely in their demographics, politics, and community sentiments toward these cases. 7!° That
variation, plus local election of prosecutors, contributes to widely varying enforcement policies across prosecution offices. 7!!
And it means victims who urge prosecutions when local majority sentiment disfavors it have lower odds of successfully
influencing [*906] prosecutors. The political variability of local prosecutors’ charging policies - and the vulnerability of those
decisions to local sentiment that favors unjustified underenforcement - are a key reason federal redundancy is important in this
context. Given that police misconduct is an established part of the U.S. Justice Department's enforcement agenda, federal
prosecutors should be a check on political judgments of local prosecutors. They also provide victims with a different agency to

appeal to for investigation and prosecution.

This federalism-based model of redundant enforcement has advantages as a strategy to reduce risks of unmerited
underenforcement. The alternative model authorizing judicial review of declination decisions, as is used in England, relies on
the independence of judges from the prosecutors whom they review. *!* The federalism model relies on the independence of
federal prosecutors from state prosecutors and police. The executive branch of one sovereign scrutinizes the enforcement
response of another. And it has the capacity to act on its independent judgment, while courts are confined to ordering

6 See United States v. Gamble, 694 Fed. App'x. 750 (11th Cir. 2017), cert. granted, Gamble v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2707 (2018). Even
if the Court abolishes the dual sovereignty doctrine in Gamble, federal and state prosecutors will continue to be able to prosecute the same
offenders for the same conduct in many cases. Under Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932), the Double Jeopardy Clause
precludes multiple prosecutions only if the subsequent charge has the same elements as the first. See United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688,
696 (1993) (affirming Blockburger's same-elements test as the sole basis for double jeopardy claims). Unlike the firearm offenses that gave
rise to Gamble's Double Jeopardy claim, federal and state crimes covering the same conduct often have distinct elements. For an example, see
infra notes 200-02 and accompanying text.

federal prosecution of same conduct after state prosecution).
