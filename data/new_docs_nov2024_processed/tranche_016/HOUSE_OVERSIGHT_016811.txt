Hans Ulrich Obrist: Making the Invisible Visible: Art Meets AI

Many contemporary artists are articulating various doubts about the promises of AI and
reminding us not to associate the term “artificial intelligence” solely with positive
outcomes.

Alison Gopnik: AlIs versus Four-Year-Olds
Looking at what children do may give programmers useful hints about directions for
computer learning.

Peter Galison: Algorists Dream of Objectivity

infinite.

George M. Church: The Rights of Machines
Probably we should be less concerned about us-versus-them and more concerned about
the rights of all sentients in the face of an emerging unprecedented diversity of minds.

Caroline A. Jones: The Artistic Use of Cybernetic Beings
The work of cybernetically inclined artists concerns the emergent behaviors of life that
elude AI in its current condition.

The most dramatic discontinuity will surely be when we achieve effective human
immortality. Whether this will be achieved biologically or digitally isn’t clear, but
inevitably it will be achieved.
