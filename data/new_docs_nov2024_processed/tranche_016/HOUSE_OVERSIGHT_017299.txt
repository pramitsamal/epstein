foreign governments. In 1999, I received a letter of thanks from the head of that shadowy
organization, which included the following:

“T remember the energy you showed when we came to you seeking both advice and
action. You threw yourself into the fray and showed every possible willingness to give us
both your time and renowned counsel.

As you know, there is no greater “Mitzva” in Judaism than “Pidyon Shevuyim”—prisoner
release. And nevertheless, not every person would be prepared to be associated with “one
of us.” So be it you, for your part, acted in the best and nobles of our traditions.

We wish you well; we thank you for what you did and what you were willing to do. May
we all live to see the day when a profession such as mine gives way to more pleasant
occupations. There is still some way to go before this comes about.”

Tragically, the world is still far from a time when those brave men and women who serve in the
United States and Israeli armed forces and intelligence services can pursue “more pleasant

occupations.” Until that day arrives, I will always remain available to lend my time and counsel in
support of their noble efforts to combat evil.
