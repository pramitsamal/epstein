boxes with real pleadings in it and a Jot of other
information in it. The fact that there was real money

to you?
A. Because of who was on it.
Q. Who was on it?
A. J] don't recall, but ] do recall saying to
the investors -- ] recall having a conversation prior
to the investors coming in with Russ Adler and Russ
had told me that Epstein had flown Bill Clinton on his

plane, had flown Prince Andrew on his plane. And ]
don't remember whether that was on any of the flight

manifests or not, but ] left that to the investors’
imagination as to what they were being told about
Mr. Epstein and these other famous people that were
cavorting with Mr. Epstein and Jet them Jook at the
file.

You have to understand from an investor's
perspective -- hang on. From an investor's

perspective the only thing that matters to the

investor is that it's a real case and that they can

verify that real dollars are being paid. The fact

that it was a real case was evident, I had a lot of

being paid was a fiction that was created by me and my

co-conspirators, everyone from bankers, to computer
people. So the actual role of the case, and ] want to

make sure you understand this, the actual role of the

actual physical case in the Ponzi scheme is, from my
perspective, minimal. It was just another vehicle for

me,
“OQ. After that initial meeting with the

investors where they looked at the file, what happened
with respect to their desire or lack of desire to

invest?

MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. I'm going to
object to the form of the question, it assumes facts
not in evidence. There's been no testimony that the
investors actually looked at the files, only that
they were given the opportunity to look at the files.
BY MS. HADDAD:

Q. Was your video surveillance on when you left
the investors alone in your office?

A. No, no, ] didn't have cameras in my office.
I didn't let people look in my office when I] was in
there, that would have been bad.

Q. So you Jeft them alone in there?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall for approximately how long?

A. No more than 20, 30 minutes. It was a short

period of time,
Q. When you went back in what happened?

a specific recollection of having significant e-mail

telling me I did, I'l] accept that, but ] don't recall
