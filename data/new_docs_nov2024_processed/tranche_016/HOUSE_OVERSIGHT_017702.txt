materially altered by attending the trial. >? Because the Advisory Committee proposal essentially tracks my proposal, it is not
necessary to discuss this issue here.

(New) Rule 60(a)(3) - Victims’ Right to be Heard on Bail, Plea, Sentencing and Other Issues The Proposals:

I proposed not only specific rules allowing victim to be heard at release, plea, and sentencing hearings but also a general rule
giving victims the right to be heard on all issues directly affecting their rights as follows:

Right to be Heard on Victims' Issues. In addition to rights to be heard established elsewhere in these rules, at any public
proceeding at which a victim has the right to attend, the victim has the right to be heard on any matter directly affecting a
victim's right. °7+

The Advisory Committee proposed only a narrow rule giving victims the right to be heard at only three specific points in the
process - bail, plea, and sentencing hearings:

Right to Be Heard. The court must permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court

concerning release, plea, or sentencing involving the crime. **°

[*956] Discussion:

The Advisory Committee's proposed general rule on the victim's right to be heard is inferior to weaving that right into the
specific rules on release, plea, and sentencing. This issue is discussed earlier in this Article. °2° The larger issue to pursue here
is the silence of the Advisory Committee on how a court should proceed when a victim's rights under the CVRA are at stake in
other proceedings. For example, what if the court is considering continuing a trial in violation of a victim's right to
proceedings free from unreasonable delay? °27 Or excluding the victim from a proceeding in violation of a victim's right not
to be excluded from ... public court proceeding? > Or turning over to the defense personal and confidential information
about the victim in violation of a victim's night to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and
privacy? *°° Or giving a defendant the victim's home address in an alibi situation in violation of the victim's right to be
reasonably protected from the accused? °7°

My proposed rule would state directly that the victim has the right to be heard on such issues. How the Advisory Committee
would handle such issues is unclear. The Advisory Committee's proposed rule on the victim's right to be heard only confers
such a right for three specific hearings. The listing of three hearings might seem to suggest victims could not be heard
elsewhere. But denying victims a chance to be heard at other hearings where their rights are implicated is such an obvious
violation of fundamental notions of fairness (not to mention the victim's right to fairness under the CVRA) that one should be
reluctant to ascribe that position to the Advisory Committee.
