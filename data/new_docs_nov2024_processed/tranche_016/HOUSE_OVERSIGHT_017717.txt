2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, #839

information is subpoenaed from third parties - such as schools or medical providers - even though victims have compelling
privacy interests to protect. ® And the rules do not protect the victim's right to attend trials, despite [*840] victims' long
history of having at least some protected interest in observing trials and other proceedings. ?

One provision conveniently encapsulates the surprising absence of victims from the rules: Rule 32(d)(2)(B). The drafters of this
rule '° appear to have been so afraid to utter the word victim that they did not use the term even when describing the person
harmed by a crime. Rule 32(d)(2)(B) directs that a presentence report contain verified information, stated in a
nonargumentative style, that assesses the financial, social, psychological, and medical impact on any individual against whom
the offense has been committed. !! The phrasing of this provision is striking for several reasons. It eschews the
straightforward term victim, preferring instead the obscuring phrase “individual against whom the offense has been
committed. The provision also uses the responsibility-obscuring passive voice in describing the individual against whom the
offense has been committed, leaving the reader to wonder who might have committed that offense (the defendant, perhaps?).
Interestingly, the provision requires that information about the victim be verified. Fair enough - until one realizes that the
directly adjacent provision regarding information about the defendant lacks a similar verification requirement. !* Why would
information about the victim need to be verified while information about the defendant would not? Finally, the provision
requires that victim information be stated in a nonargumentative style. Again, the adjacent defendant's provision contains no
such direction. !3 In short, even a rule that seemingly must mention victims - the rule dictating preparation of a presentence
report describing the crime - manages to avoid mentioning the word.

B. The Victims' Rights Movement

That victims are missing from the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure exemplifies their treatment in the modern American
[*841] criminal justice system. As one commentator has described the situation, the victim is seen at best as the forgotten
man! of the system and, at worst, as being twice victimized, the second time by the very system to which he has turned for
justice. '4 The absence of victims conflicts with a public sense of justice keen enough that it has found voice in a nationwide
victims’ rights movement. !°
The crime victims’ rights movement developed in the 1970s because of a perceived imbalance in the criminal justice system.
Led by feminist and civil rights activists, victims’ advocates argued that the criminal justice system had become preoccupied
