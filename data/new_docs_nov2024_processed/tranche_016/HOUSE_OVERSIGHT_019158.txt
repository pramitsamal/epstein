Hundreds. Hundreds. I was—he used to tell me I was his

favorite. He bought me a car. He bought me—

- This Jeep that you're driving?

plane ticket to New York; I got spending money whenever |

wanted. Like, 1 was in there deep. | was—he asked my par-

ents to emancipate me so | could live with him. Or he didn't

ask my parents, he asked me to ask my parents, I'm sorry. He

school year. But I remember that for the last, like, six or eight

to him. Because he—he asked me t

like, like suck him and stuff [giggles], and 1 was just like, no. —

Definitely not. | was like, “I'll let you touch me, but I’m not

gonna do that.”
