CHAPTER I4

Wendy Dobbs, interview with Detective Recarey and
Sergeant Frick, October 3, 2005, transcribed from
video (excerpts)

RECAREY: Okay. Your Pepsi’s coming, my Pepsi’s coming. First
of all, I know you're freaking out. Don’t freak out, just relax.
Okay? I want to thank you for coming. All right? Though the
door’s closed, you're free to go at any time. You’re not here —
you know, it’s only closed for our privacy.

DOBBS: That’s fine.

_ RECAREY: I understand that you may have information on a
case that we’re looking into, okay? That’s the reason why I
brought you here today. All right? And again, you’re here vol-
untarily. You agreed to come back with us and talk to us. But
I do want to talk you about Jeff Epstein, and the whole...

= thing.

_ DOBBS: And I don’t need a lawyer, right?
