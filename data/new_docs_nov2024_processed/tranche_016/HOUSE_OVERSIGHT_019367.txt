Police say
lawyer tried
to discredit
teenage girls

By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
Famed Harvard Jaw professor Alan
Dershowitz met with the Palm Beach
County State Attorney’s Office and pro-

vided damaging information about teen- .

age girls who say they gave his client,
Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein,
sexually charged massages, according to
police reports.

The reports also state that another
Epstein attorney agreed to a plea bargain

that would have allowed Epstein tohaveno |

criminal record. His current attorney de-

father of at least one girl complained that
private investigators aggressively fol-

Police believed there was probable
cause to charge Epstein with the more
serious crimes of unlawful sex acts with a
minor and lewd and lascivious molesta-
tion. Police Chief Michael Reiter was so
angry that he wrote State Attorney Barry
Krischer a memo in May suggesting he
disqualify himself from the case. .

The case originally was going to be
presented to the grand jury in February,
but was postponed after Dershowitz pro-
