Lawyer: Juro® often believe @lults over kids

> EPSTEIN fom 1B

his current job, has returned
$10,000 to him because of the
Palm Beach scandal, the New
York Daily News has reported.

Rather than file charges,
the state attorney’s office
presented the case to a
county grand jury. The panel
indicted Epstein last week on
a single, Jess serious charge
of felony solicitation of pros-
titution.

The case raised eyebrows
because the state attorney’s
office rarely, if ever, kicks
such charges to a grand jury.
And it increases the difficulty
of prosecuting child sex
abuse cases, especially when
the defendant is enormously
wealthy and can hire high-
priced, top-tier lawyers.

At least one of Epstein’s
alleged victims told police he
knew she was underage
when the two of them got
naked for massages and sex-
ual activity. She was 16 years
old at the time and said Ep-
stein asked her questions
about her high school, ac-
cording to police reports.

A girl who said she met
Epstein when she was 15 said
he told her if she told any-
body what happened at his
house, bad things could hap-
pen, the police reports state.

Epstein’s youngest al-
leged victim was 14 when she
says she gave him a massage
that included some sexual
activity. She is now 16. The
girl's father says he doesn’t
know whether she told Ep
stein her age.

“My daughter has kept a
lot of whathappened from me
because of sheer embarrass-
ment,” he said. “But she very
much looked 14. Any prudent
man would have had second
thoughts about that.”

Defense attorney Jack
Goldberger maintains that
not only did Epstein pass a
polygraph test showing he
did not know the girls were
minors, but thei stories
weren't credible. The state
attorney’s office also implied
that their credibility was an
issue when it decided not to
charge Epstein directly, but
instead give the case to the
grand jury.

“A prosecutor has to look
at it in a much broader fash-
ion,” a state attorney’s
spokesman said last week.

Epstein hired Harvard
law Professor Alan Der
showitz when. he became
aware he was under investi-

_ gation, and Dershowitz gave

prosecutors information that
some of the alleged victims
had spoke of using alcohol
and marijuana on a popular
Web sife, according to a Palm
Beach police report.

Prosecutors typically
consider two things in decid-
ing whether to charge some-
body with sex-related offens-
e$ against minors — whether
there is sufficient evidence
and whether there is a public
interest in doing so, Dekle
said.

Child sex abuse cases
often are difficult
to prosecute, an
attorney says.

Iftwo teens are in a sexual
relationship and the boy
turns 18 before the girl, he
could be charged with a sex
crime if the sex continues,
There would be no public in-
terest in pursuing that, Dekle
said.

But where there is a large
gap in ages — and especially
in cases of teachers with stu-
dents — there is a public in-
terest in prosecuting, he said.
Likewise if the accused has a
track record of sex with mi
nors.

Still there is a “universal
constant” in prosecuting
these cases, Dekle said. Men
who exploit underage chil-
dren for sex often carefully
choose their victims in ways

. that will minimize the risk to

them, he said.

Victims usually are froma
lower social status, and they

may suffer from psychologi-
cal problems, Dekle said.

“Lots of child sexual
abuse victims have been vic-
timized by multiple people
over a period of time. Then
the act of abuse produces
behavior in the victims that
further damages their cred?
bility.” Examples include
promiscuous behavior and
drug abuse.

Some of the alleged vic-
tims in the Epstein case re-
turned to his home multiple
times for the massage ses-
sions and the $200 to $300 he
typically paid them per visit.
“That would be a definite

problem for the prosecttor,”

said Betty Resch, who prose-
cuted crimes against children
in Palm Beach County for five
years and now is in private
practice in Lake Worth.

“The victim becomes less
sympathetic” to a jury, Resch
said. “But she’s a victim nev-
ertheless. She’s a kid.”

Most men charged with
sex crimes against minors
look normal, Dekle said. A
jury expecting to see 4 mon-
ster seldom will. And the vic-

tims’ ages work against them
and in favor of the defendant
in a trial, Dekle said.

If a child and an adult tell
different stories and both
swear they're telling the
truth, adult jurors are more
likely to believe the aduit,
Dekle said.

“You have all these things
working against you ina child
sex abuse case. Prosecutors
normally try to be very care-
ful in filing those cases be-
cause they know what they're
getting into. There is no such
thing as an ironclad child
sexual abuse case.”
