poor-fish Jarvanka flunky—and he believed she had now deeply implicated herself in the
entire disaster by participating in the Air Force One meeting. The next day, with more
inquiries coming from reporters, he confronted Hicks inside the cabinet room, accusing
her of doing Jared and Ivanka’s dirty work. The face-off quickly escalated into an
existential confrontation between the two sides of the White House—two sides on a total
war footing.

“You dont know what you’re doing,” shouted a livid Bannon at Hicks, demanding to
know who she worked for, the White House or Jared and Ivanka. “You dont know how
much trouble you are in,” he screamed, telling her that if she didn’t get a lawyer he would
call her father and tell him he had better get her one. “You are dumb as a stone!” Moving
from the cabinet room across the open area into the president’s earshot, “a loud, scary,
clearly threatening” Bannon, in the Jarvanka telling, yelled, “7 am going to fuck you and
your little group!’ with a baffled president plaintively wanting to know, “What’s going
on?”

In the Jarvanka-side account, Hicks then ran from Bannon, hysterically sobbing and
“visibly terrified.” Others in the West Wing marked this as the high point of the boiling
enmity between the two sides. For the Jarvankas, Bannon’s rant was also a display that
they believed they could use against him. The Jarvanka people pushed Priebus to refer the
matter to the White House counsel, billing this as the most verbally abusive moment in the
history of the West Wing, or at least certainly up among the most abusive episodes ever.

For Bannon, this was just more Jarvanka desperation—they were the ones, not him,
saddled with Comey-Mueller. They were the ones panicking and out of control.

For the rest of his time in the White House, Bannon would not speak to Hicks again.
