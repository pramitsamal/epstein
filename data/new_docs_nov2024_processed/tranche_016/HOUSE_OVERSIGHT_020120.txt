ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I am grateful to Janice Min and Matthew Belloni at the Hollywood Reporter, who,
eighteen months ago, got me up one morning to jump on a plane in New York and that
evening interview the unlikely candidate in Los Angeles. My publisher, Stephen Rubin,
and editor, John Sterling, at Henry Holt have not only generously supported this book but
shepherded it with enthusiasm and care on an almost daily basis. My agent, Andrew
Wylie, made this book happen, as usual, virtually overnight.

Michael Jackson at Two Cities TV, Peter Benedek at UTA, and my lawyers, Kevin
Morris and Alex Kohner, have patiently pushed this project forward.

A libel reading can be like a visit to the dentist. But in my long experience, no libel
lawyer is more nuanced, sensitive, and strategic than Eric Rayman. Once again, almost a
pleasure.

Many friends, colleagues, and generous people in the greater media and political world
have made this a smarter book, among them Mike Allen, Jonathan Swan, John Homans,
Franklin Foer, Jack Shafer, Tammy Haddad, Leela de Kretser, Stevan Keane, Matt Stone,
Edward Jay Epstein, Simon Dumenco, Tucker Carlson, Joe Scarborough, Piers Morgan,
Juleanna Glover, Niki Christoff, Dylan Jones, Michael Ledeen, Mike Murphy, Tim Miller,
Larry McCarthy, Benjamin Ginsberg, Al From, Kathy Ruemmler, Matthew Hiltzik, Lisa
Dallos, Mike Rogers, Joanna Coles, Steve Hilton, Michael Schrage, Matt Cooper, Jim
Impoco, Michael Feldman, Scott McConnell, and Mehreen Maluk.

My appreciation to fact-checkers Danit Lidor, Christina Goulding, and Joanne Gerber.

My greatest thanks to Victoria Floethe, for her support, patience, and insights, and for
her good grace in letting this book take such a demanding place in our lives.
