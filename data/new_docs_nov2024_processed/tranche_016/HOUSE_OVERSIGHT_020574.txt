10 Several of these groups conduct outreach to elected officials. Summaries of Chinese New Year and
other galas regularly mention the presence of American officials or their representatives. The Philadelphia-
based Shenzhen Chamber’s New Year’s party included a city council member and a county commissioner. A
member of the House of Representatives from California has appeared at several events hosted by different
organizations, including a January 2018 forum organized by the Wenzhou chamber that was subsequently
featured prominently on the website of another United Front organization, the All America Chinese Youth
Federation. In another instance, the former mayor of a California city attended a meeting hosted bya
chamber welcoming a visiting Overseas Chinese affairs official from Hebei province. There is no reason to
believe that any of these politicians are aware of the groups’ interactions with the Chinese party-state. See

11 For example, in the United States, the Jiangsu chamber’s launch event in California was attended by

a vice chair of the Provincial Standing Committee; a Shenzhen chamber’s launch event, also in California,
was joined by Lin Jie of Guangdong Province’s United Front department; and in 2016, the California-based
Guangdong chamber itself hosted a provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs department secretary. In China,
the America-China Enterprise Chamber of Commerce met a provincial United Front official in Fujian in
September 2017; a US-based Zhejiang chamber was received in Hangzhou by a provincial CPPCC vice
chair who manages Overseas Chinese work; and the leader of the Inner Mongolia-chamber met with

that province’s Overseas Chinese Association chair in 2016. See “HX ESLARBMARIWZ.” Chinese American
