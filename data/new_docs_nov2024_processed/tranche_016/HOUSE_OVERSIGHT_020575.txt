25 Wanhua Chemical joined the American Chemistry Council, which has spent over $40 million over
the 2012, 2014, and 2016 election cycles. Alibaba joined the American Legislative Exchange Council,

a group known for its success in effectively ghostwriting legislation in legislatures nationwide. These
associations, which operate as nonprofit 501(c)(6) corporations, are not subject to detailed disclosure
requirements, making it difficult to ascertain whether the funds contributed by foreign members are
being used for political purposes. Similarly, 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations, while limited to
spending no more than half of their expenditures on political activities, do not have to disclose the
names of their donors, making it possible for foreign donors, who are prevented from making political
contributions, to conceal their involvement. See Lee, Fang. “Chinese State-Owned Chemical Firm Joins
