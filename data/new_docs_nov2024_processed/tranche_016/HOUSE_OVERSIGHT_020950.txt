Balance Sheet: Observations of Last Ten Years

e Unfunded promise of future entitlement spending grew 6x to -$31
trillion, owing to rapidly rising healthcare cost + new Medicare Part D
program + aging population in the medium-future.

e Federal net debt outstanding more than doubled to $9 trillion on the
back of chronic budget deficits, two major recessions in 2001 and 2008,
and growing entitlement spending.

e Federal employee & veteran benefits outstanding also more than
doubled, to $5.7 trillion, thanks to rising healthcare costs and ongoing

war on terror.
