Rising Obesity Pushes Up Healthcare Cost

e An estimated 7% of $2.1 trillion healthcare costs
(including those linked to diabetes, cancer, heart /
respiratory / joint diseases) were related to obesity in
2008. By comparison, that’s more than all corporate
income tax revenue that year.

Note: Nearly half of all people in the U.S. with European ancestry carry a variant of the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO)
gene, vs. 25% of U.S. Hispanics, 15% of African Americans and 15% of Asian Americans, per UCLA.
