Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Forces that Push Up

Healthcare Spending

1) Open access healthcare plans can increase access to care
(via greater choices of care providers), but can also
increase cost.

2) Consumers and providers are not always incentivized to
constrain their healthcare costs.

3) Even when appropriate, poor information & lack of price
transparency complicate comparison shopping for
consumers.

4) Advances in medical technology drive demand and costs.
