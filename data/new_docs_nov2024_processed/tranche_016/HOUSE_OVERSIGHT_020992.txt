Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors—

Poor Information & Lack of Price Transparency
Make it Harder for Consumers to “Comparison Shop”

Patients are at a healthcare information disadvantage in two respects’:

¢ Lack of transparency:

>» Its harder for consumers to compare prices of healthcare services from
different healthcare providers than in other consumer markets given the
complexity of healthcare market.

> With employer- / government-subsidized insurance, many patients are
‘locked in’ with their insurance plans that do not incentivize “shopping
around.”

* Knowledge gap:
> Unlike other markets where consumers tend to use their own information and
preferences, consumers depend more on the advice and guidance of
physicians or other healthcare suppliers.

> Unlike other “merchandise,” healthcare is literally of life-and-death
importance to consumers, making risk aversion — and price
insensitivity — higher. This price insensitivity is exacerbated because the

consumer, in effect, gets it at a discounted price anyway.
