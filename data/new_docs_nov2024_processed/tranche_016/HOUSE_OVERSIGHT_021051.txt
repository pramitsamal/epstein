However, in Longer Term, Credit Rating Agencies Have Begun to Worry

About USA Inc.’s Debt Affordability

On balance, we believe that the ratings of all large Aaa governments [including
USA Inc.] remain well positioned, although their ‘distance-to-downgrade’ has
in all cases substantially diminished...Growth alone will not resolve an
increasingly complicated debt equation...Preserving debt affordability at levels
consistent with Aaa ratings will invariably require fiscal adjustments of a
magnitude that, in some cases, will test social cohesion. '

.../f there are not offsetting measures to reverse the deterioration in negative
fundamentals in the U.S., the likelihood of a negative outlook over the next two
years will increase. 2

Note: 1) Treasury swap spread = Treasury yield — swap rate (between bonds of comparable maturity); swap rate is the fixed interest rate that the buyer demands in
exchange for the uncertainty of paying the short-term LIBOR (floating) rate over time; swap rates are generally higher than Treasury yields with corresponding
maturities as they include incremental credit risk associated with the banks that provide swaps compared to Treasuries, which are viewed as risk-free. 2)10-year
Treasury swap spread turned negative on 3/24/10, while 30-year Treasury swap spread turned negative in 10/08 and shorter-term Treasury swap spreads are still
positive. Source: Bloomberg.
