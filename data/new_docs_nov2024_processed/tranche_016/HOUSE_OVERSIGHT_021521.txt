WEST PALM BEACH — The parents of a
teenage girl sued part-time Palm Beach resi-
dent Jeffrey Epstein for more than $50 million
on Thursday, alleging that the wealthy money
manager had her brought to his mansion for
a massage, then engaged in sexual activity
with her.

The girl, identified only as Jane Doe, was
14 at the time. She was the youngest of sev-
eral alleged victims of Epstein, according
to Palm Beach police, who spent 11 months
investigating him.

The federal lawsuit, filed by Miami at-
torhey Jeffrey Herman, says “Epstein has a
sexual preference and obsession for under

 age minor girls.” Epstein “gained access to

}

primarily disadvantaged minor girls in his
home, sexually assaulted these -girls, and
then gave them money.”

Herman, who specializes in. child sex -

abuse litigation, sued on behalf of the girl,
her father and her stepmother on grounds
of sexual assault, intentional infliction of
emotional distress and loss of parental con-
sortium.
. Jane Doe ... fell into Epstein’s trap and
became one of his victims,” the lawsuit says.
“We're dismayed by the filing of the law-
suit, but not surprised,” said Jack Goldberger,
