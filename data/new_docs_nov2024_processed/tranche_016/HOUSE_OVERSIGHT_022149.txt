“Pm thrilled they sued me,” he'd told reporters. “In the end,
someone will be disbarred. Either it will be me or the two
lawyers.”

But if Dershowitz was swinging for the fences in his struggle
to keep his hard-earned reputation afloat, he still had a bomb-
shell to drop. When deposed by Scarola, he proposed his own
theory about why Virginia Roberts had named him, along with
Prince Andrew, as one of the men who had sexually abused her
at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch, in New York City, and in Palm
Beach.

A theory that implicated the lawyers who were suing him ina
much larger conspiracy.

According to Dershowitz, Brad Edwards pressured Virginia
Roberts into identifying Dershowitz as one her assailants.

Dershowitz said that Edwards did this so that they could
blackmail Jeffrey Epstein’s patron Leslie Wexner for one billion
dollars.

Roberts lied about him, Dershowitz maintained, to give
Wexner an idea of what would happen to him if Edwards's
demands weren't met.

Furthermore, Dershowitz said, he had proof.
