The apartments above, set for completion and leasing in the spring of 2016, will have
layouts that skew in favor of three- and four-bedrooms. “There will be thermostats
programmable remotely on all the A/C units, and motorized shades in some of the
units,” says Bryan Cho, executive vice president at Related Companies. “From the
marble bathrooms to the highly designed public spaces and the amenities, it’s what’s
usually in condominiums.”

On the rental market sooner is The Rose Modern, a 20-story, 82-unit tower currently
finishing up construction on York Avenue. The leasing office will open the first week of
October offering “competitive” rents for a luxury building, according to Bond New
York’s Douglas Wagner, with move-ins slated for November and December.

Want to buy now, and move in immediately? The building most ahead of the curve is
The Charles. Previously stalled after 2008’s downturn, the 32-story condo at 1355 First
Ave. got redesigned to emphasize large full-floor apartments before breaking ground
in 2012. And it’s paid off. There are four units left out of 27 total, which started at
$5.97 million. A recent sale of the top six floors to two unidentified relatives for a total
of $59 million made headlines. That price? On First Avenue?
