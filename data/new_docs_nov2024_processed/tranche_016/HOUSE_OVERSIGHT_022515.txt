to gain a business advantage.” For example, bribe payments
made to secure favorable tax treatment, to reduce or elimi-
nate customs duties, to obtain government action to pre-
vent competitors from entering a market, or to circumvent
a licensing or permit requirement, all satisfy the business
purpose test.

In 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
addressed the business purpose test in United States v. Kay
and held that bribes paid to obtain favorable tax treatment—
which reduced a company’s customs duties and sales taxes
on imports—could constitute payments made to “obtain
or retain” business within the meaning of the FCPA.° The
court explained that in enacting the FCPA, “Congress meant
to prohibit a range of payments wider than only those that
directly influence the acquisition or retention of govern-
ment contracts or similar commercial or industrial arrange-
ments.” The Kay court found that “[tJhe congressional
target was bribery paid to engender assistance in improving
the business opportunities of the payor or his beneficiary,
irrespective of whether that assistance be direct or indirect,
and irrespective of whether it be related to administering
the law, awarding, extending, or renewing a contract, or

executing or preserving an agreement.””' Accordingly, Kay

held that payments to obtain favorable tax treatment can,

under appropriate circumstances, violate the FCPA:

Avoiding or lowering taxes reduces operating costs
and thus increases profit margins, thereby freeing up
funds that the business is otherwise legally obligated
to expend. And this, in turn, enables it to take any
number of actions to the disadvantage of competi-
tors. Bribing foreign officials to lower taxes and cus-
toms duties certainly cam provide an unfair advantage
over competitors and thereby be of assistance to the

payor in obtaining or retaining business.

[W]e hold that Congress intended for the FCPA
to apply broadly to payments intended to assist the
payor, either directly or indirectly, in obtaining or
retaining business for some person, and that bribes
paid to foreign tax officials to secure illegally reduced
customs and tax liability constitute a type of payment

that can fall within this broad coverage.”

Paying Bribes to Customs Officials

In 2010, a global freight forwarding company and
six of its corporate customers in the oil and gas industry
resolved charges that they paid bribes to customs
officials. The companies bribed customs officials in more
than ten countries in exchange for such benefits as:

 evading customs duties on imported goods

= improperly expediting the importation of goods
and equipment

* extending drilling contracts and lowering tax
assessments

 obtaining false documentation related to
temporary import permits for drilling rigs

enabling the release of drilling rigs and other
equipment from customs officials

In many instances, the improper payments at issue
allowed the company to carry out its existing business,
which fell within the FCPA’s prohibition on corrupt
payments made for the purpose of “retaining” business.
The seven companies paid a total of more than $235
million in civil and criminal sanctions and disgorgement.
