confident. This is a back and forth, a power loop. His
expertise is knowing what other people know. Which
surely offers a unique sense of confidence that it is
possible to understand how the world works. And in a
time of such radical flux and existential instability,
everybody wants to seek out someone who might have
some answers or at least make you feel like he does—
even, and maybe especially, the rich. The fact that he’s
an outsider, even a pariah, nobody you have to fear, in
his own way a secret (and all powerful people like
secrets) is—if you’re not caught in his company—
reassuring too.

In the last days of my interviews with Epstein, he
was called by a particular world-stage individual, indeed
among the richest and most powerful—proudly louche
himself—who, feeling out of his depth in a world of
crashing oil prices and wild currency fluctuation, had
come to believe he might benefit from some private
tutoring. And so the math teacher got on his plane.
