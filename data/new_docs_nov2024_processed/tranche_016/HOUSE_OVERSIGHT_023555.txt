A frog goes into a bank and sits down ina chair next a desk that has a placard on it that
says Seymour Paddywhack, Bank Officer.

He says, I need to borrow some money.

Mr. Paddywhack says, To do that, you'll need some collateral. What have you got?

The frog reaches into his bag, takes out a small plaster statue of Elvis and puts it on the
desk.

Mr. Paddywhack says, Is that all you have?

The frog says, Yeah.

Mr. Paddywhack says, “Well, that won't do.

The frog says, I want to see the president.

Mr. Paddywhack leads the frog into the bank president's office, puts the little Elvis on his
desk and says, This frog wants to borrow some money, the only collateral he has is this statue
and I don't even know what it is.

The bank president says, It's a knick-knack, Paddywhack, give the frog a loan.

He says, * Ello, * ello!
She says, So you're not speakin’ to me, then?
