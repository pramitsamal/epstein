e Japanese Utilities

The impact of the Fukushima incident on Japanese utilities will last for years. Nuclear policy will continue
to be reviewed — notably the decision whether to restart nuclear power plants — which will affect the
utilities’ long-term fuel mix and therefore cost base.

For example, Kansai Electric Power, which has the largest exposure to nuclear generation after Tokyo
Electric, stopped paying dividends after the nuclear shutdown. Every 1% change in its nuclear fleet
utilization rate will affect earning by almost 10% over a normalized level; nuclear policy decisions can thus
create outcomes for share prices of +/- 50%.

The ripples from changing nuclear policy will have a long-lasting impact, both negative and positive, on
companies involved in the nuclear value chain (e.g., reactor manufacturers such as Mitsubishi Heavy) and
other power-related sectors such as gas and renewable energy. Relative to other regions, Japanese
utilities will be the most affected by macro factors (e.g. the Yen, interest rates, fossil fuel prices, etc.).

Below is a partial list of structural changes driving long/short opportunities in Japan:

Electron’s structural changes: Japan

e = Fukushima incident’s impact on Japan’s power-related sectors such as LNG and power equipment
e Derating of sector as a result of the government’s response to Fukushima

e Restart of nuclear plants with Abe administration and prefecture support

e Fuel cost impact from Yen depreciation

e Movement to higher value-added renewable energy systems
