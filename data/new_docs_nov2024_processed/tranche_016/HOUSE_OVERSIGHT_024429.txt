Notice how celebrities basking in their narcissism think they can dictate culture to us while they live their
lives in the comfort of their ivory castles. Mia farrow has no clue what the right to bear arms means and
because of that she needs to shut the hell up. As far as blacks go-- I grew up in the 70's coming home from
Hallahan H.S. in Philadel phia, me and my small group of girls were swarmed by a mob of black girls who
would kick and slap and pull hair without provocation. of course we would fight back but then that was back
in the day when whites weren't sissies. Still I made excuses for them. Black men would get in my face for no
other reason than to intimidate me. rocks were thrown a my car for no reason. So, in short, based on my
experiences Blacks are the cause of racism and if they hate whites so much then they should stay away
completely and totally. _

I read the Control factor and it was excellent. I wish more people would realize that our country is at its most
vulnerable than ever in its history. the jihadis have basically taken over the inner cities. Islam's love for
violence coupled with ignorance and narcissim are a recipe for disaster. I hope Americans wake up in time to
save their future. I'm not optimistic though. I think its over but still I fight on.
