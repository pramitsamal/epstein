FDA Approval of Cannabis-Derived Pharmaceuticals

The FDA’s first-ever approval of a cannabis-derived pharmaceutical may occur in 2018. The FDA
has previously approved several drugs with chemically synthesized cannabinoids or cannabinoid-like
compounds, but has never approved a drug derived from the cannabis plant. In October 2017,
U.K.-based GW Pharmaceuticals submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for Epidio-
lex, an oral formulation of cannabis-derived cannabidiol, or CBD, intended to treat severe forms of
childhood epilepsy. (GW Pharmaceuticals also manufactures Sativex, a mouth spray used for treatment
of spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis; it includes THC and CBD derived from cannabis. Sativex
was first approved for use in the United Kingdom in 2010, and has been approved for use in at least
30 countries, but not in the United States.) If the FDA approves Epidiolex, such a precedent could
be followed by similar approvals in the United States for other cannabis-derived drugs and result in a
significant increase in the medical use of cannabis by consumers.

Commoditization of Cannabis Flower

The supply of cannabis in the United States has increased considerably with expanded state legaliza-
tion. This increase has started to dampen retail and wholesale prices in various markets. While retail
prices vary across the country, an examination of the price per gram of cannabis flower, or “bud,” in
the three largest states to implement recreational laws—Colorado, Oregon and Washington—reveals
a downward trend. The following graph shows the average price per gram of cannabis flower in these
three states since the beginning of 2016.
