Cannabis Plant Anatomy

Cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways that introduce its active compounds into the body:
smoking cannabis flower or its extracts, vaporizing cannabis flower or its extracts, ingesting cannabis
extracts or food products prepared with cannabis and topical application of cannabis products. Human
consumption of cannabinoids and terpenes is widely believed to have numerous medicinal benefits and
therapeutic applications. Depending on the types and relative concentrations of the cannabinoids and
terpenes consumed, these benefits may include pain relief, reduction of inflammation, and promotion
of an energetic, uplifting mood or a calm, relaxed mood.

Although humans have used cannabis therapeutically for thousands of years, only recently have
scientists begun to research and understand at the chemical and biological levels how cannabis works
with the human body. In the 1940s, the American organic chemist Roger Adams performed numerous
studies on cannabis and identified and isolated the cannabinoids THC, CBD and cannabinol, or
CBN. In the 1960s, a team of scientists led by Raphael Mechoulam at the Weizmann Institute of
Science in Israel more completely determined the chemical composition of THC, CBD and certain
other cannabinoids. This research on cannabinoids ultimately led to the discovery that the human
body naturally produces its own cannabinoids and uses them to regulate homeostasis (a process by
which biological systems tend to maintain internal stability, or balance).
