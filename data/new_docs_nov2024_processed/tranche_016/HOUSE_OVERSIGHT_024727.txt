CHAPTER V
Global Cannabis Regulation

= Global Cannabis Legalization Momentum

Cannabis legalization is gaining momentum around the world, offering global opportunities for can-
nabis companies and related businesses. This momentum is driven primarily by the increasing recog-
nition that cannabis may have a range of legitimate medicinal benefits and therapeutic applications.
At least 20 countries now have medical laws that facilitate patient access to cannabis or concentrates
for treating specified medical conditions. Notable countries with such medical laws include Australia,
Canada, Colombia and Germany; countries without such laws include China, Japan, Russia and the
United States. (Contrary to U.S. federal law, 29 states, encompassing 62% of the U.S. population,
permit the production and possession of cannabis or concentrates for use in treating a broad range of
qualifying medical conditions.) While the merits of medical cannabis are currently driving legalization,
we believe that—like Uruguay and numerous U.S. states—other countries will ultimately enact legis-
lation permitting the production, sale and use of recreational cannabis. (Canada is widely expected to
do so in mid-2018.)

The following world map illustrates select countries that (i) have enacted medical laws that facilitate
patient access to cannabis or concentrates for treating specified medical conditions, (ii) have enacted
recreational laws that permit the commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults for recreational
and other uses, or (iii) include a state or province that has a cannabis law or policy in conflict with
federal law.
