COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019

For gummies, we analyzed 30 SKUs across 13 brands. Our analysis shows that CV
Sciences’ CBD Oil Gummies are the most premium priced at an average $0.24 per mg of
CBD. CV Sciences offers two SKUs with their 30 capsule bottle providing 150 mgs of
CBD for $39.95, while their second SKU offers a slightly better value proposition, with a
60 count bottle providing 300 mgs of CBD for $64.95 ($0.22 per mg).

Hemp Bombs had the largest number of SKU’s relative to the other brands analyzed (7),
while also having the highest absolute price point ($139.99 for a 60 gummy bottle with
1,500 mgs of CBD), though the average price per mg of CBD positioned the brand within
the main segment.

Similar to its tincture offering, we would note that Highline falls broadly in the middle of
its peers, as their direct-to-consumer business model allows the company to offer
competitive pricing across its portfolio.

Almost half of the brands analyzed fell into the value segment, all priced at $0.10 per
meg of CBD or lower. Across all 30 SKUs, average retail price was ~$50 per offering, with
an average 450 mgs of CBD offered per bottle.
