- Beauty

The U.S. beauty category, which is inclusive of skin care, cosmetics, haircare, fragrance,
bath & body, salon styling tools, and other toiletries, is a ~$87 bn industry according to
Euromonitor International and IBIS World Inc. Within mass beauty, the prestige segment
grew 6%, accounting for almost $19 bn in revenue in 2018 according to NPD. If we
extrapolate the 6% growth in prestige beauty out through 2020, that would result in
segment revenues surpassing $21 bn over the next two years.

We expect that CBD beauty will become more of a focus for consumers, as large-scale
manufacturers and retailers begin to roll out more products, which will presumably
generate positive mix and result in a step-change in market share capture. As such, we
believe that a ~1% share of the prestige market is achievable in 2019, doubling to 2% in
2020, which would equate to over $400 mm in sales. The below analysis provides a
scenario of revenue outcomes based on share capture, ranging from ~$200 mm to over

$600 mm.
