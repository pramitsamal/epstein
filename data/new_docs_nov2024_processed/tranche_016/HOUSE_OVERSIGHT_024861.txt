COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019

Beauty products, and face treatments in particular, command price points notably
above other form factors across the space, which will presumably offer by far the
highest gross margins. Among high-end face creams, Cannabliss Organic and CTFO
provide 30 mgs and 20 mgs of CBD respectively, while commanding price points ranging
from $50-S80.
