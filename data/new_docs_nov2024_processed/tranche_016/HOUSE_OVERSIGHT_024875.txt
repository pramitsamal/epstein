Nuances around different business models become increasingly apparent when
benchmarking gross margins. Charlotte’s Web and CV Sciences, which we would classify
as finished goods producers, command the highest margins, while Turning Point Brands’

contend with being both vertically integrated and in many instances, servicing retail
stores, which are lower margin.
