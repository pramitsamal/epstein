Turkey to explain and justify its stance towards Israel. Now Turkey
will have to try much harder to promote its position to the world in
the absence of such support. However, this does not necessarily mean
that Turkey's decision to impose sanctions against Israel is wrong.
Any other decision would have meant Turkey was bowing to Israel's
demands.

The report certainly undermined Turkey's position, but overall, things
are not so bad in its aftermath. The policy Turkey has pursued since
the Mavi Marmara incident has served its interests so far. The report
could have sealed the process. The presidential statement made at the
UN Security Council immediately after the incident as well as the UN
Human Rights Council's decision finding the Gaza blockade illegal
and Israel the culprit should be revisited. Turkey expected that this
last UN report would complete the circle and drive Israel into a
corner. But contrary to expectations, the report made some room for
Israel to maneuver and took an opportunity away from Turkey.
