SPIEGEL: So you support the Palestinian initiative?
Elaraby: Support? We are doing everything in our power to back it.
SPIEGEL: The Americans have threatened tough consequences...

Elaraby: That's an unacceptable position for us! The strongest and
richest country in the world is incapable of making a commitment.
Instead, someone from Tel Aviv or Jerusalem is telling them what to
do.

SPIEGEL: Won't this stance lead to tensions between the Arab
League and the United States?

Elaraby: I hope it doesn't come to that. If the Americans had fulfilled
the promises they made many years ago and had forced the Israelis to
engage in serious negotiations, the problem would have been solved
already.

SPIEGEL: The German government has also announced that it will
not support the Palestinians’ plan.

Elaraby: I heard what (German Chancellor) Angela Merkel said. She
cited the Germans' unique responsibility to the Jews. But the
Germans also have a responsibility to the Palestinians.

SPIEGEL: The radical Islamic group Hamas, which controls the
Gaza Strip, also doesn't recognize Israel.

Elaraby: Has Israel recognized Hamas? That sort of thing is based
on reciprocity.

SPIEGEL: But the Islamists in the Gaza Strip are the ones firing
rockets at Israeli cities.
