Elaraby: That shouldn't be happening. It's wrong, and we do say that
to them. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas constantly implores
them to stop condoning the firing of rockets. The fact is that there are
extremists on both sides.

SPIEGEL: Will there ever be another war between an Arab country
and Israel over Palestine?

Elaraby: Completely out of the question.

resign if the pressure becomes unbearable?

Elaraby: Yes, absolutely. It's in my nature. Indeed, I'm not sure that I
can stand it much longer.
