Impact to Current Valuations in Upside and Downside Case

In the sections following we explain in greater detail our
approach to potential Upside/Downside scenarios and the
impact to valuation under potential conversion. The actual
impact is very difficult to quantify given the variety of moving pieces
and the reliance on investors to drive the a re-rating. We have pre-
sented it as a scenario analysis to evaluate conversion on a risk
reward spectrum. Upside/downside scenarios show a positive skew
for companies that have higher earnings contribution from manage-
ment fees vs. more downside skew for companies with more per-

formance fees (less certain re-rating of performance fees).

As the examples herein illustrate, we see significant value in the
re-rating of fee-related earnings that could unlock share value
and result in higher stock prices. We believe these stable and

growing fee earnings can support higher multiples and broader own-

ership of the Alts and be the catalyst for the re-rating (explained in
greater detail in the sections that follow). In both our upside and
downside approaches we look at a Sum-of-the-Parts that values at)
fee-related earnings, 2) balance sheet investments and net cash, 3)
the net accrued carry balance, and&) future value of carry. In both the
current and upside case we use a fully taxed fee-related earnings at
a 24% tax rate and our value for the balance sheet remains

unchanged in both scenarios as well.

However, we make several adjustments to our upside and downside
case to reflect a C-corp structure with full tax rate on all earnings: 1)
Tax the net accrued carry receivable balance at a24%.2) Tax our esti-
mate for average net carry earnings at a full 24% rate. Further, in the
upside case we also adjust the multiple upwards for fee related earn-

ings driven by broader ownership of the stocks, and we conserva-
