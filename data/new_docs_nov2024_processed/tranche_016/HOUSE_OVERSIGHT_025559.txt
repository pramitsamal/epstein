tively adjust upward our multiple on future carried interest earnings
by 2 turns. For Apollo, we see that nearly the entire the increase
in value in the upside case is driven by the expansion of the FRE
multiple from 15x to 22.5x.

2018 Impact: Upside case impact is +13% vs. current price on
average and 3.8x multiple expansion to a fully taxed EPS. In our
upside case scenario, we assume a 22.5x multiple on fee-related earn-
ings in our SOTP. We see favorable risk/reward skew APO.

Downside case impact assumes no multiple expansion of any kind,
and that the stocks trade at their same current P/E, however on
lower, fully taxed EPS. This represents -18% average downside from
current prices. While this is likely an unreasonable outcome this is
the concern among some investors, given that the only certainty in
the analysis is a higher tax drag and lower earnings. We see less favor-
able upside/downside skew for BX and KKR.

Exhibit 8:
On average we see potential for 3.7x turns of multiple expansion on in
our upside case with fully taxed EPS at a 24% effective rate. This could
drive +12% upside on average to current share prices
