3) Bond Yield Approach

Our third approach to coming up with the appropriate multiple
for fee-related earnings is to compare fee revenues to a similar
to a bond with a 10-year duration given the locked-in nature of
committed capital with fees paid on commitments (Par Value) as
opposed to paid on NAV. Importantly, the Alts are increasingly
growing permanent capital or very long duration capital that has
attractive life-time value of the contract. APO has the largest
amount of permanent capital, representing about 43% of AUM,
followed by ARES at 16%. This results in a stable stream of reve-
nues, however there could be variability on the expenses that would
impact fee related earnings. Under the bond approach the default
risk in this scenario would be counter party risk that management
fees would not be paid by limited partners. These LPs include sover-
eign wealth funds, pensions, and other institutional investors that we

view as highly unlikely to default.

Our methodology starts with the 10-year US treasury yield, given
the similar duration to the life of the draw down funds management
fees. We then add an appropriate credit spread on top of the 10-year
yield to account for the risk that these institutions miss payment of
their management fees. We also consider the fact that not all fee
paying assets under management at the alts are subject to lock ups
(such as hedge fund AUM, open ended funds). Those alts with larger
amounts of permanent capital or longer duration of assets would
suggest a Lower credit spread given less risk of lost revenues in our

view.

NORTH AMERICA INSIGHT ~~

We look at AA and BBB credit spreads as a proxy for high and low
default risk for LPs paying management fees. AA credit spreads
are currently at 53bps and BBBare currently at 122bps. Again, the risk
of default is likely overstated by using these yields but we show this
range to account for other factors including differences in duration
of assets. We then add these spreads to the current 10 yr treasury
yield of 2.62% to get a yield of 3.15% and 3.84% respectively. Lastly,
we capitalize these yields to back into implied FRE multiples by
taking 1 divided by each of the yields. This implies a multiple of 31.7x
using AA spread and 26.0x using BBB spread. Finally we take an
average of the two credit spread approaches to get to 28.9x.

and we see 63% on average with a contractual life of 7+ years
