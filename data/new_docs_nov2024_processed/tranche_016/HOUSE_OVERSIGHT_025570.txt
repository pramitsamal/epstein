Downside Scenario

Our downside scenario is fairly straightforward: We assume that
alts convert to C-corps and pay full taxes on earnings but the cur-
rent p/e multiple does not re-rate upward at all. We assume the
stocks trade at their current P/E, but on lower, fully taxed earnings.
Therefore, our downside case for share prices is the same percentage
downside to EPS if alts earnings are fully taxed. While we do not
believe there is a high probability of this happening, this does
represent a worst case scenario for the names, in our view. On
average we see 18% potential downside for the group if this were to
happen. We then usea similar approach to deconstruct the SOTP and

see what the value for performance fees would be.

e First, we determine the downside case share price by taking
fully taxed 2018e EPS (at 24%) and multiplying by the current
2018e P/E (the current P/E using our published EPS and cur-
rent partnership tax structure).

® Inthe SOTP, we assume that fee-related earnings multiples
do not re-rate at all in the downside scenario and that the
market continues to pay 15x. We believe there is a floor here

in FRE will maintain current value.

© Similar to the upside case, we then fully tax effect the per-

formance fee earnings and use a full 24% tax drag on the net
accrued carry receivable balance and the future net carry per
share.

We then subtract out the value of the FRE, net accrued carry
performance fees (tax adjusted) and the balance sheet value
from our downside case derived share price. This gives us our
downside case implied value of future carry.

Finally, we divide that implied future carry value by our
fully taxed performance fee earnings (@24%) to arrive at
our downside case implied value of future carry. On
average, our downside case implied future value of carry mul-
tiple is 5.6x, nearly 3 standard deviations away Goldman
Sachs FY2 P/E.
