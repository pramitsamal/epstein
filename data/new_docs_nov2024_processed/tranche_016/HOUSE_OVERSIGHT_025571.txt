Appendix A: Company Scenario Analysis

In the following tables, we flex the inputs in our SOTP
valuation methodology to take a look at the potential
impact at varying fee related earnings multiples and
multiples on future carry. We use the same assumptions
that we used in our upside scenario above, including a fully
taxed (@24%) net carry receivable value as well as using a
multiple on after tax net carry per share for future perform-
ance fees.

For fee-related earnings, we use constant multiples for all com-
panies. We begin with 12.5x, a slight discount to where the traditional
asset managers trade today, and end at 30x, or closer to our bond

yield cap rate multiple approach.

On performance fees, we set the mid point at our estimate for the
current market implied multiple on performance fees (using a 15x
FRE as our starting point), as explained in our valuation methodology

above.
