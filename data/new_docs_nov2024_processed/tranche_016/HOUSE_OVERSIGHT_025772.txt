Harvard professors Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz argue that, rather than technology picking up speed, the
reduced supply of educated workers is the key factor explaining the education gap, finding that between 1980 and
2005 the pace of the increase in educational attainment slowed dramatically. In 1980, Americans age 30 years or older
had 4.7 years more schooling on average than Americans in 1930--but Americans in 2005 had only 0.8 years more
schooling on average than Americans in 1980 (24). Based on this data, it would appear the problem isn't that

technology has leaped ahead--rather, the supply of educated workers has stalled.

The impact of income inequality on future generations of qualified workers is particularly disconcerting. Michael
Greenstone, Adam Looney, Jeremy Patashnik, and Muxin Yu (Hamilton Project-Brookings) examined the effect that
the income divide in the U.S. could have on the future upward mobility of the country's children (25). They found that
investments in education and skills, traits that increasingly decide job market success, are becoming more stratified by

family income, threatening the earning potential of the youngest Americans.

These researchers note that, although cognitive tests of ability show little difference between children of high- and
low-income parents in the first years of their lives, large and persistent differences start to appear before kindergarten
and widen throughout high school (26). Indeed, researchers have found that the gap in test results of children from

families at the 90th income percentile versus children of families at the 10th percentile has grown by about 40% over
