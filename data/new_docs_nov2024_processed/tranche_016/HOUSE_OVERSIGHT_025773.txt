Economic Research: How Increasing Income Inequality Is Dampening U.S. Economic Growth, And Possible Ways
To Change The Tide

the past 30 years (27).

Not surprisingly, these differences persist into college and beyond. While there is a 45% chance that a child born into a
poor family will remain there as an adult, chances of staying poor drops to 16% if that child finishes college (see chart
4). A child born into the bottom 20% will only have a 5% chance of reaching the top 20% of income earners as adults.

But that increases to 19% if they earn a college degree.

However, college graduation rates have stagnated for low-income students, in sharp contrast with strong gains for
wealthy students. While college graduation rates increased by about 4 percentage points between those born in the
early 1960s and those born in the early 1980s for the poorest households, the graduation rate for the wealthiest
households increased by almost 20 percentage points over the same period (28). These trends likely feed into the
income potential for kids as they grew older, with children of well-off families much more likely to stay well-off and the

children of poor families disproportionately likely to remain poor.

Given that education--particularly a college degree--is so important in a jobs market that increasingly demands a more
educated workforce, these trends are disturbing. The findings suggest that last generation's inequalities will extend into

the next generation, with diminished opportunities for upward social mobility. Moreover, the U.S. is losing the
