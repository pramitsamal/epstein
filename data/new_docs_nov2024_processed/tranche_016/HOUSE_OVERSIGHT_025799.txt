leave the union. The US should help Turkey and Baghdad resovlve their issues.
Portraying Turkey as a model and Iraq as a bad guy is counter productive. Turkey
is trying to undermine Shia role in Iraq.

JS: External forces will affect Iraq. We need to keep incentives for all parties to
keep country together.

MO: Iraq is most vulnerable to Iran when it is weak and divided and we haven’t
done enough to help Iraq. Iraqi’s are worried that an Assad exit will push Iran to
double down on Iraq.

JS: limit Iran’s influence on Iraq by isolating Iran in region. Reducing Iran’s
incluence in region 1s key. But Iraq also has to get its act together and be more
cohesive. President has made a big bet on Erdogan and Turkey.

Scowcroft: What are Turkey’s objectives in Iraq?

Steinberg: Kurd separation is their focus. Building a relationship with Iraqi Kurds
is aroute for Turkey. They don’t like NAM and Shia — sunni split plays a role in
Turkey’s attitude towards Iraq.

MO: Turkey sees Iraq and Iraqi Kurds as a source of energy. Turkey doesn’t
necessarily like the idea of an indep. Kurdish state. Also comments that there are
limits to Iran’s influence in Iraq. Sadr is becoming an Iraqi nationalist. He wants to
get rid of NAM. Fluid political dynamics in Iraq. Iran cannot determine outcomes
in Iraq.
