have episodes of more benign model-driven deleveraging. In each quadrant exists
examples of simultaneously increasing equity and bond volatility (that is, high absolute
equity and bond daily returns). However, in the first and third quadrant, equity and bond
moves are in the same direction, which would likely be an example of increasing
correlation. On the other hand, in the second and fourth quadrant equity and bond
moves are in opposite directions and hence correlation is subject to a decrease. The
main takeaway here is the most risk of model driven deleveraging from vol controlled
risk parity funds comes when Both volatility and correlation of the underlying
components rise together.
