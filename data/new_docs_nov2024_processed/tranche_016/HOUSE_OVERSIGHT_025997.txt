Rationale

Investors should re-assess attractiveness of popular and (typically) technically
motivated longer-dated RV vol trades, given environment of structurally higher
political & economic risks and increasingly limited policy options

FTSE 3M 25d put vol near 7hr highs vs. vol on EFA

Continuous Southbound inflow benefit financials sector and narrow AH premium

Hedge further Brexit fallout, Italian bank & referendum risk
Cheaply construct risk-limited “uber-barbell” portfolio
Low-cost macro hedge for US equity portfolios

Add exposure via inexpensive upside on single names where positioning appears
particularly bearish and stocks have underperformed vs. their sectors

To hedge potential earning downside surprise

To hedge potential earnings upside surprises

Our analysts expect positive and impactful catalysts in Q3-2016; recent strong
performance and depressed short dated implied vol favor stock replacement via
calls to reduce downside risk, maintain upside and lock in profits

Position for accelerated upside returns ahead of closing the Rite Aid acquisition
Cheap hedge against a bond tantrum
Cheap equity upside in a bond / equity melt-up

Record outperformance of Utilities vs. Financials + FMS positioning + central bank
catalysts = potential for cyclicals / defensives mean reversion
SX7E 1M 25d call / SX5E 1M 25d call price ratio is in the 100‘ 2-yr percentile

Sell VIX Oct puts to leverage likely floor in vol ahead of US elections and cheapen
shallow hedges
Short-term bullish China trade with term structure at its steepest in 4yrs

Rationale
Take profit as the hurdle to surprise on the upside is high following a 5.8% NKY rally

Take profit as Facebook rallied on better-than expected Q2 results
Take profit as Amazon rallied on better-than expected Q2 results
Remove protection as worries around disappointing Q4 guidance faded post earnings

The BoJ, Fed & EU bank stress tests could move mkts sharply in the near term

Unwinding before the Aug16 expiry; The NKY Sep put spread has carried well
