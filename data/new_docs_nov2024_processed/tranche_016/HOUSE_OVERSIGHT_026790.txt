In the meantime, each person needs to remain resilient and relevant. The structure of government moves slowly,
and it took decades of incremental moves for the reactionary right to gain the power it presently holds tight. If
the midterm elections don't restore sanity, then collective consciousness is more wounded than we imagine.
Without a doubt Trumpism is horrifying, but the grievances it represents are real. Address those grievances

honestly and with a clear conscience: that's the only remedy.

4 easy ways to squeeze meditation into a busy da

By Deepak Chopra and Kabir Sehgal, Contributors

There is no doubt that you can benefit from daily meditation. It has several health benefits like reducing cortisol
levels that cause stress, lessening blood pressure, and slowing the heart rate. Besides these physiological effects,
it can also have a positive impact on your work life, by increasing your attention span, deepening your focusing,
catalyzing your creativity, and making you a better listener.

Given all these constructive outcomes, meditation should become an integral and required part of your day. But
finding the time to actually engage in this practice can be difficult, so here are a few ways you can incorporate
mindfulness exercises into your day.

First, a morning ritual

When you wake up, you're already in a quiet room in which you feel relaxed. This might be the last time you're
surrounded by silence, so take five minutes and practice breathing in and out. Notice the sound of your breath as
you inhale and exhale. Imagine the air rushing into your mouth and filling your lungs, and then picture it
leaving your body and filling the room.
