Housing reform: 2015 be the year of GSE reform?

- After initial movement on bi-partisan legislation last year, this is a dead effort as indicated by
Banking Committee member and advocate for GSE reform, Senator Bob Corker (R-TN): “Congress
will ignore GSE overhaul for next 16 months.”

- Meanwhile, the housing market is moving on a number of fronts (we’ve seen this horror movie
before):

v¥ Fannie Mae launched their “HomeReady Mortgage” program: You can (again) use the income
from non-borrower household members.

v¥ Freddie and Fannie are working on a common Securitization Platform. Just for them (for now)
but will eventually allow other participants. Question as to whether this is a transition to
something new or simply securing the monopoly/duopoly of the GSE’s.
