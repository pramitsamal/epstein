e The universal horror at what happened in Paris is likely to strengthen the determination of countries
gathered in Vienna for the Syria conference to better coordinate and prosecute the campaign against ISIS in

Syria and Ira.

Bottom Line: Has risk to the United States increased? There are no indications yet that ISIS has changed its
approach here. It encourages radicalization and lone wolf attacks but has not mounted direct attacks. But the
Metrojet bombing has resulted in a stepped up global effort to secure American airlines. So too, targeting of
American institutions/events — it is unlikely a coincidence that an American band was playing at the site of the largest
causalities in Paris -- seems highly probable. This applies equally to American bases and facilities overseas, including

embassies.
