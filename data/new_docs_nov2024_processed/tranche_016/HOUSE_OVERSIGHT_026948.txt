“The United States is [sending] a message to the Iranian
regime that any attack on US interests or on those of our allies
will be met with unrelenting force. The US is not seeking war
with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond
to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary

Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.”

— NSA John Bolton announcing the deployment of a carrier
strike group to the Persian Gulf, May 5, 2019

“Our aim is not war. Our aim is a change in the behavior of the

Iranian leadership.”
— Secretary of State Pompeo, May 12, 2019

“President Trump has sought to put the brakes on a brewing
confrontation with Iran in recent days, telling the acting
defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, that he does not want to
go to war with Iran, administration officials said, while his
senior diplomats began searching for ways to defuse the

tensions.”

— New York Times, May 16, 2019

“The Fake News Media is hurting our Country with its
fraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of Iran. It is
scattershot, poorly sourced (made up), and DANGEROUS. At
least Iran doesn’t know what to think, which at this point may

very well be a good thing!”
— President Trump, May 17, 2019

“Will the president let himself be pushed into a parlous war by John Bolton, who once buoyed the phony case on WMDs 1n Iraq?”
— Maureen Dowd, New York Times, May 18, 2019
