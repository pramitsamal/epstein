The immediate threat of military engagement between the US and Iran has eased but risk of escalation
or miscalculation is high.

US agenda (and the impact of Saudi Arabia and Israel) is unclear, with administration officials offering
contradictory views.

Iran is set to resume its nuclear program with the intent of gaining leverage for future negotiations
which it previously relinquished as part of the JCPOA.

There is further potential downside for Iranian oil production and exports, but ample OECD
inventories, growing US production, and OPEC spare capacity would help contain any short-term oil
price shock.

We continue to recommend that clients stay invested at their full strategic asset allocation given
today’s macroeconomic backdrop and low odds of a recession, but we remain vigilant about the risks
to our outlook.
