will uncompromisingly support Israel's right to preserve and develop its indigenous military
capacities.

4. Israel will accept an American invitation to attend a peace conference that will be convened
in the U.S. no later than mid-2013. This gathering will address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
aiming to resolve it once and for all with an agreed-upon timetable for implementation.

These four commitments would serve the interests of both the United States and Israel. They
would enable the U.S. to resume its leadership role of peacemaking in the Middle East. And they
would provide a basis for binding the U.S. and Israel together as they face these challenging
times.

Ephraim Sneh, a retired IDF General, served as Israel's deputy minister of defense. He is
currently and Israel Policy Forum contributing fellow and chairman of S. Daniel Abraham
Center for Strategic Dialogue at the Netanya Academic College.
