An Assassination in Tunisia
Editorial

February 8, 2013 -- Tunisia is where the Arab Spring began just over two
years ago. Until now it has set an encouraging example of progress toward
democracy and pluralism. Free elections brought to power a coalition
government pledged to pragmatic cooperation between a moderate-led
Islamist party, Ennahda, and smaller, secular coalition partners.

Progress has not always been smooth. But just as Tunisians inspired
people in neighboring countries like Egypt and Libya to rise up against
their corrupt and repressive dictators, they also seemed, for many, to point
the way toward a democratic future accommodating both religious beliefs
and the rights of the secular under the rule of law.

Those hopes have been severely shaken by the murder on Wednesday of
Chokri Belaid. Mr. Belaid, a human- rights activist and one of Ennahda’s
most outspoken critics, had publicly challenged the party’s failure to
investigate or prosecute violent acts of intimidation carried out by
shadowy gangs of religious extremists. Mr. Belaid’s killers have not yet
been identified. But suspicion now falls on those same extremist groups,
which had issued public threats against Mr. Belaid and other prominent
secular leaders — without any serious government response.

Thousands gathered for Mr. Belaid’s funeral on Friday amid a nationwide
general strike called by his trade union supporters. Tensions are high.
What is urgently needed is a credible, independent investigation of Mr.
Belaid’s murder, followed by prosecution of the killers.

Given Ennahda’s record of selectively ignoring Islamist violence, that
investigation cannot be left to its appointees alone. A preferable
alternative would be to reconstitute the broad-based, multiparty
commissions that successfully oversaw Tunisia’s free elections in October
2011 and investigated the crimes of the fallen dictatorship.
