Hi.. so, here is the event I am still invited to give in Germany. It is Oct 19th. I was previously invited to give
a major lecture in Heidelberg Oct 14 but they had to cancel it after the university determination re australia
was publicized by the bitch. That air ticket, which they had paid fo, was about 5250 euros. There is a $900
cancellation fee, and they have agreed to let me keep the ticket if I pay them 4500 euros. I offered that to the
other place but they only have $5K USD total, which includes the $4K fee they originally offered me. I am
going to check other tickets now, but wanted to know if you might be flying to europe around then and could
take a hitchhiker. :)

Hi Lawrence,

just back from a long tour ,,on origins”.

As promised you will get my message promptly.

As you may understand, before we start recruiting for the Festival our budget
implies more freedom. Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily
on amounts in ,,kilos“. (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before
deadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum).

What I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment.

I deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines.

So please let me know if you can or cannot come.

As ever Jakob
