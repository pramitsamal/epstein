They are not part of the problem.

¢ Ben Gurion used to say, with
his iron logic, that the future of Israel
depends on our strength and our
righteousness.

Our strength — that is the IDF's might
and its strategic capabilities, the backing
of the superpowers, our economic
strength, and our social solidarity.

Our righteousness — not as an abstract
concept — 1s our capacity to hold
themoral high ground by means of a
calculated effort to behave and be
perceived as acting 1n good faith — to
obtain peace, even if it delays.

¢ This is also an an essential
condition for achieving internal
solidarity and the world's support for
Israel (or for the support of most of the
world that's important to us).
