Dear Sir or Madam,

I ama reporter and editor for The National Enquirer. | request records under the provisions
of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.§ 552.

Request

The Enquirer seeks all documents relating to the FBI’s investigation and prosecution of
financier Jeffrey Edward Epstein, who pled guilty to one count of felony solicitation of
prostitution in August 2006.

Background

Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire financier, philanthropist, and sex offender. In 2005, Epstein
became the subject of an undercover sex trafficking investigation by Palm Beach, Florida
police and the FBI. Dozens of underage women claimed that they had been trafficked by
Epstein to perform sexual acts on him as well as his friends.

Many prominent political figures have been connected to Mr. Epstein’s child-trafficking
ring, including former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the British Royal
Family.

Despite the gravity of his offenses, the Department of Justice agreed to allow Epstein to
plead guilty to a single count of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl under Florida
state law, and served only 13 months in prison. In addition, prosecutors agreed not to bring
charges against Epstein’s alleged co-conspirators.
