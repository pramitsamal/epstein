The poem I'm hoping you would read is one that we discussed, William Carlos Williams’s iconic poem

“This Is Just to Say.” The poem is copied below. There are, naturally, commentaries on it I could share,

if you wanted to read some, but you seem to have already thought about it quite a bit.

This Is Just to Say

I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox

and which

you were probably
saving

for breakfast

Forgive me

they were delicious
so sweet

and so cold

Logistically, we are at your service. I would be happy to film you when I visit New York on October

24th. Or, I would love it if you would come visit Larry and me in Boston with Jeffrey. We could show

you and Soon Yi around Harvard, eat a big bowl of plums, and talk poetry. I would introduce you on

camera and you'd read, or recite, and we'd perhaps talk about the poem for a moment.

Thank you very much for considering this proposal. I admire you immensely and would feel honored to

bring you into this project.

Best,
Lisa New
