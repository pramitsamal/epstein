But this will all be for naught without
better governance, argues Gurcharan Das,
the former C.E.O. of Procter & Gamble
India, whose latest book is “India Grows
at Night: A Liberal Case for a Strong
State.” “The aspirational India has no one
to vote for, because no one is talking the
language of public goods. Why should it
take us 15 years to get justice in the
courts or 12 years to build a road? The
gap between [youth] aspirations and
government performance is huge. My
thesis is that India has risen despite the
state. It is a story of public failure and
private success.”

That is what Das means by India grows at
night, when government sleeps. “But
India must learn to grow during the day,”
he said. “If India fixes its governance
before China fixes its politics that 1s who
will win. ... You need a strong state and a
strong society, so the society can hold the
state accountable. India will only get a
strong state when the best of society join
the government, and China will only get
a strong society when the best Mandarins
go into the private sector.”
