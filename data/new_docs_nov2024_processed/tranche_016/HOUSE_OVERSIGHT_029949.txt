Turkey may be attempting to reassert its influence in the Middle East
by defying US pressure. But it remains a loyal member of Nato and
continues to press for membership in the EU. In fact, notwithstanding
Turkey's regional ambitions, it has proved to be ineffective in trying
to bring to an end the political upheaval and violence in neighbouring
Syria. At the same time, despite its lessening influence in the Middle
East, the US and its Nato and EU partners continue to play an active
role in trying to provide support to its allies and bring some stability
to the Middle East.

And while Asean members are strengthening their economic ties with
the rising Chinese giant - as are Japan, South Korea, Australia and
India - they also support continuing strong US military and economic
presence in East Asia as part of an effort to counter-balance Chinese
efforts to establish its dominant position in the region.

In a way, even as emerging markets are gaining more economic clout
and the international system is becoming multipolar, it is not clear
that that is creating the conditions for the West versus the Rest
confrontation or that the US or the EU is being marginalised. In the
new global economy and international system with its many centres
of power, interlocking trade and investment ties, and shifting
balances of power, a wise and effective leadership coming out of
Washington could help actually turn the US once again into a central
and indispensable power.
