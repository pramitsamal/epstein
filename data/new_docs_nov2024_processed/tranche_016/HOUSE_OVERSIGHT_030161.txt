But today, in Amman, as in almost every Arab capital, independent
meetings and debates about how to move forward are taking place in
art galleries, think tanks, salons, ordinary households, and, most
significantly, online. A region often depicted as “backward” is
debating its destiny both face-to-face and across social networks
every second of every day.

Yet tweeting is no substitute for thought. Indeed, the events and
personalities that have so far gained attention seem to fill the void
where the declarations of freedom and treatises on rights — where
the ideas — should be.

The result is the confusion that we now see. Contradictions abound.
Governments across the region have been identified as the problem,
and yet the state is being called upon to address a social and political
agenda that has not yet been fully defined. We are seeing the birth of
a more democratic spirit among the region’s peoples, but a
corresponding sense of democratic responsibility remains
underdeveloped.

No matter how influential new media have been, they cannot replace
the need for a region-wide “manifesto for change” that all who seek
freedom can embrace. Any such manifesto must address the two
elephants in the room — Palestine and the price of oil — as well as the
extent to which regional water and energy resources, now rapidly
depleting, should be shared. (Here, I and experts from around the
world have been calling for the creation of a Supranational
Commission for Water and Energy to ensure the kind of sustainable
resource management that the Strategic Foresight Group has labeled
“Blue Peace.”’)

Of course, generating ideas is easier said than done. By limiting free
speech and forcing millions of young people to stay at home without
jobs, the only public space left for many people happens to be virtual.
Arab governments switched their people off, so their people migrated
