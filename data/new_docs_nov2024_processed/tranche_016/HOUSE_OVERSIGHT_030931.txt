Months later he has totally forgotten about the innocuous E-mail. Based on the merits, he happens to
rank Y's bid number one. _ |

You can bet as sure as J. Edgar Hoover wore pink poodle skirts, the FBI will conclude this was code
from Commissioner X to Walton to vote for Y. .

Armed with the E-mail you can be damn sure that the G-Men will be back threatening him with
everything including a stint in Gitmo.

All af this might have been avoided if he had followed my three basic rules.
CA
1. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer.
2. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer.

3. Do not talk to the FBI without a law
