The women accusing Donald Trump of sexual assault

She says that since Trump launched his campaign and received mass media coverage, she has been

“subjected to daily painful reminders of the horrific acts.”
A similar lawsuit by the woman was dismissed by a Los Angeles Federal Court in May.

Alan Garten, vice president and general counsel of the Trump Organization, has said the allegations were

preyed on dozens of underage girls in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but pleaded guilty to soliciting a
minor in just one case in 2008.
