I understand your frustrations and appreciate your willingness to figure out a solution. I have some ideas
which I will send you over the weekend if that is OK.

Re Broadcom: _ the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been
a lot of focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we
hear from management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger.

This morning the pricing is as follows:

Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10
Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90

Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept
puts. However I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management before
August expiry.
