Palestinians or with Syria in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians
have taken themselves out of the game for now. We cannot turn from
them to the Syrians while Assad’s troops are using howitzers and
sniper rifles against his people. This is the time not for diplomatic
engagement with Assad, but for diplomacy aimed at quarantining his
regime and helping bring it down. The White House should dismiss
any remaining dreams of a “peace process” with Syria to substitute
for the Palestinian version and face facts: There will be no peace with
the butcher who rules Syria today.
