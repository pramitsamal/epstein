Obama has also disappointed some liberal supporters by resuming
military trials of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo.

Environment: Despite his stated support for environmental
legislation and green energy, there has been little progress on passing
major climate-change bills under Obama's watch. Thanks largely to

Copenhagen climate summit, but in failing to impose enforceable
emissions targets, the meeting was widely considered a failure. This
