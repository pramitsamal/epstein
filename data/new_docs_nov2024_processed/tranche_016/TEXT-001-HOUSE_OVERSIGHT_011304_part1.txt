                                                                 2

     H3VOGIU1



 1            (Case called)



 2            THE COURT:  Like all of you, you woke up in the middle



 3   of the night thinking about this case.  I would like to see if



 4   I can clarify my understanding.



 5            In the motion to dismiss, I concluded, I think, that



 6   what was at issue was the truth or falsity of the plaintiff's



 7   allegations concerning sexual abuse and the activities of the



 8   defendant.  I think that's my sense of my own opinion.



 9            Yesterday, we were discussing the redactions of the



10   intervention motion.  I got the sense, perhaps wrongly, that



11   the plaintiff's position was that the defamation was the truth



12   or falsity of the statements relating to the defendant.



13   Period.  Am I correct?



14            MS. McCAWLEY:  You are, your Honor, in that the



15   statements about the defendant -- to be clear, because one of



16   the allegations is, of course, she was a madam and a



17   coconspirator with Epstein -- do involve Epstein.



18            THE COURT:  Listen.  Leave the pejorative out.  Okay?



19   Please.



20            MS. McCAWLEY:  Sure.



21            THE COURT:  Simply because I'm trying to come to



22   grips, obviously, with the scope of this case, which is a real



23   issue, obviously.  So is it you are restricting your claim to



24   the truth and falsity of the statements about Maxwell?



25            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, that is the case, your Honor.  The



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                                 3

     H3VOGIU1



 1   statements about Maxwell and her activities, without using any



 2   description of what that is, but yes, as we've described in our



 3   pleadings.



 4            THE COURT:  And whether or not the plaintiff was



 5   subject to sexual abuse as a minor is not part of it.  I mean,



 6   yes, of course, whatever she was when whatever, but that issue



 7   we don't have to deal with.



 8            MS. McCAWLEY:  I'm sorry, your Honor.  I think I lost



 9   you there.  I apologize.



10            So the allegations in the complaint are that when our



11   client came forward and said she was abused by the defendant



12   and Epstein, the defendant came out and said she was lying



13   about that abuse, and some of that abuse did occur when she was



14   a minor.



15            THE COURT:  Yes.  Well, okay.  But there are other



16   things that she sets forth in the Churcher articles, in the



17   motion to intervene, there are a whole series of other things



18   that are -- I mean, there are things that have been said, and



19   my reading of the defendant's statement is, I read it to say



20   all those things are false.  But those are not at issue, as far



21   as you're concerned.



22            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.  In fact, the omnibus



23   motion we filed today -- and I think, if I'm following you



24   correctly, this may help -- we were trying to streamline the



25   case because there's other individuals, obviously, that my



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                                 4

     H3VOGIU1



 1   client made statements about.  So we were trying to streamline



 2   the case to the statements about Maxwell and her involvement



 3   with Epstein.



 4            So in the omnibus motion you'll see, for example, that



 5   they have claimed she's made statements about other



 6   individuals, and we say that that's not what's at issue, what's



 7   at issue are the statements --



 8            THE COURT:  That may be an issue of credibility.  That



 9   may be an issue of credibility.  I'm talking about what we're



10   going to go to the jury on.



11            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.  And that is the statements that



12   Maxwell made about my client.



13            THE COURT:  And that's it.



14            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor.



15            THE COURT:  Let me ask the defense.  Does that clarify



16   anything for you?



17            MS. MENNINGER:  Could I have one second, your Honor?



18            THE COURT:  Sure.  Of course.



19            MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, I think it's slightly more



20   nuanced.  Plaintiff has claimed our client's statement is



21   false.  Our client's statement is not just limited to the



22   little snippets that they included in their complaint, it's the



23   entire statement.  That entire statement talks about Virginia



24   Giuffre's allegations against Ms. Maxwell have been proven



25   untrue.



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                                 5

     H3VOGIU1



 1            THE COURT:  Yes.  But the statement wasn't limited to



 2   those allegations.



 3            MS. MENNINGER:  That's exactly right, your Honor,



 4   because right in the middle of that particular statement, the



 5   one that's at issue in this case, our client said, Now her



 6   story has grown and evolved, and she's included allegations



 7   about world leaders and Alan Dershowitz, which he denies.  We



 8   can't just take that part out of her statement, that's what



 9   Ms. Maxwell put in her statement.



10            And your Honor, what we will ultimately be hearing



11   from Ms. Maxwell about what she believed were the obvious lies



12   that she was referring to and the allegations that she was



13   referring to when she issued that statement.



14            THE COURT:  Now, one other question, and then we'll



15   get to the business of the day.  I apologize for this



16   diversion.



17            Let me ask you both.  Suppose the plaintiff proves



18   that she was sexually abused and that her story is



19   substantially true but she does not prove the role that Maxwell



20   had.  Does she win?



21            MS. MENNINGER:  No, she loses, your Honor.



22            THE COURT:  I think she wins.



23            MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, the very first --



24            THE COURT:  Other than what you've just said.



25            MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, our client can only be



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                                 6

     H3VOGIU1



 1   alleged to have defamed someone based on facts, not opinions.



 2            THE COURT:  Agreed.  Agreed.



 3            MS. MENNINGER:  And so she can -- the Davis v. Boeheim



 4   case is a perfect example of that, your Honor.  She can only



 5   speak to facts about which she has personal knowledge.  If



 6   plaintiff goes and proves that plaintiff went and had sex with



 7   Jeffrey Epstein at some point in time and our client wasn't



 8   there, our client's statement about that would be opinion, it



 9   would not be a fact based on personal knowledge.



10            THE COURT:  I mean, okay.  But that's an issue of



11   knowledge.  That's a different --



12            MS. MENNINGER:  You just said --



13            THE COURT:  That's a different --



14            MS. MENNINGER:  The hypothetical was if our client



15   wasn't involved.  If our client wasn't involved then it would



16   be an opinion.



17            THE COURT:  Thanks very much.  I'm glad for this



18   clarity, which frankly, at the moment, alludes me.



19            Okay, let's move on.  Yes, I'll hear from the movant.



20            MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.



21            The first order of business we'd like to address, if



22   it's okay with the Court, is our filing, which was 691, which



23   is our omnibus motion in limine.  And if it's okay with the



24   Court, we've split that up a bit.  I'm going to start with



25   respect to that motion in limine.



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                                 7

     H3VOGIU1



 1            What we attempted to do with our motion in limine was



 2   streamline the trial.  And your Honor, based on the comments



 3   you've just made, if you want to give me guidance, I'll tell



 4   you what I'm thinking with respect to this and what we put



 5   forth in our filing.



 6            But there are statements that are attributed to my



 7   client in other articles and things.  For example, there are



 8   statements about Bill Clinton being on the island, and the



 9   defense wants to bring in those statements to show that -- they



10   believe they can show evidence that he wasn't on the island, so



11   therefore, my client is a liar or is lying about that.



12            Now, your Honor will remember, back in June we sought



13   to depose him because we were concerned about that fact, that



14   they were going to raise it, and we wanted to have him under



15   oath --



16            THE COURT:  Let's back up a little bit.



17            MS. McCAWLEY:  Sure.



18            THE COURT:  What and where was the statement made?



19            MS. McCAWLEY:  The statement was made in a March 5th



20   article.  So not the two articles we showed you yesterday --



21            THE COURT:  The Churcher article.



22            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.  But it was another article that



23   came out in March of 2011.



24            And the statement was with respect to my client saying



25   she saw him on Epstein's island.  She was introduced to him



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                                 8

     H3VOGIU1



 1   there.  Although no allegations of trafficking or anything of



 2   that nature, just that she was there.  And they are seeking to



 3   introduce evidence through Louie Freeh, who we'll discuss in a



 4   moment, they've proposed, and he's clearly an expert that was



 5   undisclosed, and through a FOIA record, and through the



 6   articles to allege that he wasn't on the island.



 7            And so in your Honor's order in 264-1, which is one of



 8   the sealed orders, you did not allow us to depose him because



 9   you said it was irrelevant.



10            So we're now in a position where at trial they want to



11   put forth that information against my client, and I don't have



12   an under-oath statement from that individual saying whether or



13   not he actually was.



14            Now, what we know is he flew with Jeffrey Epstein at



15   the same time 19 different times internationally and



16   nationally, but we don't have him with respect to this



17   particular allegation under oath.  So we would say it would be



18   highly prejudicial for them to be able introduce evidence



19   saying that he wasn't there or that they have some proof or



20   some expert saying he wasn't there when, in fact, we weren't



21   able to ask him directly, the person who is at issue, under



22   oath, whether or not he did, in fact, go there.



23            So one of the streamlining of this case is that



24   allegation has nothing to do with sexual abuse, it doesn't have



25   to do with the statements --

     H3VOGIU1



 1            THE COURT:  It has to do with credibility.



 2            MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, your Honor, I would say, if



 3   you're inclined to think that that has --



 4            THE COURT:  Well, look.  I'm no genius.  I don't claim



 5   any -- but you know, that is precisely what the defense is



 6   going to say.



 7            MS. McCAWLEY:  Right.  I understand, your Honor.  And



 8   that's why we sought to depose him because it's inherently



 9   unfair --



10            THE COURT:  Okay.  So you would say I made a mistake.



11            MS. McCAWLEY:  No, your Honor.  I think it should be



12   excluded, and in my view, I think it's not relevant to the



13   issue at trial here.  But they are, of course, going to argue



14   that it is and that they want to bring that in.  In fact, like



15   I said, they've got lined up Mr. --



16            THE COURT:  Well, on the question of credibility, why



17   isn't it relevant?



18            MS. McCAWLEY:  Because the statement -- so this case



19   is about whether or not she was sexually abused and



20   trafficked --



21            THE COURT:  Now, that's where I started out.  Is it



22   about that?  If that is your position, that's something else.



23   If it's a question about her sexual abuse, in addition to, then



24   that's something else.  But you just said it isn't about that,



25   it's just about Maxwell and did she tell the truth about

 1   Maxwell.



 2            Well, I suppose, I suppose -- I haven't heard the



 3   other side and I haven't really thought it all out -- but I



 4   suppose if she is untruthful in other instances, that may be



 5   relevant to her credibility.



 6            MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, your Honor, if that's the Court's



 7   position, again, we would be in a circumstance -- I mean,



 8   there's a couple reasons why the evidence itself that they want



 9   to put forth doesn't come in.



10            THE COURT:  Well, that's a different thing.



11            MS. McCAWLEY:  Sure.  That's part of our motion, as



12   well, your Honor.



13            THE COURT:  Sure.  I read that.  I understand that.



14            MS. McCAWLEY:  Right.  So on the same note, since



15   we're talking about this, I'll just tick off the few that fall



16   within this category, if you don't mind.  I understand, your



17   Honor's position, so --



18            THE COURT:  Well, I'm not sure what my position is



19   right now.



20            MS. McCAWLEY:  Okay.  So with respect to -- there's



21   another category where there's been statements where my client



22   said that she was trafficked to foreign presidents and world



23   leaders that they want to bring into evidence.  And in order to



24   streamline the case, we've said, well, there's none of those



25   people on the witness list, and just statements in an article



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                                11

     H3VOGIU1



 1   of that nature shouldn't be able to come in.  Because when we



 2   talk about a character issue, what's at issue here is



 3   reputation, and reputation to show the truthfulness of that



 4   would not be able to be proven in that circumstance because we



 5   don't have the other individuals there to make that statement,



 6   so there's no substantive evidence on that point that would be



 7   coming in.



 8            And the third category is with respect to



 9   Mr. Dershowitz, who is on the defendant's witness list for



10   trial, and we have a few points there to raise.  I mean, one is



11   obviously that if that were allowed to come in, that causes the



12   trial to become a mini trial about whether or not he, for



13   example, was in the places where she says he was, his



14   calendars, his credit card receipts, his telephone records, all



15   of that.  It gets into the issue, you know, obviously we have



16   another witness who says that they were in a similar



17   circumstance with respect to him.  So it takes the trial away



18   from whether or not the allegations relating to Maxwell are



19   true or false and turns it into a trial about another



20   individual who we have not made a claim against who comes in.



21            There's also a problem with respect to that because he



22   is also -- he has claimed attorney/client privilege as to his



23   conversations and his advice with respect to Epstein which



24   relates to the issues with Maxwell.  So in other words, he



25   would be able to testify what he says he didn't do, but then



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3VOGIU1



 1   any questions we wanted to ask him about Epstein or Maxwell he



 2   says he's got an attorney/client privilege.  So we're hand-tied



 3   because we can't ask about the issues that we need to ask about



 4   with respect to that witness.  So in my view, it's highly



 5   prejudicial to have him as a witness at trial when, again, our



 6   claims are not against him, and we have those issues.



 7            Now, you did have -- in your February 2nd order, you



 8   also precluded us from asking questions that we contended were



 9   non-Fifth Amendment questions of Jeffrey Epstein about



10   Dershowitz, holding that those were not relevant.  So we're in



11   a situation where we have another witness that we are not able



12   to elicit all of the information we need to be able to prove



13   the truth or falsity of that, and again, it would be subject to



14   a number of mini trials on that issue of Mr. Dershowitz.



15            So with respect to those three categories -- and it



16   also allows them to use the attorney/client privilege as a



17   sword and a shield in the midst of a trial, which is inherently



18   unfair to my client, as well.



19            So in our view, it's highly prejudicial under 403.



20   Those groupings should not come in.  It should not be about,



21   for example, Clinton and whether or not he was on an island, or



22   Mr. Dershowitz or these other world leaders, it should be about



23   the defendant and her statements that my client was lying when



24   she claimed to be abused and trafficked in those statements.



25            THE COURT:  Just a second.

 1            MS. McCAWLEY:  Sure.



 2            THE COURT:  What you just said, could you repeat what



 3   you just said?



 4            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.  So the statements that



 5   Ms. Maxwell denied were statements that my client made that



 6   defendant and Epstein trafficked her, brought her in, had her



 7   participate in the sexual abuse of her and other females, she



 8   was in that circumstance, she lived that circumstance for a



 9   period of time, and so Maxwell came out and called my client a



10   liar, said she was lying about those statements that she made,



11   and said that, obviously, as you know, to the international



12   press about my client and what her experience was with them.



13            So with respect to that, your Honor, those are the



14   categories that we believe would help streamline the case, and



15   again, that those witnesses would be highly prejudicial.



16            On the issue of the information that they'd like to



17   put in with respect to Mr. Clinton, they have Louie Freeh who



18   they've identified.  This is a former FBI director.



19            THE COURT:  I know.



20            MS. McCAWLEY:  You know, yes.  So they've put him in



21   without giving us a Rule 26 expert report.  He was never



22   disclosed during the time period.  His report or what he's



23   going to say, as we understand it, is that he's reviewed the



24   FOIA response and that there's no evidence in his view that



25   Clinton was on this island, again, even though he flew

 1   regularly with Mr. Epstein to other places.



 2            So again, we didn't get to depose him as an expert in



 3   this matter.  We didn't know that he was going to be called as



 4   an expert.  They're saying he's a lay opinion because he's a



 5   private investigator, your Honor.  The case law says otherwise.



 6   He's been certified as an expert in these exact kind of cases.



 7   We put those in our brief.  So your Honor, he is really a wolf



 8   in sheep's clothing.  They're trying to put him on as a lay



 9   opinion when he's really an expert witness in this case with



10   sufficient and sophisticated knowledge, that the jury will



11   recognize him as someone who has expertise in this area so,



12   your Honor, we believe he should be precluded from testifying.



13   He has no personal knowledge, it's simply his reliance, as we



14   understand it, on the one FOIA response letter.



15            So your Honor, with respect to the FOIA response



16   letter that's at issue that they are going to try to get into



17   evidence, we've put forth in our papers, again, that's a



18   hearsay document.  It's highly prejudicial under 403.  They say



19   that it meets self-authentication, but unlike the documents



20   that we showed, for example the 302 that have the seal on it,



21   it has none of those qualifications.



22            They cite to two cases, the Zamara case and the Gary



23   case.  Both of those involve getting into evidence underlying



24   records that were produced by the government, not a FOIA



25   letter.  So what they're trying to produce is a letter that



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3VOGIU1



 1   says we've looked and we can't find these records that you've



 2   requested.



 3            Now, it doesn't address the fact that the government



 4   only typically retains records for a few years when they were



 5   requesting records from 15 years ago, so it doesn't have the



 6   indicia of trustworthiness to be able to say that this is



 7   actually the fact because, of course, as we know, the



 8   government regularly has to get rid of records.



 9            So to use this letter to say, 'Ah-hah, he was never on



10   the island,' when we never got to examine him under oath and



11   say, 'You traveled with him a bunch.  Did you also go to the



12   island?  My client says she met you there.'  We didn't get to



13   ask those questions, so we're in a situation now where that



14   letter coming in would be highly prejudicial because the jury



15   will wonder, well, what does he have to say about this?  And we



16   haven't been in a position to be able to do that.



17            So your Honor, for all those reasons we believe that



18   Mr. Freeh should be excluded, the FOIA letter should not come



19   into evidence, and again, we believe that the issue of



20   Mr. Clinton should not be an issue relevant to this trial.



21            Next, your Honor, they also seek to include



22   statements, hearsay statements and newspaper articles about



23   Prince Andrew, and it's actually not his denial, as I



24   understand it, Buckingham Palace's denial of the allegation of



25   my client.  But again, Prince Andrew is not on the witness

     H3VOGIU1



 1   list, we're not able to cross examine him, so what they want to



 2   do is introduce triple hearsay of Buckingham Palace saying what



 3   Prince Andrews said in a news article without the reporter



 4   against my client without our ability to cross examine him on



 5   that.



 6            So your Honor, they've tried to argue a little bit of



 7   a securitous way, I think that it's a verbal act on behalf of



 8   Prince Andrew, it doesn't meet that criteria, there's been no



 9   statement by -- there's been no action by my client against



10   him, and what's at issue in this case is, again, Maxwell's



11   statements against my client.



12            The case that they cite actually, the Minemyer case,



13   goes against them.  It actually talks about how you would have



14   to call the reporter, that that couldn't come into evidence.



15   And so, your Honor, for those reasons, we believe that, again,



16   that's a distraction, it's highly prejudicial to allow a triple



17   hearsay document like that to come in without our ability to be



18   able to cross examine that individual.  So for those reasons,



19   your Honor, we believe that that should not come in.



20            They also made an argument that it's somehow an



21   intervening cause or that, you know, it goes to the issue of



22   she should be seeking damages from Prince Andrew, things of



23   that nature.  But as we know, because your Honor reviewed the



24   case law with respect to the summary judgment, each individual



25   is responsible for their own defamation, so it doesn't come

 1   into consideration whether she could have sued six people for



 2   it, 20 other people for it, this case is about Maxwell and her



 3   defamation against my client.



 4            So again, your Honor, if you look at Sack on



 5   Defamation, it addresses that directly, and we believe that



 6   that should not come into evidence.



 7            So your Honor, that's the first chunk of the omnibus



 8   motion that I was addressing.  I'm not sure how you want to



 9   take it, if you want to have opposing counsel speak on those



10   issues now and then move to the others, or if you want us to



11   keep moving through it?



12            THE COURT:  What's your preference?



13            MS. McCAWLEY:  I think keep moving through it would be



14   great.



15            THE COURT:  What?



16            MS. McCAWLEY:  To keep moving it through it, if that's



17   all right, so we can get through argument and then have them



18   address it?



19            THE COURT:  Sure.



20            MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.



21            MS. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, this is Meredith Schultz for



22   the plaintiff.  The next article in the omnibus motion is to



23   exclude testimony references to prior sexual assault.  This is



24   an issue that I spoke on yesterday related to another motion



25   regarding the same, so I'll keep it brief.



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3VOGIU1



 1            But prior sexual assault, all of which occurred while



 2   Ms. Giuffre was a child, it's irrelevant to this action.  It



 3   doesn't come in under 401.  It doesn't involve defendant.  It



 4   predates even meeting defendant.  And these assaults do not



 5   make it more or less probable that defendant defamed



 6   Ms. Giuffre, and neither does it tend to prove or disprove that



 7   defendant abused her.



 8            These are also classic examples of evidence that



 9   should be excluded under Rule 412.  The Rape Shield Law forbids



10   evidence concerning these unrelated events involving



11   Ms. Giuffre.  This rule should be strictly enforced,



12   particularly because these events happened when she was 14 and



13   15 years old.  Rule 412(a) bars this evidence if it's offered



14   to prove that she engaged in any type of sexual behavior to



15   prove any type of disposition.



16            It should also be excluded under Rule 403.  This is



17   extremely prejudicial, and because it is irrelevant, it would



18   only encourage the jury to view Ms. Giuffre, a married mother



19   in her 30s, as an immoral person for having sexual contact with



20   individuals as a child.



21            This should also be excluded under 608(a), which



22   limits interaction of evidence for specific instances of



23   conduct in order to attack the witness' character for



24   truthfulness.  Now, I spoke about this at length yesterday.



25   Defendant tries to offer two particular things to say that, oh,

 1   she wasn't truthful about something, about being sexually



 2   assaulted, but the documents themselves describe something



 3   that's unequivocally sexual assault under Florida law,



 4   something that is unequivocally nonconsensual.  So that would



 5   honestly be another mini trial and would take us far afield of



 6   what facts are relevant to this case.



 7            And again, any minor probative value that's past



 8   sexual assault that Ms. Giuffre experienced as a child is



 9   completely swallowed by the prejudicial effect on the jury.



10            MR. CASSELL:  Your Honor, I think I'm the next one up.



11   For purposes of clarity, we're up to point number 7 in our



12   omnibus motion.



13            This one I think is just a very simple and



14   straightforward one.  We move to exclude derogatory sexual



15   characterizations.  This is a case that your Honor has been



16   framing this morning.  It doesn't require use of a term from



17   defense counsel, for example, describing our client as a



18   prostitute or as a slut.  We thought we would get agreement



19   when we saw the responsive papers from the defense, but as you



20   know, they objected in it's entirety to this motion, so we're



21   here asking that defense counsel not refer to our client as a



22   prostitute, not refer to her as a slut, and they also advise



23   their witnesses that such language would be inappropriate in a



24   federal trial dealing with a defamation issue.



25            On this particular point about prostitute, it's



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3VOGIU1



 1   interesting.  Am I conjuring up something that's not going to



 2   happen?  No, your Honor.  The defendant's own expert report



 3   described our client as a prostitute.  Your Honor has under



 4   advisement the expert report from Dr. Esplin, and so I deposed



 5   Dr. Esplin, and I said, Are you sure that's an accurate term



 6   in the context of this case?  Because we have a child who



 7   cannot consent to sexual activities.  And he backed off



 8   immediately and agreed that that was an inaccurate term for him



 9   to use to describe my client, Ms. Giuffre.  So even the



10   defense's own expert says the term prostitute is



11   inappropriate.



12            Your Honor has authority, of course, under Rule 611 to



13   manage the trial, to avoid undue harassment or embarrassment.



14   Also Rule 403 allows you to restrict things that would be



15   substantially prejudicial with no probative value, which is



16   exactly what we have here.  So we would ask you simply to reign



17   in derogatory language, both from witnesses and opposing



18   counsel.



19            MS. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, I'll be addressing the next



20   several points in the omnibus motion, starting with number 8.



21   I think I can narrow this issue a little bit at the outset.



22            Ms. Giuffre concedes here that illegal or



23   nonprescription use of drugs during the years that she was with



24   defendant is admissible.  However, any evidence pertaining to



25   any use of drugs, illegal or not, and alcohol from any periods

     H3VOGIU1



 1   before or after Ms. Giuffre was abused by defendant is



 2   irrelevant to this action and should be excluded under Rule



 3   401.



 4            It is also, of course, highly prejudicial and should



 5   be excluded under Rule 403.  Whether or not Ms. Giuffre ever



 6   used drugs while not being abused by defendant does not go to



 7   any claim or defenses in this case.



 8            Courts in the Southern District of New York routinely



 9   exclude evidence of prior drug use under both of these rules,



10   as fully briefed in the papers.  Defendant attempts to admit



11   this evidence of prescription drug use related to damages,



12   specifically whether or not the emotional distress Ms. Giuffre



13   suffered is preexisting.



14            THE COURT:  And why do you have it in your expert's



15   report?



16            MS. SCHULTZ:  Well, our expert is -- I'm assuming



17   you're referring to Dr. Kliman, who is a physician.  He's a



18   medical doctor.  He took a full --



19            THE COURT:  There's a whole thing about it.  Are you



20   going to withdraw the --



21            MS. SCHULTZ:  No, your Honor.  We're only claiming



22   damages with respect to the emotional distress suffered from



23   the defamation.  And also, taking drugs prescribed for various



24   mental health issues is not the same thing as emotional



25   distress.  They're two different issues.  So any marginal

 1   probative value is outweighed by the prejudice.  Again, this is



 2   only seeking damages based on defendant's defamation.



 3            I'm going to move on to point number 9.  Ms. Giuffre



 4   seeks to exclude any alleged criminal history from coming into



 5   this case.  And the Federal Rules of Evidence bar the



 6   introduction of this evidence, full stop.



 7            As the Court is aware, the only way criminal history



 8   could come into evidence is through Rule 609, but that rule



 9   itself bars this evidence because, one, there's no conviction,



10   and two, the alleged crime does not go to truthfulness.



11            Of the two parties, your Honor, Ms. Giuffre is the



12   only one who has not been convicted of a crime here, this is



13   merely an alleged prior bad act which is excluded under Rule



14   404.



15            And this alleged act, which Ms. Giuffre denies, does



16   not go to truthfulness, and that's an important point here.  An



17   accusation of a crime with no conviction does not go to



18   truthfulness, especially a crime like this, which specifically



19   is defendant says she stole from a tip jar when she was a



20   teenager.  Knowing that this type of evidence is excluded,



21   counsel for defendant has put forth an unsupported argument



22   that Ms. Giuffre left the United States because of allegations



23   that she stole from a tip jar.  That is, of course, false.  She



24   left the United States to get away from defendant's abuse.



25            And moreover, the documentary evidence in this case,



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

 1   which has been produced in discovery and submitted to this



 2   Court, shows that it was defendant who sent her to Thailand,



 3   sending her with handwritten instructions about what to do when



 4   she gets there.  So if this unsupported argument that defendant



 5   left the United States because of some accusation of a tip jar



 6   is to be believed, then that makes defendant an accessory after



 7   the fact and implicates her in the wrongdoing.



 8            So I don't -- basically, there's just -- this argument



 9   is also undone by the fact that later, Ms. Giuffre comes back



10   to the United States to live here.  She's not fleeing



11   accusations, she was fleeing defendant.  If she were worried



12   about criminal liability in the United States, she wouldn't



13   come back to live here.



14            But the overall point is any marginal probative value



15   from these allegations, which I don't think there is any, but



16   it's far vastly outweighed by the prejudice it would cause



17   Ms. Giuffre and should be excluded under all those rules.



18            Moving now to point 10.  Ms. Giuffre has requested



19   that the Court exclude any evidence regarding special



20   schooling, truancy, and juvenile delinquencies.  For this



21   argument, your Honor, I request that I approach the bench and



22   give you a few documents upon which these arguments are based.



23   I have four documents that I'm handing up.



24            I have to get a little bit into the weeds here, so



25   please bear with me.  In this case, Ms. Giuffre -- well, school

 1   records have been part of discovery.  They show a history of



 2   rampant truancy and failed courses.  This constitutes prior bad



 3   acts which are excluded under Rule 404, particularly since



 4   these bad acts do not go to truthfulness, so they're also



 5   excluded under Rule 608.



 6            They should also be excluded because their prejudice



 7   that it would cause Ms. Giuffre greatly outweighs any probative



 8   value and should be excluded under 403.



 9            There's a huge remoteness issue here, your Honor.



10   These truancies and juvenile delinquencies took place many



11   years ago when she was a minor.  There's a lot of case law on



12   this that is in Mr. Giuffre's brief on page 22 to 23.  But what



13   you should be aware of, your Honor, is that a close examination



14   of records, looking up what the number codes on these



15   transcripts actually mean, it shows the opposite of the



16   argument that defendant advances in her response brief; that



17   she was in school, and therefore, not abused by her client.



18            To the contrary, the records show that she was not in



19   school over half the time she was supposed to be and did not



20   complete her courses.  These transcripts are not



21   self-explanatory.  Indeed, looking at the face of them, it



22   seems like she was enrolled and attending school, but much of



23   the information in these records are number codes used by the



24   Palm Beach County School District.  These school records could



25   not be placed into evidence for all the reasons above, but if

 1   you are inclined to do them, you could not place them into



 2   evidence fairly without testimony regarding what all these



 3   codes on the transcripts mean, or at a bare minimum, the



 4   introduction of evidence and instruction that makes explicit



 5   what all the codes on the transcripts mean.



 6            Defendant either failed to do her due diligence on



 7   this and looked at what the codes are before advancing this



 8   argument, but either way, it's not a good faith argument



 9   because, as you can see in the document I handed up, these



10   codes and their meanings were detailed at length in



11   Ms. Giuffre's opposition to the motion for summary judgment,



12   and I would ask the Court to refer to the facts at page 32 of



13   the statement of facts.



14            So what the records actually show is rampant truancy,



15   years of absence from school while defendant was abusing her,



16   which show ample opportunity for abuse, and are, in fact, in



17   accord with the flight records, which have also been produced



18   in this case, which place Ms. Giuffre on 23 flights with



19   defendant aboard Jeffrey Epstein's private plane.



20            So as these records actually show truancy, failed



21   grades, failure to complete courses, these should be excluded



22   under all the rules I cited earlier, or at a bare minimum,



23   instruction to the jury about what the codes mean and detailing



24   how many days of school Ms. Giuffre actually attended, a number



25   that is conspicuously absent from defendant's brief.

 1            Turning next to plaintiff's motion in limine number



 2   11.  This is a related issue.  We ask that the Court exclude



 3   characterizations of Ms. Giuffre's bad behavior during her



 4   childhood, including characterizations of her as a bad child or



 5   a runaway.  Defendant's response to this tries to conflate two



 6   separate things; prior bad acts, an assault on her character on



 7   one hand, with a reputation for truthfulness of another.



 8            Prior bad acts she may have committed as a child, like



 9   running away, is inadmissible and a defamation action where the



10   damages relate to her reputation.  That she ran away from home



11   or was an ill-behaved child does not go to truthfulness.



12            These events also do not go to her reputation.  Her



13   reputation for truthfulness as an adult prior to the defamation



14   is the only reputation that's at issue in this case.



15   Defendant's defamatory statements damaged Ms. Giuffre's



16   reputation when she was in her 30s.  This does not open the



17   door into evidence of Ms. Giuffre's generalized character,



18   particularly one from a troubled childhood.  Occurrences, such



19   as running away from her home when she was a child, are simply



20   prior bad acts under Rule 404 that should be excluded.  They



21   should also be excluded under Rule 405 because this is



22   introduction of evidence to try to show her character.  And



23   Rule 608(a) also limits evidence and testimony about a witness'



24   reputation for having a character for truthfulness or



25   untruthfulness, it doesn't come in under that rule.

     H3VOGIU1



 1            Her reputation for truthfulness does not go to any bad



 2   acts she may have committed 20 years ago.  And your Honor, even



 3   criminal convictions are generally not admissible 10 years



 4   after the fact.  So presentation of this type of evidence is



 5   simply nothing more than a smear campaign, which is prescribed



 6   by multiple Federal Rules of Evidence.



 7            And finally, any marginal probative value of these bad



 8   acts as a child is vastly outweighed by the undue prejudice it



 9   would cause Ms. Giuffre before a jury.



10            Your Honor, now I'm turning to point number 12.  We've



11   asked the Court to exclude evidence relating to the tax



12   compliance of Ms. Giuffre's not-for-profit Victims Refuse



13   Silence.  Rule 401 is the first rule under which this should be



14   excluded.  The alleged tax compliance of her not-for-profit



15   does not go to whether or not defendant defamed Ms. Giuffre and



16   does not go to whether or not defendant abused Ms. Giuffre.



17            It should also be excluded under 403.  It is highly



18   prejudicial.  It would give the wrong impression to the jury



19   that Ms. Giuffre's organization is not tax compliant, which, in



20   fact, it is a fact that defendant does not acknowledge in her



21   briefing.



22            Proving whether or not Ms. Giuffre's not-for-profit is



23   tax compliant would also be a mini trial and, frankly, a



24   sideshow to this case.



25            Furthermore, all of defendant's conclusions about



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3VOGIU1



 1   Ms. Giuffre's not-for-profit tax compliance are based on an



 2   errant report by her purported expert, an expert who should be



 3   excluded from testifying because his report lacked methodology



 4   and he opined on topics far afield from his expertise.



 5            Second, any allegations that her not-for-profit is not



 6   tax compliant is prejudicial, misleading, confusing to the jury



 7   because it has nothing to do with the claim at issue in this



 8   case.



 9            Your Honor, we asked for defendant's tax returns in



10   this case.  If they go to truthfulness, as defendant argues,



11   they also go to defendant's truthfulness.  At this point, we're



12   not going to get them until the first day of trial, so we will



13   not be able to effectively cross examine defendant on those tax



14   returns, and we won't be able to see until then if she's paid



15   taxes on all the money and gifts and in-kind payments from



16   Epstein that she's received or has kept that away from the



17   government.  Unlike Ms. Giuffre's tax information, defendant's



18   tax information goes to our case in chief and is relevant



19   evidence.



20            On point number 13, we move to exclude evidence



21   relating to Ms. Giuffre's alleged tax compliance.  Your Honor,



22   this is a defamation action where reputation is at issue.  Tax



23   compliance does not go to a reputation, it is a private matter.



24            Second, there is no evidence in this case that any



25   government, either United States or Australia, believes that



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

 1   she is noncompliant with her taxes.  Defendant's purported



 2   expert's evaluation of this is wholly flawed, as explained in



 3   Ms. Giuffre's motion in limine on the same.



 4            Similarly, Ms. Giuffre's taxes are wholly irrelevant



 5   to this case.  Even actions brought by the government, your



 6   Honor, where the cause of action is centered on nontax



 7   compliance exclude evidence of prior tax noncompliance when it



 8   takes the case too far afield of the issue being tried.



 9            Courts also exclude this evidence under 403 if there's



10   no substantial nexus between the alleged tax noncompliance and



11   the matter at hand.  Here, defendant fails to show any type of



12   substantial nexus to this defamation claim.  None whatsoever.



13            Additionally, resolving Ms. Giuffre's tax compliance,



14   this is a point that's in dispute among the parties, and



15   resolving such an issue would also involve another mini trial



16   where Ms. Giuffre would put on evidence of her tax compliance



17   and, at the end of that mini trial, the jury would have no more



18   information whether or not defendant defamed Ms. Giuffre when



19   she called her a liar about being sexually abused.  Trying to



20   make this an issue, this is simply a device for putting the



21   settlement agreement and the amount between Ms. Giuffre and



22   Jeffrey Epstein into evidence.



23            As has been briefed extensively, such a settlement



24   payment is tax exempt under the United States law, but that's



25   all this is, it's a device to try to get an improper admission

 1   of a settlement amount between Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein.



 2   Accordingly, this should be completely excluded because any



 3   marginal probative value this has on the claims is greatly



 4   outweighed by the prejudice to Ms. Giuffre.



 5            I am not up for the next one, so I'm going to take a



 6   break.  Thank you.



 7            MR. CASSELL:  Again, your Honor, I'm up to number 14



 8   now, the issue of Ms. Giuffre's being a victim of domestic



 9   violence.  This is not relevant or minimally relevant.  It's



10   Ms. Giuffre's burden, of course, to show the emotional distress



11   damages that she suffered as a result of Ms. Maxwell's



12   defamatory statement, and the jury can agree or disagree with



13   whether she's carried her burden of proof.



14            If we understand the defendant's argument correctly,



15   they say, well, this would have been a distressing event in



16   your life and, therefore, we should be free to introduce it in



17   front of the jury.  Of course, that argument would allow, if



18   accepted, essentially any bad thing that's happened in any



19   plaintiff's life to be introduced if they seek emotional



20   distress damages because, my goodness, this event here or there



21   had some emotionally distressing effect on you.  So it has



22   minimal to low probative value, and the prejudice is very



23   substantial.



24            Your Honor, obviously, has a great deal of experience



25   and are well aware of the domestic violence, blame the victim



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3VOGIU1



 1   attitude that has to be confronted in various cases.



 2   Frequently, if there's domestic violence that's at issue, an



 3   expert witness comes in to explain to the jury, oh, why didn't



 4   she leave?  Why did she stay with this fellow who was beating



 5   her up?  She was free to walk out of the relationship.  Why



 6   didn't she do so?  And there is a whole literature that I know



 7   your Honor is familiar with and that we cited in our brief, as



 8   well.



 9            We don't want to get into that in front of the jury in



10   this particular case.  This is a blame the victim tactic that



11   shouldn't be allowed.  This has very marginal, if any,



12   probative value and a very significant prejudicial effect



13   because the jury will potentially blame the victim for staying



14   with her abusive spouse.



15            Now, in addition, you'll notice from the pleading that



16   the defendants aren't intent just on asking questions about



17   this, but they also want to go into the whole criminal case



18   against Ms. Giuffre's husband, you know, whether he appeared or



19   what the felony charges are and a variety of things.  That,



20   obviously, has even less probative value than the information I



21   was discussing a moment ago and should be independently



22   excluded.



23            The next issue up is item 15.  And here, we ask to



24   have excluded any suggestions that sex with a 17-year-old is



25   permissible.  You will recall that there's debate about exactly

 1   what years and what birthdays were in play and exactly what



 2   Ms. Giuffre said about whether she was 15, 16, or 17.  Fair



 3   enough.  They can cross examine her about, 'Did you say 16 when



 4   you were, in fact, 17,' or whatever it is.  We're not trying to



 5   exclude that.



 6            The limited point that we're trying to address here is



 7   that they shouldn't say, 'Ah-hah, she was 17, therefore, she's



 8   fair game.'



 9            Under Florida law that we've cited in our pleadings,



10   there is no possibility of a child under the age of 18



11   consenting to sexual activities of the nature that are at issue



12   here, and therefore, the defendant should be precluded from



13   making that kind of suggestion.  And so that's item 15.



14            MS. SCHULTZ:  Turning to item 16 in the omnibus



15   motion.  Ms. Giuffre has moved the Court to exclude medical



16   records.  Here, I would actually like to direct the Court's



17   attention to defendant's response.  Defendant here does not



18   cite a single case where a court allowed admission of unrelated



19   and irrelevant medical records into evidence at trial.



20            Defendant's brief also doesn't show how any medical



21   records are relevant here, and there are privacy issues at



22   stake.  In fact, defendant does not cite to a single case in



23   which a court allows any medical records into evidence.



24            In defendant's entire response she cites two cases



25   only.  Neither of them have anything to do with what documents

 1   might be admitted at trial.  Both are orders resolving



 2   discovery disputes under Rule 26.



 3            Apart from her medical records, while defendant was



 4   abusing her, such as when defendant took her to a hospital here



 5   in New York when she was only 17, and the psychological records



 6   related to Ms. Giuffre, which have been produced, which



 7   incidentally are from 2011 and name defendant as her abuser, no



 8   other medical records are relevant and should be excluded under



 9   Rule 401.



10            Ms. Giuffre is seeking damages for emotional distress



11   from defamation.  It does not open up the flood gates to every



12   single medical issue she's ever had in her life.  Ms. Giuffre



13   has produced records, everything from treatment for a ferret



14   bite to details of her giving birth.  These are not relevant,



15   and we can have a ruling in advance of trial that these things



16   should be excluded.



17            Defendant only seeks to use these records to confuse



18   the issues before the jury.  Defendant offers no reason for



19   addressing the relevance of such documents one by one at trial,



20   and I think these can be safely excluded at this juncture.



21            MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, next is number 17, which we



22   addressed in our papers, as well, about the prior settlement



23   agreement.  You've heard about it in this case, and we have



24   said that that should not come into evidence.

 1   amount has something that the jury should consider.  Your



 2   Honor, the papers set forth very clearly that there's a



 3   specific rule of evidence directly on point with respect to



 4   settlement agreements, and they can't be used in that manner.



 5            Your Honor, we cite to our papers on that with respect



 6   to any prior settlement agreement being entered into evidence



 7   at the trial.



 8            MR. CASSELL:  I believe I have the next three.



 9            Item 18 then is defamation litigation.  And your Honor



10   is aware that there was a separate lawsuit that's spun out of



11   this situation where Cassell and Edwards filed a defamation



12   action in Florida State Court against Alan Dershowitz.  Alan



13   Dershowitz then counterclaimed.  That was litigated in Florida



14   State Court for about a year.  Ultimately, the parties settled



15   their differences in an undisclosed financial arrangements and,



16   as part of the comprehensive settlement, Cassell and Edwards



17   then withdraw summary judgment against Dershowitz.



18            It was as expressly understood when the parties agreed



19   upon this confidential settlement, there was then a statement



20   in which it was said that Ms. Giuffre reaffirms her



21   allegations, and the withdrawal of the reference to the filings



22   is not intended to be and should not be construed as being an



23   acknowledgment by Edwards and Cassell that the allegations made



24   by Ms. Giuffre were mistaken.



25            There was a portion of the statement that talked about



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

 1   mistake, and that was indicated in the pleading withdrawing



 2   the summary judgment motion as follows:  Edwards and Cassell



 3   do acknowledge that the public filing in the Crime Victims



 4   Rights Act case of the client's allegations against Defendant



 5   Dershowitz became a major distraction from the merits of the



 6   well-founded Crime Victims Rights Act case by causing delay



 7   and, as a consequence, turned out to be a tactical mistake.



 8   Tactical mistake.  For that reason Edwards and Cassell have



 9   chosen to withdraw the referenced filing as a condition of the



10   settlement.



11            That's all a very interesting lawsuit, but that's a



12   lawsuit that does not have Ms. Giuffre as a party.  It was



13   Cassell and Edwards versus Alan Dershowitz, with claims going



14   back and forth.  Cassell and Edwards were, of course,



15   vindicating their own professional interests and their



16   professional reputation responding to the attacks that had been



17   made by Mr. Dershowitz, and they chose to settle the case, as



18   did Mr. Dershowitz, for undisclosed financial reasons.



19            And also, from the fact I think your Honor is now



20   aware, that there were some witnesses who were not available.



21   Sarah Ransome has come forward in this case to say that she was



22   a traffic to Alan Dershowitz in the same way that Ms. Giuffre



23   alleges, and that was information that has only recently become



24   available.



25            The point is, you have enough business on your hands

 1   without getting into the details of another separate lawsuit



 2   that did not involve Ms. Giuffre as a party, and so we've moved



 3   in limine.



 4            And let me make clear that I emphasize the narrowness



 5   of our motion here.  We seek to preclude evidence involving



 6   that litigation.  Your Honor has already heard from my



 7   colleague, Ms. McCawley, who has presented our argument for why



 8   Dershowitz should not be in this case at all, and of course, if



 9   we prevail on point 1, this point becomes irrelevant.



10            But in addition to point 1, we don't need to be



11   getting into the details of the separate lawsuit.  It's not



12   relevant to the case of Giuffre versus Maxwell.  Defendants, in



13   their responsive brief, if I understand correctly what they say



14   is, oh, well look.  Why didn't Ms. Giuffre join the lawsuit or



15   why hasn't she filed a lawsuit against Dershowitz?  What's



16   going on there?



17            Well, of course, your Honor is aware, there are a



18   variety of statutes of limitation around the country, and



19   indeed around the world.  Ms. Giuffre has not -- those statutes



20   have not all run at this point.  There are varying



21   considerations that go into whether or not someone like



22   Ms. Giuffre would file a lawsuit, and these issues shouldn't be



23   discussed in front of the jury.  That's nothing to do with this



24   particular lawsuit.



25            Moreover, defendant apparently argues that statements



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

 1   that Edwards and Cassell made in this other lawsuit are somehow



 2   binding on Ms. Giuffre.  Edwards and Cassell had separate legal



 3   counsel, Florida attorney Jack Scarola.  Whatever was going on



 4   in that case isn't binding on Ms. Giuffre.



 5            Under the relevant rules, an attorney's statements are



 6   binding on a client only on a matter within the scope of the



 7   relationship.  And this was vindicating separate professional



 8   interests, this was not vindicating some interest of



 9   Ms. Giuffre.



10            So for all those reasons, we ask that the defamation



11   litigation between Dershowitz and Edwards and Cassell be



12   excluded.  Of course, you have the separate issue of Dershowitz



13   in front of you already.



14            Let me turn then to point number 19.  Here again, we



15   have a narrow issue presented to your Honor.  We are asking



16   that you exclude Judge Marra's ruling on the joinder motion.



17   As your Honor is well aware, the triggering event in this case



18   was when Ms. Giuffre, then known as Jane Doe Number 3, filed a



19   motion to join Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 in the Florida pro



20   bono Crime Victims Rights action.



21            Now, Judge Marra denied that motion to join, but at



22   the same time he said, The reason I'm denying the motion to



23   join is you can participate in the case in other ways without



24   being a formal party.  He cited, and I quote, Of course, Jane



25   Doe 3 can participate in this litigated effort to vindicate the

 1   rights of similarly situated victims --



 2            THE COURT:  I'm familiar with it.



 3            MR. CASSELL:  Okay.  Right.  So that's Judge Marra's



 4   ruling.



 5            And you understand that was obviously on a technical



 6   joinder issue.  The joinder issue, whether that was a



 7   good joinder motion or a bad motion, has nothing to do with



 8   whether or not Ms. Giuffre was defamed.



 9            THE COURT:  How do you propose to handle the joinder



10   motion evidentially?



11            MR. CASSELL:  Right.  We think the joinder motion



12   should simply come into evidence as the pleading to which



13   Ms. Giuffre -- I'm sorry -- Ms. Maxwell was responding.



14            THE COURT:  Lock, stock, and barrel?



15            MR. CASSELL:  So we are obviously waiting for guidance



16   from your Honor.  For example, if you say, look, Dershowitz,



17   let's just not get into that, that's --



18            THE COURT:  That didn't answer my question.  Please.



19            MR. CASSELL:  I apologize.



20            THE COURT:  You talk about many trials, many



21   arguments.  You want to put in the entire motion?



22            MR. CASSELL:  Yes, unless your Honor -- I want to be



23   direct here.



24            Yes.  However, if you say, look, Dershowitz isn't



25   coming into this case, there are some allegations about

 1   Dershowitz that we would then believe, in light of your ruling,



 2   should be redacted.  But until we have any rulings from your



 3   Honor restricting the case, it's our position that all --



 4            THE COURT:  But you don't have an edited version of



 5   the intervention motion that you would like me to consider.



 6            MR. CASSELL:  We would propose one once we get rulings



 7   from your Honor on the motions in limine.



 8            THE COURT:  By the way, just parenthetically, folks,



 9   these motions in limine are good fun, and we're all having a



10   nice time, but they're not binding.  I mean by that, I'm



11   expressing my view, or I will, I hope, some day express my view



12   on these issues, but the trial may turn in a different



13   direction and, you know, who knows.  Okay.



14            MR. CASSELL:  We understand.  And one of the reasons



15   we have not proposed a redacted joinder motion, that showed up



16   in a reply brief from the defendant, we didn't move to file a



17   surreply with a possible motion.  We think the best way to



18   proceed, and we're happy to get guidance from your Honor, but



19   once we have rulings from you on what's in the case and what's



20   out, then we might go through the joinder motion.  But where



21   we're sitting today, the joinder motion goes in in its



22   entirety.



23            But what does not come in is then, all right, that's a



24   legal pleading.  Gee, I wonder what happened.  Judge Marra made



25   a ruling, we don't need to get into the details of that ruling.

     H3VOGIU1



 1   Of course, we would want to explain that there were nine



 2   separate reasons why those allegations were included.  Judge



 3   Marra referred to the first of the nine reasons.  We have eight



 4   other additional reasons why those were included.  It would



 5   essentially, again, be a mini trial about, well, what does a



 6   joinder motion mean?  Did you file under Rule 15?  It should



 7   have been under Rule 21.  What did the judge do?



 8            It has no bearing at all on the issues in the case,



 9   and it, of course, has very substantial prejudicial effect



10   because it leads to a confusion of the jury.  The jury's trying



11   to figure out, well, what's going on in the Crime Victims



12   Rights Act case when the issue is whether or not Ms. Giuffre



13   defamed.



14            Now, there is an issue in their pleadings.  They say,



15   well, this could end up being relevant because there might be



16   some kind of a privileged setting issue.  Again, I think your



17   Honor correctly was pointing out a moment ago, if things show



18   up in the trial, it's possible that something could change, but



19   we don't anticipate that becoming an issue in the trial at this



20   point.  If the issue of whether this was a privileged setting



21   somehow becomes an issue in the case, then it would be time to



22   revisit that during the trial.



23            In any event, issues of whether this was a privileged



24   setting or not aren't litigated in front of the jury, that's a



25   legal issue for your Honor to determine whether the setting was

 1   or was not privileged.  We don't take jury evidence on that,



 2   you know, Judge Marra's ruling, and therefore, that should be



 3   excluded.  So that is item number 19.



 4            Let me turn then to item 20, and I'm handling that.



 5   This is essentially a hearsay exercise.  We want information to



 6   be excluded regarding Rebecca Boylan.  Why?  Because Rebecca



 7   Boylan has not been deposed and is not going to be a witness in



 8   the case.



 9            As we understand what the defendant is planning to do,



10   she's planning to call Mr. Dershowitz.  Mr. Dershowitz is going



11   to say Ms. Boylan told him that Ms. Giuffre told him something,



12   and so we have the classic hearsay within a hearsay situation.



13   The problem, of course, is that Boylan is not here.



14            The defendant's pleadings say, ah-hah, but this is an



15   admission by Ms. Giuffre, and it would be if Ms. Boylan were on



16   the stand so we could ask her questions about, well, did



17   Ms. Giuffre really say that?  And what did she mean?  And



18   wasn't she saying that she's been abused by Ms. Maxwell?  But



19   they want to skip over that intermediate stuff, have Dershowitz



20   describe what Boylan describes Ms. Giuffre said, and that's



21   obviously -- and then I'm assuming Dershowitz is going to put



22   his spin on what Ms. Boylan allegedly said to him.  There are



23   no set of circumstances in which that hearsay within hearsay



24   could be admissible because Ms. Boylan has not been deposed,



25   and is not here, it's rank multiple hearsay.

 1            I am about done at this point.



 2            With regard to the remaining issues, you'll be happy



 3   to hear that I think things can be sped up.  We believe that



 4   these issues should simply be, as your Honors I think was



 5   suggesting a moment ago, deferred to trial.



 6            Items 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29, those



 7   were sort of just kind of protective measures.  The one



 8   footnote or caveat we would add to that, your Honor.  We think



 9   this gets punted to the trial, but we would simply ask your



10   Honor to direct defense counsel before they let the cat out of



11   the bag on any of these that there be a sidebar or hearing



12   outside of the jury just so that, you know, our motion in



13   limine doesn't become moot because they've already effectively



14   put it in front of the jury.



15            The one that's of particular concern is alleged bad



16   acts by the defense team.  At various points, I think your



17   Honor, unfortunately, has seen some, you know, frankly



18   aggressive language directed to the plaintiff's team here by



19   the defense team.  We're prepared to respond to each and every



20   one of those allegations.  We've tried not to get into the back



21   and forth because we think it's irrelevant.



22            But if there was to be some kind of an attack launched



23   on any of the members of the Boies Schiller Firm, of Brad



24   Edwards, myself, we would ask that we be given leave to address



25   that at sidebar, in-camera, or outside the presence of the jury

 1   so that we can keep the fact that we have done something bad



 2   that should then be held against our client away from the jury.



 3            But all these remaining things we are in agreement, I



 4   think with the suggestion you were perhaps making a moment ago,



 5   we can deal with these issues at trial.



 6            That's our omnibus motion in limine, your Honor.



 7            THE COURT:  Thank you.



 8            MS. MENNINGER:  The omnibus motion reads like a list



 9   of everything plaintiff has lied about or anything that would



10   undercut her claim for damages.



11            Plaintiff quoted Passim in her reply brief from a



12   particular federal evidence treatise, and I would like to tell



13   the Court, she left out the most important parts, and that is



14   the ones that relate to 405(b).



15            As that treatise reads, Character is an element of a



16   defense in a defamation case if the defending party claims that



17   the statements in question are true and seeks to prove that the



18   plaintiff has the character ascribed to her or to reduce



19   damages by showing that her reputation is so bad the statement



20   did no harm.



21            In such cases, pursuant to Rule 405, all forms of



22   character evidence are admissible wherever relevant, including



23   opinion, reputation, and specific instances of conduct.



24            As your Honor found in our motion to dismiss ruling of



25   February 29th of last year, Though defendant never called

 1   plaintiff a liar, to call her claims obvious lies that have



 2   been shown to be untrue demands the same meaning.  Plaintiff



 3   cannot be making claims shown to be untrue that are obvious



 4   lies without being a liar.



 5            Ms. Maxwell has stated in her answer after that that



 6   her statement was true; that is, plaintiff is a liar.  She is



 7   thus entitled by Rule 405 to introduce all forms of character



 8   evidence, including specific instances of conduct, opinion, and



 9   reputation.



10            What does that evidence look like?  Plaintiff's mother



11   described her as a liar, plaintiff's fiance described her as a



12   liar, plaintiff's employer from 2002 described her as a liar.



13            Your Honor, I would like to start with the first one



14   that plaintiff started with, and that is motion in limine 2,



15   which is Bill Clinton being on the island.



16            Ms. Maxwell is going to testify at this trial, and



17   she's going to testify regarding the obvious lies that



18   plaintiff told her.  One story that plaintiff has told is that



19   Ms. Maxwell was on the island with Bill Clinton and herself at



20   a dinner party.  If I may approach, your Honor?  I have three



21   exhibits.  Two for now.



22            THE COURT:  I think in duplicate, to the extent that I



23   think.

 3            THE COURT:  Yes, I've read it.



 4            MS. MENNINGER:  Okay.  It's the one in which



 5   Ms. Giuffre, on March 5th, 2011, gave a long and lengthy



 6   interview to Sharon Churcher describing her experience on the



 7   island with Bill Clinton, with Al Gore, with Al Gore's wife,



 8   with all kinds of famous people.  And the island event featured



 9   large and media coverage.  If you notice the date of that



10   article, your Honor, it's March 5th, 2011.



11            The next document I provided is a press statement



12   issued by Ghislaine Maxwell on March 10th, 2011, so five days



13   later, in which she writes, care of her attorneys, Ghislaine



14   Maxwell denies the various allegations about her that have



15   appeared recently in the media.  These allegations are all



16   entirely false.



17            Your Honor, the last document I would like to direct



18   your attention to -- by the way, after Ms. Maxwell published



19   this press release, Virginia Roberts did not sue her, she did



20   not claim that she had been emotionally distressed or injured



21   by being called, essentially, a liar in this particular press



22   release.  And also, with respect to the Bill Clinton article,



23   your Honor, the evidence at trial will show a substantial



24   number of emails between Virginia Roberts and Ms. Churcher



25   contemporaneous with this article.  In none of them does she

 1   say, 'You got it wrong.  I never saw Ghislaine Maxwell on a



 2   helicopter with Bill Clinton.  I never said that to you,' she



 3   did none of that.



 4            So your Honor, the last document, and it really, I



 5   think, actually helps clarify the question your Honor raised



 6   when you came out to court this morning, is an email.  It's an



 7   email from Ghislaine Maxwell to Alan Dershowitz, January 6,



 8   2015, and it has a document attached called Four Press



 9   Complaints.



10            Your Honor will notice that this document is not



11   marked confidential, it was produced by Ms. Maxwell over a year



12   ago, it is marked Ghislaine Maxwell 0006, and it's a



13   communication between herself and Alan Dershowitz, someone with



14   whom she does not have a joint defense agreement, and that's



15   why she produced this email.



16            Your Honor, this email, as you can tell from the date,



17   was sent four days after the allegedly defamatory statement at



18   issue.  It reflects Ms. Maxwell's dossier of all of the



19   statements from the papers that have been shown to be



20   completely untrue or show inconsistency in her story.  Each



21   article is listed so you can find that link that references the



22   lies are inconsistencies.



23            Your Honor, if you look at this document that was sent



24   just a few days after the January 2nd email, and you turn to

 2   complaint in the UK, in other words a legal action, the third



 3   page, your Honor, is the document that was attached that was



 4   produced over a year ago.



 5            How this document reads at the top, Drafted by



 6   Ms. Maxwell.  I have copied direct lines and quotes from



 7   articles, and my comments are in orange after the quote.  The



 8   relevant article that the quotes came from is listed below the



 9   last quote.  Below, I think, are some of the irrefutable



10   contradictions and interesting additional details that can be



11   used in the letter to the mail and in the following press



12   complaints.  In addition, this article on Rothstein you may



13   find helpful.



14            What is the number one lie that Ms. Maxwell points



15   to?  Number 1.  Bill Clinton identified in lawsuit against his



16   former friend and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein who had regular



17   orgies.



18            And then Ms. Maxwell's commentary directly afterwards,



19   in a quotation, Huge problem is that Clinton never came to the



20   island.



21            Your Honor, in plaintiff's response -- excuse me --



22   reply brief, they claim Ms. Maxwell had no knowledge in early



23   January, 2015 that Bill Clinton had never been to the island.



24   Obviously, she had knowledge of that because she was claimed to

 3            And here, in January of 2015, Ms. Maxwell is saying he



 4   was never on the island.  It doesn't depend on Louie Freeh or



 5   anybody else.  That's obviously -- in this particular email,



 6   your Honor, she's cataloged all of the changed stories of



 7   Virginia Roberts, all of the lies Virginia Roberts has told,



 8   all of the different news articles in which those lies were



 9   told, and said that this is going to be the basis of her press



10   complaint in the UK.



11            Likewise, on the next page, your Honor, GM009, at the



12   bottom, again, she specifically refutes the claims about Bill



13   Clinton being on the island and says, He was never there.



14   Right after that, she says, Virginia discussed that Al Gore



15   and his wife Tipper were also guests on the island.  And



16   Ms. Maxwell writes, They have also never been on the island,



17   and I don't believe they even know Jeffrey Epstein.



18            So when the jury is asked to consider what Ms. Maxwell



19   meant when she issued, through her attorney and her press



20   agent, the January 2nd, 2015 statement, we have a



21   contemporaneous document drafted by her that was produced in



22   discovery a year ago.  None of it refers to the Jane Doe 102



23   complaint, none of it refers to the CVRA joinder motion.  None



24   of it.  It refers simply to press allegations that have been



25   floating around about her and about her involvement with

 1   Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Roberts.



 2            Plaintiff's counsel has said statements made in the



 3   newspaper articles are hearsay.  That is often true, but when



 4   it's plaintiff's statement in a news article, it's called a



 5   party admission.



 6            Plaintiff complains that she didn't have the



 7   opportunity to depose President Clinton.  Your Honor,



 8   plaintiff's counsel sought to depose President Clinton in their



 9   reply brief at the end of June, 2016, about a week before



10   discovery was to close.  They didn't even mention it in their



11   opening brief, they raised it in docket number 211.



12            In that request, which I didn't have an opportunity to



13   object to because it came in reply, she said she wanted to



14   depose him to, establish his close personal relationship with



15   Epstein, she said nothing about wanting to see whether he had



16   been on the island, whether he flew in a helicopter, or



17   anything like that.



18            With regard to Louie Freeh, your Honor, we disclosed



19   him as a witness in our Rule 26 disclosures last March --



20   excuse me -- February of 2016.  Plaintiff made no effort to try



21   to depose him, made no effort to find out his basis of



22   knowledge.  We produced in discovery his report in which he



23   submitted a FOIA request.



24            Yesterday, you will recall Ms. McCawley testifying



25   about how she, herself, issued a FOIA request and got in



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

 1   response an FBI 302 motion -- excuse me -- statement of -- she



 2   claims is authentic, but she doesn't know how it was redacted,



 3   doesn't explain how it's redacted, but she wants to admit that



 4   into evidence.



 5            We are actually offering to put on the stand the



 6   person who submitted the FOIA request to explain what was



 7   requested and what was received.  That is not expert testimony,



 8   your Honor, that's chain of custody.



 9            With regard to motion in limine number 5, evidence of



10   denials by Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace.  Again, your



11   Honor, in a defamation case -- and I'm now quoting from



12   plaintiff's treatise that they cited throughout their response



13   and their reply -- excuse me -- In defamation cases,



14   defendants can also prove that other liables and rumors about



15   the claimant are circulating, at least if they are widespread,



16   to demonstrate that it is not what the defendant said about the



17   plaintiff that causes her reputation to suffer but what others



18   said.



19            Plaintiff also cites Sack of Defamation.  He supports



20   our position, your Honor.  Here, we have a statement by



21   Buckingham Palace that was issued on the internet and widely



22   circulated.  There is also a videotape of Prince Andrew denying



23   Virginia Roberts' claims.  Both of those were far more



24   circulated than anything Ms. Maxwell said, as evidenced by the



25   fact that plaintiff can't even find Ms. Maxwell's statement on



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

 1   the internet anywhere quoted in whole.



 2            Also, Alan Dershowitz widely circulated his denials of



 3   plaintiff's claims.  He was on Good Morning America, he was on



 4   CNN's Nancy Grace Show, he was on Fox News.  All of those



 5   places he called Virginia Roberts a liar, and a serial liar,



 6   and other things.



 7            We are entitled, your Honor, both through cross



 8   examination of plaintiff as well as cross examination of her



 9   experts, to challenge whether or not anything said by



10   Ms. Maxwell caused damage to her reputation or whether other



11   people calling her a liar on national news and international



12   news is, in fact, the cause of any damage to her reputation.



13            She is the one, of course, who has put her reputation



14   at issue.  Having the Duke of York and Buckingham Palace issue



15   denials is not hearsay, your Honor, it is offered for the fact



16   that the denial was widely circulated and very likely



17   contributed to people considering plaintiff to be a liar.



18            Motion in limine number 6, plaintiff's sexual history



19   and reputation.  This salient point, your Honor, of course,



20   again, under 405(b), is that once you have put your reputation



21   for being a liar in question, then other specific instances of



22   false claims become highly relevant and probative of your



23   character for truthfulness, particularly with regard to sexual



24   assault and sexual abuse.



25            Furthermore, your Honor, plaintiff is the one who's

 1   claiming she has damages of post-traumatic stress disorder, and



 2   she is the one who is going to call to the stand her



 3   psychiatrist to talk about that patient, and she is the one



 4   that gave him evidence about these other acts to him and on



 5   which he has relied in reaching his conclusions.  It is



 6   impossible for us to not be able to cross examine her expert



 7   about preexisting PTSD caused by incidents and events unrelated



 8   to Ms. Maxwell.



 9            Motion in limine number 7, whether or not Ms. Giuffre



10   can be called a prostitute.  Your Honor, no one in this case,



11   no counsel, nobody that I'm aware of involved with the



12   litigation has referred to Virginia Giuffre as a slut.  That is



13   something that plaintiff's counsel has brought up, and you will



14   notice there is absolutely no cite in any record, in any



15   document referring to her as such.



16            What has come up, your Honor, are internet sites in



17   which Ms. Giuffre has been called all kinds of things that are



18   unrelated to Ms. Maxwell, that do not cite Ms. Maxwell.  For



19   example, her friends gave interviews to the press in which they



20   described -- and this is attached as my Exhibit L -- described



21   Virginia Giuffre as a money hungry sex kitten who enjoyed her



22   lavish lifestyle.  We cannot talk about plaintiff's reputation



23   on the internet without talking about what is out there on the



24   internet.  We cannot cross examine her or cross examine her



25   experts about what her reputation is if we can't ask about

 1   these other things that are circulating about her that have



 2   nothing to do with Ms. Maxwell.



 3            Mr. Cassell referred to our expert Phillip Esplin,



 4   Dr. Esplin, and saying that he agreed not to refer to Virginia



 5   Roberts as a prostitute.  Your Honor, that came up in the



 6   context of a cross examination in which he said he has no idea



 7   whether any of her claims are credible or not.  He does not



 8   believe it's within the province of the psychiatrist to be



 9   making credibility determinations.  So he was not in any way



10   suggesting, in fact he testified for hours to the contrary,



11   that he knows whether her claims of being a prostitute are true



12   or not true, and he agreed not to talk about.



13            The only context in which I think this comes up, your



14   Honor, are witnesses or people on the internet who have made



15   disparaging remarks about the plaintiff that have to be the



16   subject of her reputation and her request for damages that she



17   says are related to Ms. Maxwell.



18            Plaintiff's drug abuse, motion in limine number 8.



19   They have conceded, as they must, that the period of time about



20   which Ms. Giuffre is testifying is fair game for her discussion



21   of all of her illegal drug use.  And it wasn't just



22   prescription drugs, she has testified that she was on a number



23   of different drugs at the time, and that because of those



24   drugs, her memory of events from 2000 are, quote/unquote,



25   foggy.  And she says that's one of the reasons she can't

 1   remember the names of the foreign presidents that she was



 2   trafficked to, and these other famous people, because she was



 3   taking so many drugs she just can't remember.



 4            Obviously, your Honor, a witness' ability to perceive



 5   and recall and relate events that happened a long time ago that



 6   were affected by drug use need to be brought to light before



 7   the jury.



 8            The second issue, your Honor, relates to the use of



 9   prescription medication.  What you heard plaintiff say is they



10   would like to introduce evidence that she's taking prescription



11   drugs properly, but they want to exclude us from cross



12   examining her about that to see whether or not she was taking



13   prescription drugs improperly.  That's called cross



14   examination, your Honor.



15            Her use of prescription drugs has been well-documented



16   in her doctor's records, and she has made false statements to



17   her doctors regarding her need for prescription drugs.  She's



18   gone from one doctor to the next, telling one that she hasn't



19   taken any Valium for years, and then the next one -- and then



20   we have the records showing that that's just not true.  She's



21   told doctors that she was stressed out about a big litigation



22   in New York, she told a doctor that in the year 2014, this



23   lawsuit wasn't filed until 2015, so she's made statements to



24   doctors that are inaccurate.



25            Your Honor, her statements reflected in her medical

 1   records may or may not be admissible depending on what she says



 2   on the stand, but they are her statements and they are,



 3   therefore, potentially admissible as admissions of a party



 4   opponent under 801(d)(2).



 5            Moreover, her doctor is the one who wants to testify



 6   about her need for medications going forward, and he has been



 7   the one who's talked about her previous use of medications.



 8   Her Colorado doctor testified that she had misled him and not



 9   fully disclosed her need for prescription medications, and



10   there's also the question about whether or not, if she opens



11   the door and says she's properly used medications for



12   post-traumatic stress disorder, then we should be able to



13   examine her, not only with respect to that, but her other use



14   of prescription and illegal drugs.



15            And your Honor, I think it is inappropriately limiting



16   to say we can only talk about her use of drugs during the



17   period of '99 to 2002 because any drug use that she has used in



18   the meantime can go to establish whether or not she truly had



19   post-traumatic stress disorder or any other mental health



20   disorder.



21            She has filed a lawsuit asking for $30 million in



22   emotional distress, pain and suffering, and her doctor is going



23   to testify that she needs medications as a part of managing



24   that pain and stress and emotional distress.  If she's been



25   using drugs in the interim that may affect her memory, if she's

 5            Motion in limine 9, plaintiff's criminal history.  If



 6   I understand plaintiff's argument, they do not want her to be



 7   cross examined either under 608(b) or 405(b) with regard to a



 8   specific instance of dishonesty; that is, her theft from her



 9   employer.



10            There are legions of cases, your Honor, that find



11   theft to be a crime of dishonesty and admissible for proof of



12   character of dishonesty.



13            Not only, your Honor, did she get charged by the



14   authorities in Florida with this crime of theft from her



15   employer, an arrest warrant was issued for her, that arrest



16   warrant was outstanding at the time she, quote/unquote, fled to



17   Thailand.  That arrest warrant remained outstanding until the



18   year, I think 2009 or 2010, when it was quashed.  Plaintiff



19   failed to come back to this country during that entire time.



20   It got quashed because it had been such a long passage of time.



21            THE COURT:  Who was the employer?



22            MS. MENNINGER:  It was the Roadhouse Grill, your



23   Honor.  It was a burger joint.  And she was working at that



24   Roadhouse Grill in March of 2002 during the period of time she

 2   dollars by Jeffrey Epstein, and this was happening 24/7.  And



 3   we asked in discovery, and we got a bunch of records, not only



 4   of her working at the Roadhouse Grill, but also of her working



 5   at a bunch of other restaurants, at a veterinarian's office,



 6   all kinds of things during the period of time that she says she



 7   was a -- what is commonly known as a sex slave, is how she



 8   described it in her papers.



 9            Your Honor, she compounded the lie about the theft



10   because she wrote a book manuscript, as you know.  And in that



11   book manuscript, she describes that it was not her who took the



12   money from the tip jar, it was her boyfriend, Tony Figueroa,



13   and that's also what she testified during her deposition.
