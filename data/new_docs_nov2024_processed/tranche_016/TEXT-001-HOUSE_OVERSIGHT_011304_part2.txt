14            She said, for example, that she didn't commit the



15   theft, that he came in at the end of her shift, and while she



16   wasn't looking, he's the one that took the tips.



17            Well, we deposed Tony Figueroa, and Tony Figueroa,



18   your Honor might be surprised to hear, is a gentleman with



19   several felonies to his name, which he gladly recounted on the



20   witness stand on videotape.  He talked about all the thefts he



21   has committed, thefts from a video store, he was charged with



22   felonies, he was put on probation for ten years, he recently



23   had gotten out, but he actually denied that he was the one who



24   took the money from the tip jar.



25            So there's the lie, there's the tip jar theft, then

 1   there's the lie about the tip jar theft, and then there is the



 2   arrest warrant that was issued that plaintiff left the country



 3   for over a decade while that arrest warrant was outstanding.



 4            Your Honor, the fact of police contacts during this



 5   timeframe, including this one, go directly to other issues,



 6   including whether or not plaintiff was truly the sex slave that



 7   she describes.  She had an opportunity, because she called the



 8   police on numbers of occasions during the relevant time



 9   period -- she called them to report a theft, she called them to



10   help with a civil assist getting her out of her apartment, she



11   called them for all kinds of reasons -- and at none of those



12   points of time did she tell the police that she was currently



13   then a, quote/unquote, sex slave.



14            Your Honor, the Roadhouse Grill also -- the Mail On



15   Sunday is the one who printed a story about the Roadhouse Grill



16   and confronted her aunt who was being interviewed for one of



17   their stories about it.  The aunt was in the process of saying



18   what a great niece she had, and then the news asked her about



19   the Roadhouse Grill theft, and she said, Wow, I didn't even



20   know that she was working in a burger joint.  So it goes to



21   her internet reputation.



22            And finally, your Honor, I think if you look back to



23   that email between our client and Mr. Dershowitz on page GM009,



24   it's one of the lies that our client specifically referred to.



25   She quotes Virginia Giuffre's statement, Jeffrey bought me

 1   jewelry, diamonds were his favorite, and wonderful furniture.



 2   He was paying me very well because I'd give him sex whenever he



 3   wanted, to which our client responded, If he was paying her



 4   so well, why steal from her burger job in 2002?  So it's



 5   within our client's knowledge on January 6, 2015, and that is



 6   an additional reason why it should be admitted going to her



 7   state of mind or actual malice, as plaintiff likes to call it.



 8            Your Honor, with respect to the school records, the



 9   school records are what they are.  They explain that she was in



10   school during the entire time she claims that she was a sex



11   slave, it gives her numbers of days of attendance, I don't



12   understand why those records wouldn't be admitted in cross



13   examination of her as to her whereabouts at certain occasions.



14   Plaintiff certainly intends to introduce flight logs to show



15   that she was or wasn't in certain places, so school records



16   show where she was and wasn't on certain dates, and that's



17   important, your Honor.



18            Moreover, plaintiff is the one who told Sharon



19   Churcher about her own problems with school.  She told Sharon



20   Churcher, and Sharon Churcher published with her authorization



21   that she went back to school to get her GED, and she wanted to



22   study for massage.  She talked about dropping out of school.



23   Police records reflect the fact that she was a truant during



24   this period of time, that her mother was concerned about her



25   abusing drugs and alcohol.  The school records intimately

 1   intersect with the entire story that plaintiff has told about



 2   being a sex slave in the years 1999 to 2002.



 3            Also, your Honor, they go to damages because plaintiff



 4   has claimed that she should be entitled to a certain amount of



 5   damages, and her own experts have talked about her being a



 6   troubled child.  Again, this is something that they told their



 7   psychiatric expert, and he relied on finding that she was a



 8   troubled child, and then he's made inferences from there about



 9   why she should be entitled to certain damages, and I think the



10   school records are a fair game for cross examination of him.



11            Motion in limine number 11, her bad childhood



12   behavior.  Again, your Honor, this is exactly -- plaintiff went



13   in to see the psychiatrist, went in to see hers and our



14   independent medical examiner, and in both cases she described



15   all of her, quote/unquote, bad childhood behavior.  So it goes



16   to her damages, your Honor.  They want to elicit what they want



17   to elicit and keep us from eliciting anything that would



18   contradict it.



19            But putting your reputation and your character in



20   issue, as she has in this case, about the time when she was a



21   child is necessarily a part of our cross examination to explain



22   to a jury what her reputation at the time of the acts in



23   question were.



24            She was a truant, reported to the schools as a truant,



25   reported by her mother to the police, circulated with people in

 1   the community out trying to find her, and she was known as such



 2   in her community.  So to say somehow that we can't talk about



 3   her reputation for truth telling, her reputation for honesty at



 4   the time she was a child when she claims that she was the



 5   victim of sex abuse, is not supported by the law.



 6            Plaintiff also cites to Sack on Defamation, and I



 7   believe the cite is 10, Section 5.  And your Honor, I think



 8   this helps clarify a lot of what our position is in this case.



 9            Sack believes, as we do, that it is entirely



10   appropriate under 405(b) to question a plaintiff who has



11   alleged defamation, whose reputation is an issue about all



12   kinds of bad acts.  They have said, just now, that there is



13   just no reason we should be allowed to ask about all these



14   other bad acts.



15            Sack cites, your Honor, to an Eleventh Circuit case,



16   Schafer vs. Time, Inc.  In that case, your Honor, Sack says the



17   Eleventh Circuit found the district court had been correct when



18   it ruled that the defendant, which allegedly accused the



19   plaintiff of being a traitor, would be permitted to question



20   the plaintiff about a felony conviction, a possible violation



21   of his subsequent parole, convictions for driving under the



22   influence, an arrest for writing a bad check, failure to file



23   tax returns, failure to pay alimony and child support, and



24   evidence concerning plaintiff's efforts to change his name and



25   social security number.  In other words, once you put your

 1   reputation at issue, all of these specific instances going to



 2   your honesty are fair game.



 3            In this case, we have asked plaintiff whether she



 4   filed tax returns.  She said, No.  Tax fraud is not a private



 5   matter, as plaintiff contends, it is a crime.  It is a crime of



 6   dishonesty.



 7            She likewise put into her complaint that her



 8   reputation was injured in her professional capacity as



 9   President of Victims Refuse Silence.  We inquired whether



10   Victims Refuse Silence was, indeed, a legitimate enterprise.



11   We learned that they had not met their tax obligations and they



12   had not been funded.  That is, as your Honor knows, the subject



13   of 702 motions, so I won't repeat it all here.



14            I will say, however, that both of those issues,



15   failure to file tax returns and tax fraud, are exactly the



16   kinds of evidence permissible under 405(b) when you are



17   attempting to establish the truth of your statement that



18   plaintiff is a liar.



19            Motion 14, evidence of being a victim of domestic



20   violence.  Your Honor, in this case, plaintiff claims



21   $30 million in pain, suffering, and emotional distress.



22   Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Kliman, testified that domestic



23   violence by her husband is likely a cause of exacerbation of



24   her PTSD.  He also testified it was a very violent episode and



25   more likely happened more than once.  He also testified that

 1   she needs additional marital and sexual counseling based on her



 2   disinterest in sex, which she claims is caused by the



 3   defamatory statement.



 4            Our expert, your Honor, likewise found that the far



 5   more likely cause of any dysfunction in her marriage which



 6   arose at the time of the domestic violence incident and was



 7   more likely the cause of any PTSD pain, suffering, or emotional



 8   distress that she was experiencing.



 9            That domestic violence incident happened in early



10   March, 2015, a couple of months after the allegedly defamatory



11   statement, and seven months before plaintiff brought this



12   lawsuit.



13            The criminal proceedings against her husband also are



14   relevant to her damages, apart from Dr. Kliman's testimony.



15   Her husband was ordered to live away from their home, leaving



16   her to care for her three children alone.  He then stopped



17   participating in the court-ordered domestic violence



18   counseling, and he fled the country with an active arrest



19   warrant that remains outstanding to this date from Colorado.



20            All of these alternative sources of emotional distress



21   for plaintiff should be admitted, as her expert, Dr. Kliman,



22   has testified, in as far as they impact supposed pain,



23   suffering, loss of enjoyment of life.

25   with a 17-year-old girl is, quote/unquote, lawful.  Plaintiff

 2   various places at various times, some when she was 17, some

 4   England, some in New York, some in New Mexico.  In all of those



 5   cases, except Florida, the age of consent is 17.



 6            I don't know what evidence plaintiff is going to



 7   introduce about what sex she had, where, with whom, and her age



 8   at that time because those sands have shifted dramatically



 9   during the course of this litigation.  All I can say, your



10   Honor, is, if she tries to introduce evidence that she had sex



11   at a certain place and time and claimed that it was unlawful,



12   your Honor will be duty bound to instruct a jury on what is or



13   isn't lawful in a particular jurisdiction at a particular time



14   in a particular place.



15            Your Honor, I would submit that motion in limine 16



16   regarding the medical records, again, is something that depends



17   dramatically on what plaintiff introduces during her case in



18   chief, but there are many statements, as I mentioned earlier,



19   to her doctors which would be admitted as nonhearsay if offered



20   against her as party admission.



21            There are many statements over the last 15 years that



22   relate to her mental condition, that relate to her medications.



23   Do I anticipate asking about her ferret bite?  I do not.  Do I



24   anticipate asking about the other things that are listed in her



25   motion in limine?  I do not.  But I do believe that there are a

 1   number of times that she saw doctors, made statements, sought



 2   treatment, got medications, all of which are reflected in her



 3   medical records and are something that about which she may be



 4   cross examined.



 5            She claims her medical records are private.  She is



 6   the one seeking $30 million in emotional distress, pain and



 7   suffering, and I think when you do that, I'm sure her lawyers



 8   advised her that her privacy rights with respect to her medical



 9   records would no longer be the same as a private individual.



10            Your Honor, Motion in limine 17, again, the dollar



11   value of the Jane Doe settlement depends entirely on what



12   happens in terms of plaintiff's case in chief and whether any



13   other evidence regarding the Jane Doe 102 litigation comes into



14   evidence, because if it does, then the settlement and the



15   settlement amount may very well become relevant, but I can't



16   say right now how anyone intends to use that at trial, why it



17   would be relevant, and I can't say whether or not the



18   settlement amount would likewise be relevant.



19            Motion in limine 18, the Cassell-Edwards-Dershowitz



20   litigation and their settlement.  It's interesting to note



21   Mr. Cassell to refer to himself in the third person when he was



22   talking about that litigation.

 4   testimony in that case is admissible.



 5            She participated in that case, your Honor, from March



 6   of 2015 or so until it settled in or around April of 2016, and



 7   she reported to her doctors that it was causing her a



 8   significant amount of stress.  In fact, shortly before she was



 9   deposed in that case she went to a doctor and requested that



10   she get more Valium to help her handle her upcoming deposition.



11            Dr. Miller, our psychiatrist, found that her



12   participation in that lawsuit as a witness caused her



13   significant stress and explained many of her complained of



14   symptoms, and he said that they were exacerbated by her



15   participation in that litigation.



16            Third, evidence regarding that lawsuit goes to her



17   reputational damages.  Again, your Honor, I refer to the



18   federal evidence treatise relied on by plaintiff.  In



19   defamation cases, defendants can also prove other liables and



20   rumors about the claimant are circulating, at least if they are



21   widespread, to demonstrate it is not what the defendant said



22   about the plaintiff that caused her reputation to suffer but



23   what others said.



24            Your Honor has read the 702 pleadings.  Plaintiff's



25   experts have pulled off the internet all kinds of stories that

 1   relate to plaintiff and said that those stories are evidence of



 2   her damaged reputation.  When you look at the stories that



 3   actually were pulled off the internet, a substantial number of



 4   them relate to the Cassell-Edwards-Dershowitz litigation; what



 5   happened in the litigation, statements made by the parties in



 6   the litigation, statements made about Virginia Giuffre relevant



 7   to that litigation.



 8            If her reputation is damaged by some other litigation



 9   that has nothing to do with Ms. Maxwell, Ms. Maxwell can't be



10   responsible for that reputational damage.

16   damage her reputation?

20            MS. MENNINGER:  There was a lot of press attendant to



21   that case which was, frankly, negative to the plaintiff that



22   had nothing do with Ms. Maxwell's denial.  And their experts



23   have relied on that press and claimed that that press somehow

 6   alternate sources, including stories that were generated by



 7   statements made by her own counsel, by Alan Dershowitz, by



 8   Prince Andrew, by anyone else.

10   out, what about that case was damaging to Giuffre?



11            MS. MENNINGER:  I can't tell you that, your Honor.



12   It's actually plaintiffs who are asking for $1.9 million in



13   reputational cleanup costs, and when you ask them what



14   reputational cleanup costs are you trying to clean up, they



15   point to stories having to do with the Dershowitz litigation.



16   They say her reputation was damaged by that litigation and by



17   the stories related to it, and they want to push all of those



18   stories down on the internet searches.  Not stories that relate



19   to Ms. Maxwell, stories that relate to her litigation with --



20   her lawyer's litigation with Alan Dershowitz.



21            THE COURT:  Okay.



22            MS. MENNINGER:  I don't think that evidence should



23   come in because I don't think it's based on science, but I

 4            Finally, your Honor, there is, as you heard from



 5   Mr. Cassell, talking about Cassell lawsuit, a statement issued



 6   that that lawsuit was a mistake.  Whether her attorneys have



 7   made representations, they did so while they were representing



 8   plaintiff.  This was while Mr. Cassell and Mr. Edwards were



 9   both pursuing their own lawsuit and also representing plaintiff



10   in this case.  So any statements that they issued that are



11   within the scope of their agency, your Honor, are



12   representations, frankly, made by plaintiff.



13            With regard to the Judge Marra order, motion in limine



14   19, your Honor, plaintiff would like to make a lot of arguments



15   now.  She's already litigated those points.  She lost.  She's



16   collaterally estopped from reraising them.  And it would be



17   seriously misleading, your Honor, to admit the joinder motion

24   It's not an appropriate motion in limine.  I know what the



25   rules of evidence are with regard to hearsay and double

 1   hearsay.



 2            That's also true, your Honor, largely with respect to



 3   the rest of the motions.  They are asking for an advisory



 4   opinion from this Court about things that may or may not



 5   happen.  Your Honor, I just don't see the need to waste more



 6   time on it.



 7            There is only one issue, the one raised in 28 where we



 8   have presented the possibility that as the party that bears the



 9   burden of proof, we would be allowed during closing arguments,



10   for example, to comment on the lack of proof, which is a common



11   closing argument.



12            If they have control over a party and that party



13   doesn't come and testify, we may, under the appropriate



14   circumstances and with the right foundation, ask for a missing



15   witness instruction, your Honor, but these are all advisory



16   questions at this point.



17            MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, Sigrid McCawley on behalf



18   of the plaintiff.  Would the Court like to take a break at this



19   point?  I know we've gone for a couple hours.  I'm not sure how



20   you'd like to proceed.  We're happy to address --



21            THE COURT:  Let's finish.



22            MS. McCAWLEY:  Let's finish.  Okay, great.  Thank you.



23            MR. CASSELL:  Paul Cassell, your Honor, for



24   Ms. Giuffre.



25            The defense started with an overview of Rule 405(b),



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                                71

     H3VOGIU1



 1   so let meet respond to that overview.



 2            They reference Mueller and Kirkpatrick, a treatise



 3   that we think is very instructive on this particular point.



 4            Mueller and Kirkpatrick says, It is true that in a



 5   defamation case there is more latitude to introducing



 6   reputational types of evidence.  However, it's important to



 7   remember, say Mueller and Kirkpatrick, that actual character is



 8   not so much the question as reputation.



 9            And it follows that specific instances of misconduct



10   cannot be proved if they were not generally known because then



11   they would not affect reputation.



12            They go on to say that, When a defendant's proof goes



13   to specific instances under 405(b), caution from the judge is



14   in order.  Proving misbehavior can, in effect, become a game of



15   character assassination that adds insult to injury which courts



16   can block by carefully considering relevancy issues and the



17   rule against unfair prejudice found in Rule 403.  And so it is



18   against that backdrop that the Court should be considering



19   these 405 issues.



20            What I would like to do is offer three illustrations



21   of what I think is going to be a pervasive flaw in many of the



22   arguments advanced by the defense.



23            So we heard that, Your Honor, look under 405(b).  The



24   fact that the mother -- plaintiff's mother described her as a



25   liar about using drugs and running away from home, that comes



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                                72

     H3VOGIU1



 1   in to show reputation.  Let me explain why I believe that



 2   argument is fundamentally flawed, and that will, of course,



 3   carry over to other illustrations, as well.



 4            The statement to which defense counsel was referring



 5   was a statement that Ms. Giuffre's mother made during a



 6   deposition as a witness in this case where the only people in



 7   the room were the court reporter and the attorneys.  The fact



 8   that when asked, What did you think of your daughter 17 years



 9   ago?  Well, I thought at the time that she was a liar, wasn't



10   something that goes to Ms. Giuffre's reputation because there's



11   no evidence anybody knew about it other than, you know, the



12   mother who is now being deposed in 2016.



13            Moreover, the question was, What did you think about



14   the fact that your then 17-year-old child was running away from



15   school?  Well, I thought she was lying to me about that.  That



16   would go, I guess, to her reputation back in, what, 1999, 2000,



17   2001, that time period, but of course the damages that are at



18   issue in this case are damages around 2016 and thereabouts when



19   the defamatory statement is released.



20            So it's hard to see even an argument for the statement



21   of the mom in a deposition going to reputation.  I don't know,



22   maybe I'm missing something, maybe there's some marginal



23   relevance that can be distilled out of all of that.  But of



24   course then your Honor has to weigh whatever marginal value



25   that has as to reputational issues against the very significant

 1   prejudicial effect.



 2            Obviously, this is going to be considered by the jury



 3   to think she's a bad kid.  They're not going to like



 4   Ms. Giuffre, and they're going to hold it against her, not



 5   because it has some technical reputational aspect to it, but



 6   because it is something that shows she's a bad person.  Under



 7   403, the evidence should be excluded.



 8            Let me give you a second illustration of reputational



 9   points.  They say, Ah-ha, look.  Ms. Giuffre went to



10   Dr. Kliman, and I believe your Honor referred to that as well.



11   And your Honor asked, I think, a very good question, and let me



12   see if I can answer that question.



13            You said, Well, why did she disclose all this stuff



14   to Dr. Kliman?  Well, the answer is obvious, she was under



15   instructions from the doctor to tell everything that happened,



16   and of course she told, to the best of her ability, everything



17   that happened.  Some of the stuff is going to turn out in a



18   court of law to be relevant, some of this stuff in a court of



19   law is going to turn out to be irrelevant.  But that's not the



20   psychiatrist's job to say, 'No, no, no, don't talk about



21   illegal drug use because the prejudicial effect outweighs the



22   probative value,' he just gets a full medical history.  And



23   having collected all that information, you know, through



24   Dr. Kliman, or they also have Dr. Miller who did a similar sort



25   of thing.  Now once you have all of this vast array of



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

 1   information, then the lawyers present arguments to your Honor



 2   and say, 'Wait a minute.  Some of the things that are in the



 3   report aren't relevant to the case and, in fact, are going to



 4   be highly prejudicial for the jury.'  That's why we're here



 5   this morning asking for some of those things to be excluded.



 6            For example, there are some references -- I won't



 7   belabor the point -- but the references that we're making to



 8   some of the illegal drug usage and so forth, that's not



 9   something we're trying to deploy affirmatively.  The good



10   doctor simply listed all of the information that had been



11   recited as part of his report so that the lawyers and the judge



12   can now make a determination.



13            And the fact that Ms. Giuffre told Dr. Kliman in a



14   confidential psychiatric examination certain things about drug



15   use can't possibly go to her reputation because no one was



16   there who was assessing what kinds of things might be going on.



17            A similar point can be made about tax fraud.  We're



18   told, Well, your Honor, tax fraud goes to her reputation.  I



19   suppose that goes to her reputation with some IRS agent who is



20   looking at a return, but it can't possibly go to a general



21   reputation that is at issue in this case.



22            And once again, the cases that we cite in our briefs I



23   think make this point clear, there is a vast risk of



24   prejudicial effect to Ms. Giuffre because the jury is going to



25   think, oh, she's a tax cheat, and they're going to hold that

 1   against her because they don't like her actions in that



 2   particular circumstance as opposed to the merits of the case.



 3            And by the way, we are going to strongly contest that



 4   she's a tax cheat, so your Honor is going to have, I guess,



 5   competing tax information, and jury instructions on whether



 6   personal injury returns have to be reported on your return, all



 7   of which is going to deflect the jury's time and attention, not



 8   to mention the Court's and counsel's, away from the fundamental



 9   issue of did Ms. Maxwell defame Ms. Giuffre.  So that's our



10   response to the initial overview regarding 405, and I'm going



11   to turn the time over to my colleague now to dive into some



12   specifics.



13            MS. McCAWLEY:  Thank you, your Honor.  I'm going try



14   to keep this very brief and just touch on some of the



15   highlights quickly.



16            So we were talking initially at the beginning about



17   the issue of various pieces of different witnesses, whether



18   their information would come in, and we hit on the issue --



19   they brought up the issue of Mr. Freeh, and actually gave



20   you -- told you that he was going to be just somebody who was



21   going to sit on the stand and validate the FOIA response.



22            Well, very clear from the documents they've produced



23   in this case, if I could hand them up, your Honor, this is the



24   pages that they produced with respect to Mr. Freeh.  And you'll



25   see on the first page, he gives his conclusion and he says,

 1   Based on my experience, knowledge, and duties of these



 2   protocols in the USS Protective Details of Special Agents, a



 3   company escorting Mr. Clinton -- so he is relying on his



 4   expertise as a former FBI head in order to opine on whether or



 5   not these records are correct, your Honor.



 6            They disclosed him as a lay witness in this case, not



 7   an as an expert witness.  We went through a series -- as you



 8   know your Honor, you've seen all the expert depositions in this



 9   case that we've had.  They say, Well, you could have deposed



10   him as a lay witness.



11            Your Honor, will remember, we were very limited.  We



12   were limited to ten depos.  We had to beg, borrow, and steal to



13   get a few more, and we had to be very careful in who we picked



14   and chose with respect to establishing our claims.  If we had



15   known, of course, that Mr. Freeh was going to be put on the



16   stand as an expert in this case, we, of course, would have



17   sought his deposition through the expert process.



18            So, your Honor, I think those documents speak for



19   themselves.  They're very clear, that's GMOO526, where he's



20   giving that clear opinion.  The letter is sent to



21   Mr. Dershowitz and he signs it, and then it has the relevant



22   attachments.  So, your Honor, we firmly believe that that



23   should be kept out of evidence because he was not disclosed



24   properly as an expert in this case.



25            The other thing I want to point your attention to is

 1   another document that they gave you, and I think this document



 2   is really telling for what it doesn't say, and that's the email



 3   traffic.



 4            Right after -- a few days after she makes the



 5   defamatory statement, she's conversing with Alan Dershowitz



 6   about this statement.  And this is GM0006 through 00015.



 7            What's really interesting about this is nowhere in



 8   this statement does she say, 'I didn't participate in this



 9   abuse.  I didn't know this person.  I wasn't around.  This



10   didn't happen with JE.' Instead, she picks statements and says



11   things like -- which sound like a jealous girlfriend -- she



12   says, I called Jeffrey and told him I've fallen madly in love,



13   Virginia says.  I was hoping he'd be delighted, but he said,



14   Have a nice life and hung up on me.  And she puts in parens



15   to Mr. Dershowitz, Did she want Jeffrey to say no, don't do



16   it, I want to marry you?



17            Clearly, she knows -- while during her deposition she



18   claimed to not recollect my client whatsoever, she clearly



19   knows her and this shows that they were together.



20            It's also interesting, if you look on page 0008,



21   because she's putting in parens individuals, other people that



22   my client was lent out to that they forgot to mention in the



23   list that they give.  I mean, what's really telling about this



24   document is what it doesn't say, but it clearly shows she knew



25   my client, she knew what was occurring, and she's simply trying

 1   to pick apart nuances in the statement.  So, your Honor, I



 2   submit that to you for what it doesn't say from Ms. Maxwell



 3   since they've provided that to you today.



 4            There are a few more things that I just want to touch



 5   on that I think need to be clarified, and that is, with respect



 6   to -- there was this mention about newspaper articles, and as



 7   you know we've submitted an expert who analyzed through his web



 8   analytics, he's the same expert that was in the Anders case who



 9   followed that video of the Fox reporter over the internet and



10   tracked that he uses a well-accepted methodology.  We've set



11   that forth all in our papers.



12            But he tracked the specific quoted statements, your



13   Honor.  And if they have an issue, if they want to say, oh,



14   they're proposing today that these articles related to the



15   Dershowitz matter, that's subject for cross examination of him



16   if they want, but he has a very clear methodology, and those



17   articles that he tracked were in that manner, your Honor, so I



18   just want to make that point since they raised it.  I know



19   we're not discussing the experts in detail today, but I did ask



20   that question.



21            So your Honor, in just summarizing on those points, I



22   think we made clear in our opening argument why we believe that



23   this shouldn't be subject to a number of mini trials on a



24   variety of these issues, we're hoping to streamline this



25   matter, and that's why we proposed this motion in limine to you

 1   in the way that we did.



 2            I'm just going to let my counsel address any final



 3   issues.



 4            MS. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, I don't have anything



 5   further to say on motion in limine number 6.  The defendant has



 6   not given any valid reason or justification for introducing any



 7   evidence of prior sexual assault that should be excluded for



 8   all the reasons in the brief and the oral argument over these



 9   two days.



10            With regard to drugs, there are voluminous medical



11   records presented here.  Defendant's counsel has stood up and



12   said there are false statements to doctors and have suggested



13   that Ms. Giuffre is doctor shopping.  I'll submit that the



14   records do not reflect that.



15            Defendant apparently seeks to introduce a jotted down



16   note here or there from medical records, but these are plainly



17   hearsay, and a sentence fragment in the middle of a medical



18   chart is not admissible evidence, it's hearsay.  And then,



19   they're certainly not a party admission, they don't even



20   reflect the totality of what the conversation is between



21   patient and doctor.



22            Also, I would also submit that the prescription



23   records show that they are not doctor shopping to a mass



24   amounts of pills or medication.  The prescription records speak



25   for themselves.  You can count the number of pills that were

 1   prescribed over a period of time, and you'll understand that



 2   this is not a situation of someone being a drugee and doctor



 3   shopping, something that's in the news a lot these days.  So



 4   trying to submit it that way is not only irrelevant to this



 5   case, but the prejudice greatly outweighs whatever probative



 6   value it might be.  Ms. Giuffre would not, of course, object to



 7   testifying with regard to what current medication she takes,



 8   but that's a different subject altogether.



 9            With regard to criminal history, as I mentioned,



10   Ms. Giuffre denied that she stole the money.  She said her



11   boyfriend took the money while he was there with her.  And



12   defense counsel reminded Court that this victim is a thief.



13   Again, none of this information comes in under the Federal



14   Rules of Evidence.  Even the charging document and the warrant



15   are classic hearsay and should be excluded.



16            With regard to the next one, I'm going to skip ahead



17   to school records.  The records don't show that she was in



18   school, as much as defendant seems to think she is.  They don't



19   have also what days she attended and what days she doesn't.  It



20   doesn't say that she was there on, for example, May 23rd, 2000.



21   What they do show is that there are no courses taken between



22   1999 and the 2000 school year, and no courses taken during the



23   2000 to 2001 school years.

25   another school as as a tenth grader in the 2001 to 2002 school

 1   year was limited to a portion of the school year starting



 2   October 20th, 2001, ending only in March 7th, 2002, which only



 3   further substantiates Ms. Giuffre's testimony that at one point



 4   she attempted to get away from defendant's abuse, along with --



 5   and Mr. Figueroa testified to the same.



 6            So again, I would also reiterate that her reputation



 7   as a child for being a truant or a runaway is not what is at



 8   issue in this case.  She is a 30-something-year-old woman and



 9   did not have a reputation related to her school attendance.



10            There is also in this case zero evidence of her



11   not-for-profit being a tax fraud.  It's not funded and it's in



12   compliance with United States tax rules.



13            Additionally, Ms. Giuffre has produced volumes of



14   papers of tax returns filed with the Australian government, the



15   country where she has predominantly resided since she was 19



16   years old.  And that's all I'm going to say for that, to keep



17   it brief.



18            MR. CASSELL:  Your Honor, I'm just going to address



19   all of the points that -- I'll just take very few minutes here,



20   with your permission.



21            So on point number 7 that I addressed, the issue of



22   slut, it seems like we're in agreement that that should be a



23   term that's not used.



24            The debate was over the term prostitute.  Again, Dr.



25   Esplin, their own expert, you can see in the 702 motions, he

     H3VOGIU1



 1   concluded that was an inappropriate word.



 2            The only -- let me be clear.  If there's some document



 3   that has the word prostitute in it, we're not suggesting that



 4   then it would be -- if that document is in evidence and the use



 5   of that word is appropriate and admissible and relevant, we're



 6   not saying that that has to be redacted.  But the only example



 7   they gave is there's some comments in some internet chat room



 8   somewhere, we're not sure exactly how they're going to



 9   authenticate those, there's no evidence Ms. Giuffre has heard



10   of those, so as you say, we can take that up at the time.  But



11   we would ask that defense counsel be instructed, and their



12   witnesses be instructed, not to use that term unless it appears



13   in a particular document.



14            With regard to item 14, this is the domestic violence



15   issue.  And they say, look, it has relevance because it shows



16   an alternative cause of emotional distress damages.



17            Our position is primarily based on Rule 403.  We



18   conceded, I think, that there's some arguable chain of



19   relevance that perhaps could be teased out here, but let's



20   understand, this domestic violence incident took place in



21   March, 2015, and the statement at issue that caused the



22   worldwide reputational damages was launched in January of 2015.



23            So the relevance here is marginal, and ultimately the



24   question your Honor has to, of course, sort out is the



25   prejudicial effect.  There wasn't any response that I heard



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3VOGIU1



 1   from defense counsel about a blame the victim mindset that the



 2   jury would very well adopt once they heard that Ms. Giuffre's



 3   staying with her husband is a victim of domestic violence.  So



 4   your Honor has in front of it, I think, essentially uncontested



 5   evidence, or at least uncontested argument of substantial



 6   prejudicial effect that will exist that tips decisively in



 7   favor of excluding this, particularly when they get to subjects



 8   like criminal proceedings.  We're going to then get into what



 9   is the scope of the protective order if they live in Australia



10   and things like that.  That's far afield from any effect on



11   emotional distress damages.



12            Item 15 has to do the 17-year-old, 16-year-old,



13   15-year-old.  I think we have agreement from both sides that



14   sex with a 17-year-old is unlawful under the age of consent



15   statute that exists in Florida, and we'll be asking either to



16   cover that through an expert witness or through a jury



17   instruction.  But they say, oh, what if she's flown to New



18   Mexico?  The age of consent there might be different.  And this



19   is where I believe your Honor can take a close look at the



20   expert witness on sex trafficking, the 702 motion is currently



21   pending in front of you, Professor Terry Conan, who is at the



22   Florida State Trafficking Institute, and we've offered him as



23   an expert witness.



24            If you take a 17-year-old from Florida, fly her to New



25   Mexico for sexual purposes, it makes no difference what the age

     H3VOGIU1



 1   of consent is at that point because you have a federal sex



 2   trafficking crime that has been committed.



 3            The same thing is true if you fly a 17-year-old into



 4   London, or if you fly her into New York.  All of those are sex



 5   trafficking crimes, and Professor Conan is prepared to explain



 6   both that particular aspect, I would describe it as a mixed



 7   question of fact and law, and also some of the psychological



 8   techniques that are used to create the -- I think he refers to



 9   them as the invisible chains of sex traffickers.



10            So we either have a crime in Florida, because she's



11   under the age of consent, or we have a federal or, in all



12   likelihood, state trafficking offense if she's flown to another



13   state.



14            Which regard to item 18, the Cassell and Edwards



15   litigation, I think your Honor asked some excellent questions



16   on that.



17            We were told that there are five reasons why



18   Ms. Giuffre's connection to that case has some relevance.  The



19   first argument, I guess, is their strongest argument, was that,



20   well, she was a witness in that case.  But, of course, that was



21   a confidential deposition, so it couldn't have anything to do



22   with reputational damages or something else.



23            Let me be clear.  Ms. Giuffre made statements when she



24   was deposed, and if they say, ah-hah, you've said X from the



25   witness stand, but last year when you were deposed you said not



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3VOGIU1



 1   X, fair enough, cross examine her about it, inconsistent



 2   statement.  We're not objecting to that aspect of that.



 3            What we don't want is the lawsuit itself and the



 4   circumstances surrounding the lawsuit to be paraded in front of



 5   jury.  If they simply want to put in a deposition statement to



 6   stay it's inconsistent, and that's properly done, of course,



 7   that would be appropriate.



 8            Their second point is, she participated for a period



 9   of time.  I guess she participated if you're subpoenaed as a



10   witness and testified, but that wasn't -- you know, she wasn't



11   a party to the case.



12            Their third point was that the reputational damages



13   somehow link into what Dershowitz was saying.  Again, your



14   Honor already knows our point one is to keep out Mr. Dershowitz



15   from the case, and you'll make a ruling one way or the other on



16   it.  If he's kept out of the case then this becomes a moot



17   point.  But even if you decide he's in the case, well, okay,



18   fine.  Have him testify and do whatever else you think is



19   appropriate.  We don't need to hear all about this unrelated



20   lawsuit.



21            Their fourth point had to do with, I believe, you



22   know, damages suffered by Ms. Giuffre.  Your question was, if



23   I'm -- I don't have the transcript in front of me -- I think



24   you said, well, how does the case itself go to damages?  And I



25   believe this is a direct quote from Ms. Menninger.  I can't

 1   tell you that.  So even the defense counsel when given an



 2   opportunity to articulate the relevance failed to do so, in our



 3   view.



 4            She says -- then her next argument is, well, the



 5   plaintiff's experts are using Dershowitz's statements.  As you



 6   know from the 702 pleadings, no, we're using Maxwell's



 7   statements.  We're only going to be proving a case about what



 8   Maxwell's defamation did to Ms. Giuffre.



 9            And then the last argument was that there was a



10   failure to mitigate damages by suing Dershowitz.  Well, your



11   Honor knows, if a person A commits a defamation, you sue A and



12   you get your damages.  Then if person B does something, you



13   sort that out in a separate proceeding in a separate way.



14   Sacks and others are very instructive on that.



15            The last point they made was that, well, look, these



16   statements were going on while Cassell and Edwards were



17   representing her.  They've shown simultaneity in time, but not



18   simultaneity in the scope.



19            It is true that the lawsuit was settled, and I won't



20   refer to myself in the third person.  Mr. Edwards and I settled



21   the lawsuit and made certain statements in connection with



22   that, but that was to take care of our own professional



23   reputation and the lawsuit associated with that, it had nothing



24   to do with representing Ms. Giuffre.



25            I believe I have two left, your Honor, and you've been

 1   extremely patient.  Let me just take two more minutes to cover



 2   point 19.  This is Judge Marra's ruling.



 3            They say we want to put it in that she lost.  Well, in



 4   our view, actually, that was a victory.  Our goal was to try to



 5   get her into the case, and Judge Marra ruled that she could



 6   participate by being a witness.



 7            Now, are we really going to try the implications of



 8   Judge Marra's ruling in a pro bono Crime Victims Rights Act



 9   organization ruling?  He ruled on this, but allowed this other



10   thing.  It's highly, first, irrelevant, and obviously, highly



11   prejudicial in the sense that it's going to divert the jury's



12   attention away from the facts at hand here.



13            And again, Judge Marra only ruled on the first of nine



14   reasons that we offered for putting those allegations in.  He



15   said point 1 doesn't work, the others we'll see how things play



16   out.



17            The litigation is moving forward.  I can tell you the



18   government will be responding to our summary judgment motion, I



19   believe on May 15th.  We'll be replying on July 15th, so the



20   litigation continues.



21            The last point that I'll make is Boylan.  This is item



22   20.  Remember, Dershowitz is going to say that Boylan says that



23   Ms. Giuffre said certain things.  And we were told that, well,



24   maybe she will be a witness.



25            It's my understanding that Boylan is not on the final

 1   pretrial witness list.  Maybe during a break I can confirm



 2   that.  But if she's not on the witness list, we've got double



 3   hearsay and it can't come in.



 4            The last point I would leave you with, your Honor, is



 5   many of these issues are going to come down to balancing.



 6   They're of minimal relevance for the reasons we've explained,



 7   very significant prejudice, and we would ask that each of the



 8   motions in limine we've asked today be granted.



 9            THE COURT:  Thank you.  We'll resume at 1:30, and I



10   guess, unless you all think it's been covered, the Maxwell



11   motions.  What do you think?



12            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, I would --



13            THE COURT:  Would you rather catch your plane?



14            MR. PAGLIUCA:  No.  I'm prepared to stay until



15   tomorrow, your Honor.  I'm not leaving until tomorrow morning,



16   just in case you need me this afternoon.  I'm sure you're



17   thrilled about that.



18            I think, your Honor, when I went through these, it



19   seems to me that we have dealt with number 679, 716, in



20   connection with 683, 742, and 774.  That deals with the



21   Rodriguez, we call it the unauthenticated hearsay document from



22   a suspect source.  They call it the black book.  I think the



23   Court heard argument about all of that and, in my view, this



24   does not all need to be repeated today.



25            Yesterday, we talked about the -- I can't remember the



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

 1   name of it, but it was the plaintiff's motion, sort of omnibus



 2   related to different acts either under 404(b) or 415.



 3            The plaintiff wanted until 15 days before trial to



 4   make whatever showing they wanted.  It would make sense --



 5   well, in defendant's 404(b) motion, there are some of those



 6   issues, as well.  We certainly could argue part of that.  The



 7   Court may want to defer that to the entirety of when we have



 8   whatever the supplement is to that motion yesterday.



 9            Then we also, I believe, dealt with yesterday the



10   issue related to the Jane Doe 102 complaint.  We have a



11   competing motion on that.  That's 663.  It seems to me that was



12   argued yesterday, and we don't need to repeat those arguments,



13   which is the same argument we had yesterday.



14            So in my view, your Honor, that leaves the bifurcated



15   trial motion, which has been fully briefed, the Kellen and



16   Marcinkova issue, and the police report issue.  So by my count,



17   we have those three.



18            I also have on my calendar that our motion to



19   preclude -- or the plaintiff's motion to preclude calling



20   attorneys as witnesses, which is 685 and 772, and by my



21   calendaring the reply was due yesterday.  I think Ms. McCawley



22   has a different version of that, and so frankly, I don't care



23   whether we hear that today or some other time.



24            So that's my accounting of what we have ripe for



25   argument today, or shouldn't have argument today, as the case

 3            THE COURT:  Who's up?  I think the defense?



 4            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Yes, your Honor.  I think Ms. Schultz



 5   requested that we take up No. 666 at this point, which we're

 7            THE COURT:  Oh, yes.  Yes.



 8            MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, this motion relates to our



 9   request that we exclude evidence barred as a consequence of



10   plaintiff's summary judgment concessions.  We asked in argument



11   4 of our summary judgment motion for partial summary judgment



12   with respect to the oral statement on January 4th to a



13   reporter.



14            THE COURT:  Hold the phone.

19   with respect to our client's statement on a New York street



20   that, I am referring to the statement that we made.  As we



21   set forth in our summary judgment brief, this Court's ruling in



22   Adelson v. Harris is directly on point, that a mere reference



23   to another writing that contains defamatory statements does not



24   constitute an actionable repetition or republication.  In that

 1   statement and later a press release which said, we stand by



 2   everything we said.  It's directly on point.  Your Honor there



 3   held that such republication is not actionable.  We set forth



 4   that clearly in our argument 4 of the summary judgment motion,



 5   and plaintiff, in her response to summary judgment, made



 6   absolutely no reference, no response, nothing with respect to



 7   that argument.  We, therefore, believe that she has conceded



 8   the point and we would ask that no evidence regarding that



 9   statement be entered in the trial.



10            We predicted, and we were correct, that having not



11   argued it in response to our summary judgment motion, they



12   would try to use the opportunity of their response to this



13   motion in limine to make substantive arguments.  They should



14   not be permitted to do so, your Honor.  In any event, their



15   arguments that they have set forth in response --

17   But the partial summary judgment, that's not been dealt with,

10            MS. MENNINGER:  Exactly.  That in that statement, our



11   client said, we stand by the statement, or, I am referring to



12   the statement that we made.



13            THE COURT:  Yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  I'm just trying to



14   figure it out.  So in a very nice, polite way, you're telling



15   me I failed to deal with that motion of yours.

18            MS. MENNINGER:  Still out there.  There was no



19   response by plaintiff to that argument is our point; that in



20   their response to summary judgment, they didn't mention it at



21   all.



22            THE COURT:  Well, that's probably where I missed it.



23            MS. MENNINGER:  Exactly.  So I think the fact that



24   they failed to respond to it then, as your Honor has held in

 1   And so their failure to respond --



 2            THE COURT:  What was the point, that that was not



 3   another defamation?



 4            MS. MENNINGER:  Exactly.  In the case of Adelson v.



 5   Harris, just like in this case, there was one allegedly



 6   defamatory statement afterwards.  There was a press release



 7   issued that stated, we stand by everything we said.  Those



 8   facts are very similar to ours, where there was a written



 9   statement issued and then our client, did she or did she not



10   republish that, is that a separate defamatory event.



11            THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, at least



12   in this little small part of this dispute, I know where I am.



13   Okay.  Thanks.



14            MS. MENNINGER:  And the Adelson case, your Honor,



15   controls and says that referring back to a statement, such as a



16   previous press release, is not actionable, and summary judgment



17   has been granted on such alleged republications.  So now, in



18   this motion in limine, is not the time to be dealing with the



19   substantive point that plaintiff basically conceded during



20   summary judgment.



21            Thank you.



22            MS. SCHULTZ:  Hi, your Honor.  Meredith Schultz,



23   counsel for Ms. Giuffre.



24            This motion in limine has already been decided by this



25   Court's summary judgment order, thereby rendering it moot in



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   its entirety.  Accordingly it should be summarily denied as



 2   moot.



 3            This motion should also be denied because it advances



 4   the exact same arguments defendant advanced in her summary



 5   judgment motion.  She is seeking rehearing on her summary



 6   judgment motion, dressed up as a motion in limine.  Many courts



 7   in this district have summarily denied motions in limine that



 8   seek to relitigate arguments from summary judgment, and I have



 9   listed six such cases on pages 7 and 8 of our response in



10   opposition.  You ordered nine defendant's motions for summary



11   judgment.  This Court rejects the argument that she should have



12   partial summary judgment on the January 4th statement.  The



13   last sentence of that order states, Because of the existence



14   of triable issues of material fact rather than opinion and



15   because the prelitigation privilege is inapplicable, the motion



16   for summary judgment is denied.  Defendant's reiteration of



17   her defamatory press release confirming it two days later is



18   something that this Court did not rule that that is not



19   actionable.  So she's seeking rehearing.



20            Also importantly, your Honor, Ms. Giuffre opposed



21   summary judgment on defendant's defamation in its entirety.



22   She opposed the motion for summary judgment in its entirety,



23   and this statement, as part and parcel of defendant's



24   defamation and part and parcel of defendant's motion for



25   summary judgment.

 1            THE COURT:  Well, what do you say about the case



 2   that's been cited?



 3            MS. SCHULTZ:  Well, about Adelson?  I would say that



 4   it's factually distinguished because here she is two days later



 5   reiterating her defamatory statement.  And I would also direct



 6   you to the case in my brief, Wheelings v. Iacuone.



 7            THE COURT:  Let me just get the time frame right.



 8            MS. SCHULTZ:  Sure.



 9            THE COURT:  The initial statement is January, and when



10   is this?



11            MS. SCHULTZ:  So, your Honor, the email that went to



12   the media, it was first issued on January 2, 2015; it was



13   published on January 3, 2015; and the statement took place the



14   next day, on January 4, 2015.



15            THE COURT:  Okay.



16            MS. SCHULTZ:  A recent opinion in this district, the



17   Wheelings case, makes it clear that you can't reargue summary



18   judgment on a motion in limine and also makes it clear that you



19   can't say, oh, because one person --



20            THE COURT:  The issue is, was the second statement



21   defamatory?



22            MS. SCHULTZ:  I think that was an issue at summary



23   judgment that Ms. Giuffre opposed in its entirety, and I think



24   that's already been resolved.



25            THE COURT:  How?

 1            MS. SCHULTZ:  Because it was denied, your Honor.



 2            THE COURT:  The motion was -- well, okay.



 3            MS. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, even assuming, arguendo,



 4   that this is not cause of action, it should still be admitted



 5   as evidence.  This is a motion in limine to exclude it as



 6   evidence.



 7            THE COURT:  All right.  Assume for the moment that the



 8   case that counsel has given me is accurate, and then why would



 9   it get in?  What does it add?



10            MS. SCHULTZ:  It adds state of mind, defendant's state



11   of mind in issuing --



12            THE COURT:  The state of mind didn't change in two



13   days.



14            MS. SCHULTZ:  Right.  It says that she stood by her



15   statement and did not retract it.



16            THE COURT:  Well, she certainly is standing by it



17   today.



18            MS. SCHULTZ:  And your Honor, it shows one other



19   thing.  Throughout this litigation defendant has tried to argue



20   that defendant had nothing to do with the defamatory



21   statements.  In fact, just yesterday defendant's counsel was



22   saying that it was issued by her lawyer and by her press agent.



23   It's her statement, and in this video she is personally owning



24   it, and she can't hide behind her lawyer or her press agent.



25            THE COURT:  Oh, okay, okay, okay.

 1            MS. SCHULTZ:  So it goes to a material argument that



 2   defendants have advanced.



 3            THE COURT:  So to the extent that becomes an issue,



 4   and that's a whole other thing, as to whether she intended the



 5   statement, I can see that.



 6            Okay.  All right.  Anything else?



 7            MS. SCHULTZ:  Yes.  I'm just going to say that this is



 8   a motion in limine and there are no evidentiary problems with



 9   this piece of evidence.  This is the defendant herself on



10   camera, this is not hearsay, and there's no Federal Rule of



11   Evidence that should exclude this.



12            THE COURT:  Okay.  Do you want to add anything?



13            MS. MENNINGER:  No, thank you, your Honor.



14            THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.



15            What else?



16            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, we can take up the



17   bifurcation issue that's presented in 662 and 766, and then



18   there was a reply filed last evening.



19            THE COURT:  Yes.



20            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, I think -- well, I don't



21   think.  The law is very clear on this issue in this circuit.



22   There is a --



23            THE COURT:  Well, I think we can shorthand this.



24            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Yes.

 1   on the liability case.  That's your position.



 2            MR. PAGLIUCA:  That is my position, your Honor.



 3            THE COURT:  I think that's correct.  Tell me why



 4   that's wrong.



 5            MR. CASSELL:  All right.  Thank you, your Honor.



 6            The problem, as usual, is, yeah, her net worth doesn't



 7   come in at the liability stage, but I think the defendant is



 8   trying to get the camel's nose under the tent and say, oh, if



 9   financial issues don't come in, then you can't --



10            THE COURT:  Well, I don't know what financial issues



11   you mean.  He's saying no introduction of her finances -- that



12   is, how much money she's got or where it comes from or anything



13   like that comes in.



14            MR. CASSELL:  As I understand the motion, it's with



15   reference to her financial status.



16            THE COURT:  Well, I just told you what I think that



17   means.



18            MR. CASSELL:  Right.  And I think, with the



19   construction that you were just giving, I'm not sure that we're



20   concerned about this, but let me be clear.



21            THE COURT:  What would you like to present?



22            MR. CASSELL:  There were three or so things we would



23   like to present.  If your Honor rules that Ms. Giuffre's tax



24   compliance can go to her credibility, then we would like to be



25   able to reciprocally say, all right, then Ms. Maxwell's tax

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   compliance, if there is questions about that, could be



 2   introduced.  We think that there shouldn't be tax compliance



 3   issues coming in with regard to Ms. Giuffre.  They've said,



 4   well, that goes to her credibility.  What's good for



 5   Ms. Giuffre should be good for the defendant.  But again, to be



 6   clear, we don't want to turn this into a tax trial; we want it



 7   to be a defamation trial.  But they've made an argument, tax



 8   issues are relevant to Ms. Giuffre.  Then we would like to have



 9   a parallel opportunity then with respect to Ms. Maxwell.



10            The other thing we have, for example, we're alleging



11   there's a organization that is paying girls to give sex to



12   Epstein.  And who's making the payments?  Well, Ms. Maxwell,



13   among others.  We have her on bank records, at the Epstein



14   mansion, where she's in charge of the --



15            THE COURT:  Well, that's different.



16            MR. CASSELL:  Yes, and that's exactly --



17            THE COURT:  That's not her financial status.



18            MR. CASSELL:  Right.  So that's not her financial



19   status.  For example, we want to show those kinds of payments.



20   We also want to show more broadly that Ms. Giuffre and the



21   other girls were not coming into a bungalow in the middle of



22   Hoboken or whatever.  They were coming into a mansion in one of



23   the most --



24            THE COURT:  Well, that's got nothing to do with her



25   financial status.

     H3v1giu2



 1            MR. CASSELL:  All right.  Well, we thought, when we



 2   filed our response, they continued to oppose it.  If they had



 3   just stipulated, you know, I wouldn't be taking your Honor's



 4   time.



 5            But this is where I think they're taking a narrow



 6   uncontested principle, that her net worth doesn't come in, and



 7   are going to try to use it to exclude evidence that Ms. Maxwell



 8   is making payments to the girls, that this mansion is a very --



 9            THE COURT:  Well, okay.  I don't think so.



10            MR. CASSELL:  Let me just make sure that I have on the



11   table the things that we want to introduce.



12            For example, Mr. Epstein purchased a helicopter for



13   Ms. Maxwell, and they might say, oh, well, that shows financial



14   status or something.  We think that shows a very close



15   connection.



16            Well, the last one and perhaps the most controversial



17   one in connection with this case is the townhouse.  It is our



18   belief that a --



19            THE COURT:  Well, wait a minute.  What's the basis of



20   your belief?



21            MR. CASSELL:  The basis for our belief is, I believe



22   they've conceded that there was a sale of a $17 million



23   townhouse in 2016.



24            THE COURT:  Okay.  Is it the defendant's townhouse?



25            MR. CASSELL:  Yes.  So the question is --

     H3v1giu2



 1            THE COURT:  So that's part of her net worth.  I mean,



 2   that's part of the financial part.  I don't see how that gets



 3   into the liability case.



 4            MR. CASSELL:  Right.  So Epstein was the one who



 5   provided the loan to get that --



 6            THE COURT:  Says who?



 7            MR. CASSELL:  Ms. McCawley, who took Maxwell's



 8   deposition, is advising me that during Maxwell's deposition,



 9   she conceded that.



10            THE COURT:  Well, all right.  Okay.  But that isn't



11   financial information.  That's the relationship between Maxwell



12   and Epstein.



13            MR. CASSELL:  Right.  I think you and I are on the



14   same page.  My concern is that we may, as on other issues, may



15   not be on the same page with the defendant.



16            THE COURT:  I don't think so, but maybe I'm wrong.



17            MR. CASSELL:  There's one other point, if I can just



18   be heard on the townhouse.  The townhouse was sold at a time



19   shortly after Ms. Maxwell is discussing with her advisers, hey,



20   I could get sued for libel.  We believe that transferring



21   $17 million outside the jurisdiction of your Honor --



22            THE COURT:  Tell me about that after you've got a



23   verdict.



24            MR. CASSELL:  All right.  But we want to introduce it



25   during the trial to show consciousness of guilt, that she is

 1   transferring assets away from the jurisdiction of the court



 2   because --



 3            THE COURT:  She sold the house.



 4            MR. CASSELL:  Right.  After she wrote an email that



 5   said, hey, I could get --



 6            THE COURT:  You can't argue, I don't think, that



 7   that's an admission.



 8            MR. CASSELL:  We believe it goes to consciousness of



 9   guilt, and we've cited a case in our brief to that effect.



10            But I think if you have a difficulty with that small



11   piece of our argument, I mean, I think the rest of it is



12   really, you know, the meat and potatoes here, so --



13            THE COURT:  Okay.  Yes.



14            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, I'm going to not try to



15   belabor this, but I have to respond to some of the points, just



16   so that the record is clear.



17            The language that we proposed to the Court about the



18   financial status comes from the very cases that are in the



19   Second Circuit, and that's the words that the Second Circuit



20   and district courts in the Southern District use.  And I quote



21   from Tillery:  No evidence as to defendant's financial status



22   may be presented to the jury during the first phase of the



23   trial by either of the parties to this action.  And the Second



24   Circuit says that that's the preferred method.  Mr. Cassell, I



25   think, knowing that he's losing this battle, then tries to

 1   change it.



 2            But first of all, let's talk about this consciousness



 3   of guilt issue.  And not only the supposed facts behind this



 4   but the law that they cite.  There are references to a New York



 5   Post article that is the --



 6            THE COURT:  Well, that's no good, obviously.



 7            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Of course.  And then there's a



 8   reference to Radar Online.  That's their entire evidentiary



 9   basis for the proffer that they just made to you, your Honor,



10   about this townhome.  It doesn't fly.  And I don't need to



11   spend --



12            THE COURT:  Well, wait a minute.  There was a little



13   bit more.  There was Maxwell saying she got a loan, they say,



14   from Epstein to buy the house.



15            MR. PAGLIUCA:  What she said, your Honor -- and I



16   wrote it down because I looked at the deposition transcript



17   last night.



18            First of all, I think it's important for this



19   discussion, we allowed questions relating to anything financial



20   with Mr. Epstein.  So the one instruction that I gave to



21   Ms. Maxwell during this deposition was, anything they ask you



22   about Epstein is fine.  I'm not going to let you talk about



23   your own personal financial information because it's not



24   discoverable at this point.  And so they had fair opportunity



25   to ask her questions.  They asked her questions about the

 1   townhome, and she said part of it was a loan from Mr. Epstein



 2   that had been paid back, and that's going to be years ago,



 3   before any of the defamatory allegations arose in this case.



 4   That's my understanding of the factual basis here.



 5            So we can I think deal with that particular issue, you



 6   know, if and when it comes up, but what I'm saying to the



 7   Court -- I mean, the Court and I are on the same page -- the



 8   sale of the townhome, the amount of the sale of the townhome,



 9   you know, what did or didn't happen to the money from the sale



10   of the townhome, those are all off limits during the liability



11   phase of the trial.



12            THE COURT:  Well, correct me if I'm wrong.  We don't



13   have any evidence as to what happened to the proceeds of the



14   sale.



15            MR. PAGLIUCA:  We don't.



16            THE COURT:  Oh, okay.



17            MR. PAGLIUCA:  There is none.



18            THE COURT:  Okay.



19            MR. PAGLIUCA:  And the notion that this money went



20   outside of the jurisdiction of the court is pure fiction.



21   Frankly, unless it went to some country that I'm unfamiliar



22   with, I think the jurisdiction of this court extends pretty



23   far.



24            THE COURT:  I think that's for another day.



25            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Right.

 1            The last point I want to make, your Honor, on this



 2   issue of consciousness of guilt relates to the one case that



 3   they cite for the proposition that there is some ability to



 4   have a consciousness of guilt theory in a civil case.  They



 5   cite a Second Circuit criminal case in which the defendant was



 6   a man named Amuso.  This is at 21 F.3d 1251, and it's a 1994



 7   case.  Mr. Amuso was a leader in the Lucchese crime family who,



 8   over a course of time, ordered 14 murders and then absconded



 9   from the jurisdiction during the trial of a number of



10   co-defendants.  And it was called The Windows case here in



11   New York, and you may remember it, your Honor, because it was



12   the Lucchese crime family that was controlling the replacement



13   window unions in the city of New York.  So Mr. Amuso goes to



14   trial, and the government requested and received an instruction



15   to the jury that said not only his flight was consciousness of



16   guilt but the length of the absence of his flight was



17   consciousness of guilt.  And in fact, the Second Circuit



18   reversed that instruction and disapproved it in that criminal



19   case but didn't reverse his conviction because the evidence of



20   guilt was overwhelming.  So the one case that they cite for



21   this proposition in fact is inapposite to the position that



22   they're taking here today.



23            So I think your Honor and I are indeed on the same



24   page here, and I'd ask that the Court simply apply the law in



25   Tillery.

 1            Oh, Ms. Menninger reminds me, your Honor -- and I



 2   think the Court and I are on the same page on this as well --



 3   the tax argument made by Mr. Cassell.  Indeed, Ms. Maxwell and



 4   the plaintiff are not on the same footing in this case with



 5   regard to who put their reputation at issue, who is claiming



 6   emotional distress damages, and plaintiffs are in a much



 7   different position than defendants when it comes to



 8   cross-examinations about these issues, particularly in



 9   defamation cases, because as Ms. Menninger pointed out earlier,



10   under Rule 405, everything that impacts the plaintiff's



11   reputation in the community, including the failure to follow



12   laws, is the subject of cross-examination.  So the argument



13   that what is good for the goose is good for the gander in a



14   defamation case simply doesn't apply when you're talking about



15   damage issues and reputational issues.



16            Thank you, your Honor.



17            MR. CASSELL:  Could I just have 15 seconds, your



18   Honor?



19            THE COURT:  No.



20            MR. CASSELL:  All right.  Thanks.



21            THE COURT:  Next.



22            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, we could next take up the



23   issue relating to the police reports which I have as



24   defendant's motion in limine to exclude police reports and



25   other inadmissible hearsay at 677, response at 747, and then

 1   reply was also filed yesterday.



 2            THE COURT:  Okay.  Yes.



 3            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, these reports, that are



 4   loosely described as police reports, encompass a one-year



 5   purported investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department



 6   into the affairs of Mr. Epstein roughly beginning I think in



 7   2005 and going through 2006.  The detective initially assigned



 8   to the case was a woman named Michelle Pagan, and then



 9   Detective Recarey took over the investigation from Ms. Pagan.



10   There were a number of things, according to the reports --



11   although we don't really have any actual witness testimony,



12   with current knowledge.  The police did a number of things.



13   They surveiled Epstein's house, they did trash pulls, and



14   ultimately they executed a search warrant at Mr. Epstein's



15   house.  And that's sort of the totality of the investigation.



16            I give you that as the backdrop, your Honor, because



17   then next what seems to happen is very curious, in my



18   experience, and was testified to by Detective Recarey.  The



19   police get crossways with the state attorney's office in



20   Florida, and there is a complete distrust between the two



21   agencies.  As a result of that -- and there's a bunch of



22   in-fighting that goes on between these two agencies.  The



23   police make the decision to, in some fashion, turn over



24   everything that they have to the FBI.  And as best I can figure



25   it out, the FBI issued a grand jury subpoena, or the U.S.



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                               109

     H3v1giu2



 1   Attorney's Office, in the Southern District of Florida, issued



 2   a grand jury subpoena for the entirety of the Palm Beach Police



 3   Department's evidence relating to the Epstein investigation.



 4   So as we sit here today and indeed for the last ten years since



 5   2006, the Palm Beach Police Department has not been the



 6   custodian of any of this evidence.



 7            And so that's the factual backdrop to then what



 8   becomes continuing problems with the types of evidence that I



 9   anticipate the plaintiffs are going to try to introduce in this



10   case.  The first is these police reports themselves.  And that



11   is about 87 or 88 pages of documents, depending on which



12   iteration of these police reports someone is looking at.  That



13   essentially runs through the course of the investigation.  And



14   I'm sure things that your Honor's seen before, you know, police



15   officer does something, they put it down on a piece of paper,



16   somebody puts it into a system, and then that's where it goes.



17   But the problem here, fundamentally, with these police



18   reports --



19            THE COURT:  Let me back up just a moment.



20            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Yes, sir.



21            THE COURT:  How are these going to be entered into



22   evidence?  They're not self authenticating.



23            MR. PAGLIUCA:  They're not.



24            THE COURT:  So how are they going to be presented?



25            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Good question, your Honor.



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3v1giu2



 1            MS. McCAWLEY:  Do you want me to address that, your



 2   Honor?  I mean, it's our evidence that we're trying to get in.



 3   Or do you want me to wait?



 4            THE COURT:  Well, you don't know.  The defense doesn't



 5   know.



 6            MR. PAGLIUCA:  There is no way.  There is no way to



 7   present these documents, your Honor.



 8            THE COURT:  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Because there's



 9   no DOJ witness listed.



10            MR. PAGLIUCA:  There is no record custodian at all for



11   these documents.  Detective Recarey in his deposition -- and



12   you have this, the relevant answers to these questions --



13   acknowledged that they don't have any of this evidence.  And so



14   that's going to be, you know -- you have seen, in multiple



15   filings from the plaintiffs, they attach excerpted documents



16   containing what they say are phone messages secured from the



17   trash pulls.  So that would be an example of evidence for which



18   there is no record custodian.  Frankly, I don't know who the



19   source of any of that information is.  This is yet another



20   piece of information that has appeared, I'm presuming through



21   Mr. Edwards getting it somehow, you know, in relation to some



22   other case and then it appears in discovery in this case.  And



23   what it looks like is, you know, a number of, you know, what



24   they say are photocopies of message pads from Epstein's trash.



25   But there is no person who will say, this particular piece of



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                               111

     H3v1giu2



 1   paper came from Epstein's trash in the first instance.  There



 2   is no person that will say, we kept these documents and we have



 3   the originals and you can come look at them and you can test



 4   them and feel them.  There is no person that will say any of



 5   that because it went to the grand jury and presumably, under



 6   Rule 60, it's never coming out of the grand jury again.



 7            So the other point about these message pads is, I



 8   don't to this day know whether that's just hand-picked portions



 9   of whatever plaintiff's counsel got years ago or it's the



10   entirety of what, you know, Palm Beach did or didn't do, but



11   when I asked Detective Recarey those questions in his



12   deposition, he said, I can't tell you if that's everything.  I



13   just got handed this stuff by plaintiff's counsel, you know, in



14   the course of this deposition, and that's all I can tell you



15   about it.  So that's another piece of this that's problematic



16   for the plaintiffs.



17            There's another issue that relates to a transcript of



18   a witness, Ms. Hall, and the plaintiffs, I think, want to try



19   to introduce that transcript or, alternately, what they say is



20   an audio recording of an interview with her, and I'm not sure



21   which they are trying to introduce, but there are problems



22   either way.  The transcript, what I will call the Hall



23   transcript, was in fact not prepared by the Palm Beach Police



24   Department.  According to Detective Recarey, he had never seen



25   it before, during his deposition, and he surmised that it had



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3v1giu2



 1   been prepared by the state's attorney's office but he didn't



 2   know.  So what happens then with this transcript is, there is



 3   an attempt at a deposition of Ms. Hall in Miami, this summer,



 4   and Ms. Hall comes in and she sits down, and she doesn't want



 5   to answer any questions about anything, and she says, I don't



 6   remember anything about any of this.  Her lawyer says, she



 7   doesn't remember anything about any of this and she spent the



 8   last ten years forgetting about all of this and she's not going



 9   to remember anything about this.  Mr. Edwards then puts the



10   transcript in front of her and she doesn't look at it.  She



11   doesn't even look at the transcript.  She doesn't turn the



12   page.  She doesn't read any of it.  There's a question asked at



13   some point later:  Isn't it true that everything you said in



14   the police department was true?  And then shortly after that,



15   the deposition ends.  And they're trying to say that that is a



16   sufficient factual basis and an evidentiary basis for the



17   admission of this transcript, which is, you know, unsponsored



18   hearsay.



19            There's a similar problem with this recording because



20   Ms. Hall never listened to the recording, never authenticated



21   the recording.  And so there's no evidence whatsoever that it's



22   Ms. Hall's statement or that it was subject to any



23   cross-examination.



24            So to try to get around all of these evidentiary



25   problems, now what's being advanced by the plaintiffs is, well,



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                               113

     H3v1giu2



 1   we're not offering any of this for the truth of the matter



 2   asserted.  So 87 pages of police reports, a hundred pages or



 3   however many there are of trash, you know, witness transcripts,



 4   no, no, no, no, none of that is being offered for the truth of



 5   the matter asserted, we want to offer it to show Ms. Maxwell's



 6   state of mind when she issued her statement through Mr. Barden



 7   and Mr. Gow.  So the huge problem with that, your Honor, which



 8   we've already dealt with, is, Ms. Maxwell has no knowledge of



 9   what's in these police reports, the trash pulls, any of these



10   things, and so as a matter of law, this can't be part of her



11   state of mind.



12            What is instructive on this point, your Honor, I went



13   and read every single case that plaintiff's counsel cited for



14   this proposition that it is state of mind, and what's great



15   about these cases, frankly, every single one of them, whoever



16   the statement is being introduced on behalf of, or against,



17   knows about the statement.  So when you look at their papers,



18   they cite United States v. Gotti for the proposition that it



19   goes to state of mind.  Well, you know who Mr. Gotti is, and



20   Mr. Gotti was charged with witness tampering.  Mr. Gotti wanted



21   to introduce some wiretapped statements that the FBI had, where



22   he was talking to an informant and telling the informant things



23   that Gotti said went to his state of mind.  Well, the Second



24   Circuit said, yes, you can do that, Mr. Gotti, first of all,



25   because the government's introducing part of these transcripts,



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                               114

     H3v1giu2



 1   and second of all -- so that's a rule of completeness, and



 2   second of all, you were there and you heard it and therefore,



 3   it would go to your state of mind and not for the truth of the



 4   matter asserted.



 5            The next case is United States v. Dupree.  That's



 6   another criminal case in this circuit, where a bank fraud



 7   defendant was the subject of a temporary restraining order



 8   issued to that defendant, okay?  So, you know, he has a



 9   temporary restraining order, you can't take any money out of



10   this bank unless you do X, Y, and Z.  Well, he took the money



11   out of the bank without doing X, Y, and Z, and when he came to



12   trial in his criminal case, the government was allowed to



13   introduce that restraining order because it was his restraining



14   order, he knew about it, and it showed his willful intent to



15   defraud as part of the bank fraud.  So that's that case.



16            Arista Records, LLC v. Lime Group, LLC was another



17   case they rely on.  Again, these are emails that are being



18   talked about that were written by the defendant's employees and



19   then the responses to those emails.  So clearly the defendants



20   LLC had corporate knowledge of those things.  Screenshots of



21   software programs, statements made by an agent of the



22   defendant, those are all the things that we're talking about in



23   that case, and so there's actual knowledge of the entity of



24   those statements, which then can go for state of mind.



25            There are two more cases.  Crescenz v. Penguin Group,



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
