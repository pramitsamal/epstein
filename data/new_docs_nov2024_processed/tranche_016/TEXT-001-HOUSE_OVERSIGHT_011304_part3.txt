 1   and the case says, it's undisputed the defendant had actual



 2   prior knowledge of the issues, of the at-issue statements that



 3   were offered by the defendant.  Again, the statements were made



 4   to Crescenz.



 5            And then the last case is a 1983 case, Tierney v.



 6   Davidson.  That involved civil rights violations and objective



 7   reasonableness by the officers who conducted a search of a



 8   building.  I think the Court knows from doing this kind of work



 9   that pretty much anything in an officer's head is allowed in a



10   qualified immunity case, because whether the officer did



11   something that was objectively reasonable or not depends on



12   what's in the officer's head, and so there is (A) an exception



13   in these kinds of cases, but (B), in fact, the evidence that



14   was being discussed in the qualified immunity situation related



15   to statements that the officers had heard, which formed the



16   basis of why they went into a building.



17            So in each and every one of these cases and all cases



18   that deal with state of mind, the person who it is being



19   introduced either for or against, not for the truth of the



20   matter asserted but for their state of mind, has to know about



21   it.



22            You have attached to our reply an affidavit from



23   Ms. Maxwell who says she's never read any of these police



24   reports prior to January 2015.  And there is good reason for



25   that, your Honor.  It's not easy to get these police reports.



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

 1   As you've heard, the chain of custody behind these things after



 2   2006 is a little sketchy.  And, you know, it requires some



 3   effort.  And so, you know, ordinary folks I don't believe are



 4   going to be, you know, rooting around trying to ferret out



 5   police reports from South Florida.  Even if you get them, they



 6   are heavily redacted, and so when one looks at them, it's



 7   virtually impossible to tell who's at issue, who's saying what



 8   about whom, because there are lots of blackouts through these



 9   police reports.  We managed somehow -- and frankly, I don't



10   even know how -- to get an unredacted copy, and Detective



11   Recarey was surprised when he saw the unredacted copy because



12   he said, we always redact these things.  And so I'm unclear as



13   to how ours is unredacted, but in any event, there is one out



14   there.  But I don't know how we got it.



15            The other point on this, your Honor, is, again, there



16   is some liberty taken in the plaintiff's papers about what



17   Ms. Maxwell said or didn't say in her deposition about these



18   police reports, and they try to make hay over, she knew about



19   the police reports by the selective presentation of that



20   deposition testimony.  And I've cited the actual quote for you



21   in the reply brief, but what is notable, in my view, is that



22   when Ms. Maxwell is presented with these police reports, it is



23   for the first time at her deposition by Ms. McCawley, and there



24   is an exchange in the transcript where Ms. McCawley and



25   Ms. Maxwell are going back and forth and Ms. Maxwell says, you



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   know -- she's holding these police reports and she says, I know



 2   there is a police report.  We go on 300 pages or so in the



 3   deposition, and it is clear from the transcript that when we



 4   get back to the police report issue again, Ms. Maxwell is being



 5   asked questions by Ms. McCawley.  Ms. McCawley says -- and this



 6   is at page 169, lines 4 through 8 -- Now that you have the



 7   police report that I showed you this morning that you had an



 8   opportunity to look at it, and Ms. Maxwell responds, You gave



 9   it to me.  I did not look at it.  And there was no really



10   other questioning at the deposition about Ms. Maxwell's



11   knowledge of these police reports.



12            So the record on this issue, your Honor, which is



13   going to continue to be the record, is that Ms. Maxwell has no



14   knowledge of this police report, the investigation, anything



15   that's going on with Mr. Epstein substantively during this



16   investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department.  So that's



17   why it's not admissible.  They try to cobble together what they



18   view as sort of indicia of she should have known about what's



19   in these police reports, and they first of all say -- we get



20   back to this Dershowitz joint defense agreement issue, which I



21   touched on yesterday, but you're going to hear it again today,



22   so I think it's worth mentioning again.  And here are the



23   quotes exactly from Mr. Dershowitz' deposition.



24   Mr. Dershowitz -- somebody objects during this deposition, and



25   then there's a colloquy.  There's an assertion of privilege.



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   There's a little bit more colloquy, and then Mr. Dershowitz



 2   says:  This is a long time ago.  My recollection is that very



 3   early on there was a joint defense agreement between several of



 4   the people who were of interest to the district attorney and to



 5   the federal government.  That's my recollection.  And I would



 6   only want to resolve doubts in favor of privilege.  Then



 7   Mr. Dershowitz says:  We can check further.  I would be happy



 8   to answer the question if it's not privileged.  That's the



 9   testimony that they say supports their assertion of this joint



10   defense agreement with Alan Dershowitz.



11            But there's more, your Honor.  Mr. Edwards -- again,



12   who is a party in this deposition and not a lawyer -- chimes in



13   to the special master and Mr. Dershowitz:  Q.  Ghislaine



14   Maxwell was never the target of the investigation, was she?



15   Confirming and arguing that Dershowitz is wrong about this



16   joint defense agreement at the time.  And Dershowitz is



17   admitting that he doesn't really know and we should check and



18   we'll get back and people can ask these questions if I'm wrong



19   about this agreement.



20            They also take liberty with Ms. Maxwell's discussion



21   in her deposition about her knowledge about what happened to



22   Mr. Epstein and what he pled guilty to.  When you look at those



23   pages of the transcript, you know, she says, I know he went to



24   jail, and then there's a back-and-forth between Ms. McCawley



25   and Ms. Maxwell about what did he go to jail for, and



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                               119

     H3v1giu2



 1   eventually Ms. Maxwell says, you know, I'm not really sure what



 2   he went to jail for.  It had something to do with, she



 3   thinks -- Ms. Maxwell -- teenage prostitution or under-age



 4   prostitution or something like that.  That certainly doesn't



 5   give you the ability then to ram in 400 pages of uncorroborated



 6   hearsay under the idea that somehow this is notice to somebody.



 7            And I think there is one other factual claim that they



 8   make about, you know, what Ms. Maxwell should have known, which



 9   is not the standard.  It is not incumbent upon an individual



10   defendant to go investigate things.  That's not the standard.



11            It seems to me that they have conceded that these



12   documents are hearsay because they're saying, we're not



13   offering them for the truth of the matter asserted; we want to



14   offer it for this knowledge theory that we have.



15            So I've briefed the issue about business records,



16   which they are not.  I've briefed the issue about government



17   police records, which they are police records, but essentially



18   the same tests for business records applies to police records,



19   which is, you have to be under a business duty to record the



20   information, and court after court after court after court,



21   across the country, has said, people in police reports, like



22   witnesses, are not under a business duty as part of the police



23   department.  So all of those statements, the second- and



24   thirdhand hearsay statements, are inadmissible, either as



25   government records or police records or whatever you want to



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   call them.  They're just simply inadmissible for the truth of



 2   the matter asserted.  You know, there may be a few things in



 3   these police reports that someone could, if they had a record



 4   custodian available, try to offer into evidence, but we don't



 5   have that here.



 6            And so I think for all of those reasons, your Honor,



 7   this is a very strong motion that should be granted by the



 8   Court.



 9            MS. McCAWLEY:  Good afternoon, your Honor.  Thank you.



10            The reason why they're battling so hard on this



11   document is because it's so critical to the case.  This is a



12   police report that records numerous, over 20, under-age minors



13   saying virtually the exact same story that my client gave about



14   her abuse, over and over and over again.  What they didn't say



15   to you -- they skirt around Detective Recarey.  You have his



16   entire deposition transcript, which we've noted for next week,



17   with all of his testimony.  He took these statements.  We went



18   through the business records exception with him.  He walked



19   through, yes, I recorded this in the course of my work.  We've



20   got it in our papers.  I did this under my duty.  I interviewed



21   these witnesses.  I recorded it, etc., etc., etc., all in this



22   document.  I mean, with every document that's come up, they



23   claim, particularly government documents, this is something



24   that we've found out of thin air and that it has no value to it



25   or trustworthiness.  He sat in his deposition as the detective



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                               121

     H3v1giu2



 1   who handled this entire investigation and walked through each



 2   of those people, your Honor, and walked through how he recorded



 3   it in this document.  So this is authenticated through



 4   Detective Recarey, who is a witness in this trial, on our trial



 5   exhibit list.



 6            To be very clear, this document is so critical because



 7   it mentions Maxwell in it.  It talks about Maxwell's stationery



 8   being at the house, it talks about other issues with respect to



 9   Maxwell.  When I asked her at her deposition and I gave her



10   this document -- and you can look at the testimony, your Honor,



11   we want you to look at the testimony -- she says:  I've seen



12   it.  Later in that deposition, they talk about her battling me



13   over she wouldn't look at certain things I gave her, in front



14   of her, right?  So there was an attitude issue during that



15   deposition that I had to manage.  And that was what was coming



16   up in that section.  It wasn't that she didn't say she had seen



17   it.  But your Honor, we are allowed to put that in front of



18   her, in front of the jury, and say:  Did you know about this at



19   the time in 2005 when you were photographed kissing Epstein on



20   the day the investigation started?  You were working for him.



21   You've admitted that.  You didn't know about all these little



22   girls coming to the Palm Beach house that you were working at,



23   that you claim you were the house manager for?  We should be



24   entitled to get this in --



25            THE COURT:  That is for the truth of the matter.



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                               122

     H3v1giu2



 1            MS. McCAWLEY:  Whether she knew about it.  That's not



 2   for the truth of the matter, your Honor.  That's what she knew



 3   at the time, right, she made the statement, did she know about



 4   all these individuals in the police report, did she know about



 5   this.  So that can be offered not for the truth but to show



 6   whether she knew about it.  Whether she knew that at the time



 7   she was making that statement, it was false, because not only



 8   did my client get abused there but so many other girls as well.



 9            So, your Honor, that's part of it.  And in your order,



10   in your June 20th order, you said --



11            THE COURT:  Excuse me.



12            MS. McCAWLEY:  Sure.



13            THE COURT:  You say the detective authenticated these



14   documents.  He didn't authenticate them in the sense of saying



15   that these are part of the file.  I mean, it's not that kind of



16   an authentication.



17            MS. McCAWLEY:  It is, your Honor.  There are two



18   different things, and I'm jumping around a little bit, so



19   that's my fault.  I'm sorry.  But there are a series of



20   questions -- and I believe it's in our brief but it's also in



21   our designations -- where we walked through with him how he



22   conducted the investigation, how he recorded the information of



23   these witnesses, the interviews of the witnesses, the fact that



24   they were reported in this document, etc., in his testimony.



25   So that's one piece.  And that's why this could come in under



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   the business records exception.  But even if it weren't to come



 2   in under the business records exception, it can come in not for



 3   the truth of the matter asserted but to show for knowledge.



 4   And you say in your June 20th order, Notwithstanding the



 5   questions are directed to reveal relevant answers regarding



 6   defendant's knowledge of plaintiff's allegations, that



 7   knowledge goes directly to the truth or falsity of the



 8   defamation, a key element of plaintiff's claims.  In other



 9   words, what Maxwell knew at the time she's making the statement



10   goes to the truth of the falsity of those statements, and that



11   includes this police report, your Honor, so we believe that



12   it's critical evidence to show that.  And you'll see that,



13   again, she was working for the defendant at the time that this



14   investigation happened.  She has testified to that.  She was on



15   the flights with him at the time this was going on over 300



16   times during that period.



17            THE COURT:  You know, spare me the flights, okay?



18            MS. McCAWLEY:  Sure.  Okay.



19            THE COURT:  I've heard that before.



20            MS. McCAWLEY:  Sure.  I'm sorry, your Honor.  I'll try



21   to cut to the chase here.



22            So certainly, you know, it's interesting, because you



23   heard defense counsel here not too long ago saying that they



24   wanted to get in police reports of an under-aged minor,



25   Virginia Giuffre, from when she was 14, being raped by two

     H3v1giu2



 1   other boys, right?  But now police reports are not allowed in



 2   at all, right?  A police report where I've got the detective



 3   coming to testify about the police report that he took in his



 4   investigation, oh, but that can't come in.  And what's



 5   interesting is, they went through all of our cases but they



 6   failed to look at their own cases, because Smith, which is a



 7   case that they cite in their brief on trying to get the police



 8   reports in, a Southern District of New York case, says that



 9   this can come in.  It says, Statements in a police report are



10   not inadmissible hearsay where, as here, they are not offered



11   for the truth of the matter asserted but for purposes of



12   showing whether the arresting officer had the information



13   giving them probable cause in that instance.  So what we are



14   doing here, your Honor, is putting forth this police report to



15   show whether or not Maxwell had the knowledge of that, which we



16   are entitled to ask her those questions at trial, your Honor,



17   and to utilize this police report in that regard.



18            So, your Honor, it comes in for two reasons.  One,



19   under the hearsay exception, which is the business records



20   exception through Mr. Recarey's testimony, which is detailed in



21   our briefs.  He was deposed for a full day.  He walked through



22   all of these documents in his investigation, and we laid out



23   that, the standard in there.  He testified that it was a record



24   kept in the regular course of his work.  He testified that it



25   was something he had to do in accordance with that work.  He

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   testified that he was the primary author of that and that it



 2   had -- and of course it had the trustworthiness, your Honor.



 3   So we were very careful, because we knew how important this



 4   document was, to walk him through that when we had him at his



 5   deposition.  And again, your Honor, those deposition



 6   designations are set forth for next Wednesday.



 7            THE COURT:  How do we know that this is the total



 8   record?  Or is it the total record?  We don't know.



 9            MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, Recarey testified -- we showed



10   him this document as an exhibit in his deposition, and he



11   testified regarding this being something that he recorded in



12   the course of his own work.



13            THE COURT:  But it's part of the record.  Is it all of



14   the record?



15            MS. McCAWLEY:  Meaning all of the record of the entire



16   investigation?  We have produced that in discovery, your Honor,



17   through the -- we have a FOIA response, which is how we got the



18   videotapes of them walking through the Palm Beach house, all of



19   the other materials related to the investigation.



20            THE COURT:  I see.  Okay.



21            MS. McCAWLEY:  So then, your Honor, we deposed the



22   detective to try, of course, to establish that this was the



23   record to get into evidence.



24            Your Honor, they also mentioned -- and this is



25   actually in the in toto motion, but they jumped to it so I need

 1   to address it, and that is one of the witnesses in here, AH,



 2   who was a minor at the time, also gave a recorded statement as



 3   part of that.  We took her deposition, and they're, you know,



 4   in my view, vastly misrepresenting the deposition.  And you can



 5   look at the quotes themselves, but she testified in great



 6   detail about the activity at the house, verifying that what she



 7   said in her recording and in the police report was in fact



 8   correct.  And she is a witness on our trial list.  She is a



 9   minor who was abused in the same manner that my client was.



10   She was exposed to him on a number of occasions.  And we have



11   her testimony, and we have sought to enter that as a witness in



12   this case.  And again, that's in the in toto motion which I



13   think is being heard next Wednesday, but just to address it,



14   since they raised it.



15            The other issue they raised are the message pads.



16   These have come up from time to time in this case and come up



17   through different witnesses.  Now the message pads come in in a



18   number of ways.  One is Juan Alessi, who is one of the house



19   butlers.  He testified that those were the messages for which



20   they recorded -- we showed him the messages.  Yes, that's my



21   signature.  Yes, this is how we recorded our messages.  He



22   worked at the house.  That was his duty to do those things.



23   Maxwell's on those messages as well, so we intend to ask her



24   about those, you know, were you having three girls come on this

 1   come into evidence because they have been validated by an



 2   employee who works at the home and are things that should be



 3   able to be utilized at trial, and Maxwell should be able to be



 4   shown those and explain whether or not there is some issue with



 5   respect to those statements.



 6            So your Honor, that's all evidence that we do want to



 7   enter at the trial, and certainly we have done our diligence



 8   with respect to the police report to make sure that we do have



 9   Detective Recarey's testimony on it.  I submit if you review



10   that, you will see the reason why that it should come into



11   evidence.  But regardless of the hearsay issue and the business



12   records exception, again, as you said in your June 20th



13   order, the point of defendant's knowledge at the time she made



14   a defamatory statement is very significant in this case, so if



15   she knew -- even if she didn't believe my client, if she knew



16   that there had been a number of other under-age minors that



17   were abused in this circumstance, to call my client a liar in



18   the face of all that knowledge is something the jury should be



19   able to consider.  So that is a piece that is important and



20   relevant to this case.  And you can always give a cautionary



21   instruction.  If you're concerned at any level, as you know,



22   you could add a cautionary instruction with respect to the



23   police report.  But we should be entitled to ask her questions



24   on the stand when she's under oath about what she knew with



25   respect to this very significant document.

 1            Thank you, your Honor.



 2            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Briefly, your Honor.



 3            So first, we're doing a mix and match here of



 4   different things, which I like the rules of evidence because



 5   they're rules and I can read them and they say what they say.



 6            Even if, even if, you had a gold-plated record



 7   custodian from the Palm Beach Police Department come in here



 8   and make all of the findings that you needed to find as a



 9   business record exception or a government record exception, the



10   case law is absolutely clear that second- and thirdhand hearsay



11   is inadmissible through police reports.



12            I use this example because it's a good one, I think.



13   As part of my practice, I represent people accused of crimes,



14   and so we get discovery as part of my practice.  Guess what?



15   That goes into my files and I keep it as a matter of course,



16   and it is a business record of mine because I keep it in due



17   course.  Now that doesn't mean that it simply would get



18   admitted into a trial whole cloth for the truth of the matter



19   asserted, just because it's a business record of mine.  And



20   why?  What's the answer?  Because the statements that are



21   included in the police report, or the discovery that I get,



22   that I put in my file and I keep very carefully as a business



23   record, don't magically become nonhearsay, because the people



24   who are making those statements are not under any business duty



25   to report to me.  And that's what the business record exception



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                               129

     H3v1giu2



 1   is all about.  There is trustworthiness when someone, you



 2   know -- if it was a billing record of mine, that's a different



 3   story.  But the business record exception, 803(6), everyone in



 4   the chain of the hearsay link has to be under a business duty



 5   to report.  So there are cases where officers are allowed to



 6   testify about things that they wrote in their report because



 7   they observed them or another officer told them or it was a



 8   test that maybe happened within the police department.  But



 9   what they're not allowed to talk about, under a business record



10   exception, are witness statements.  And that's what



11   Ms. McCawley wants to try to introduce to the jury in this



12   case -- 87 pages of witness statements from people who we don't



13   know who they are and there's no evidence that they had any



14   association with Ms. Maxwell.



15            Let me finish with this state of mind issue.



16            THE COURT:  But before you do, why isn't it an 803(6)



17   exception?



18            MR. PAGLIUCA:  It could be, your Honor.  So 803(6) --



19            THE COURT:  Okay.  So what you're saying is, yes, the



20   reports could get in, but not the hearsay part.



21            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Exactly.  That's exactly right.



22            THE COURT:  Well, okay.  Of course what the plaintiff



23   would say to that is, okay, fine.



24            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Well, then you're redacting



25   90 percent --



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                               130

     H3v1giu2



 1            THE COURT:  I didn't say redaction.  It's hearsay,



 2   it's not being offered, but of course it is being offered for



 3   the truth of the matter.



 4            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Exactly.  You know, this is a



 5   smokescreen about it goes to Maxwell's state of mind.  And when



 6   you carefully go through these police reports, there is not one



 7   of these alleged victims who identifies Ms. Maxwell as having



 8   anything to do with any of this.  Which is another important



 9   point.



10            What I find curious, again, Ms. McCawley usually says



11   there are 30 victims identified in these police reports, which



12   isn't true.  And when I asked Detective Recarey to go through



13   them with me and identify how many people he said were victims,



14   there were 17.  And so now today she said there were 20.  So



15   she's working her way my way.  But, you know, that's the



16   problem here, your Honor.  This is being offered for the truth



17   of the matter asserted.  All they want to do is get in front of



18   a jury that there was a police department investigation in



19   which Epstein was the target and Epstein is alleged to have



20   done all of these bad things; therefore, you should punish



21   Maxwell because then they're going to say, she was his



22   girlfriend, she had to have known, yada, yada, yada, yada, he's



23   a bad person, she's a bad person, find her liable, and whack



24   her with a big damage award.  That's what's going on here.



25            Thank you.

 1            THE COURT:  What's next?



 2            MR. CASSELL:  The motion on Kellen and Marcinkova, our



 3   motion to get in adverse inference.



 4            THE COURT:  Yes.



 5            MR. CASSELL:  If I can be heard on that, your Honor.



 6            THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Let me go back to where we



 7   were.



 8            Those statements, the statements of the victims, are



 9   being offered for the truth, are they not?



10            MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, I do not believe they're



11   being offered for the truth because what we're saying -- we're



12   not saying whether or not what those victims said was



13   necessarily true.  We're saying was she aware that there were a



14   number -- and they take issue with the number.  I don't see a



15   difference between 17 and 30.  But was she aware that there



16   were a number of other individuals making reports at the time



17   she said my client must have been lying about being abused as a



18   minor.  So whether or not those are true or not, the reports,



19   was she aware that there were a number of reports out there



20   from other little girls saying that they were also brought to



21   the massage room.  And that goes to her state of mind at the



22   time she made that statement where she defames my client



23   internationally.



24            THE COURT:  Yes.  But aware of the reports.  How could



25   she be aware of the reports?  Aware of the girls and the



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3v1giu2



 1   activity, that's the truth.  But aware of the reports.



 2            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes, your Honor, and the reason why she



 3   could be aware of the reports is because she'll -- remember,



 4   her testimony is that she worked for Epstein from the early



 5   '90s until 2009.  This investigation took place in 2006, your



 6   Honor, during the course of the time she was allegedly managing



 7   the Palm Beach home and his active employee, his right-hand



 8   person.  So yes, of course, we should be able to ask her those



 9   questions, show her the report:  Were you aware of this, of



10   these reports?  Were you aware that these reports were made,



11   you know, as part of this investigation?  And then she can



12   answer that.



13            THE COURT:  Well, that's fine.  You could do that.



14   You could show her the reports and say, were you aware of them,



15   but that would not get the hearsay part in.



16            MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, your Honor, and of course we have



17   two other of the exceptions, the business record exception,



18   which we talked about, and we also noticed this as one of the



19   residual hearsay --



20            THE COURT:  Yes, but even as a business record, I



21   think counsel is correct -- under the business records



22   exception, the activities of the cops and what they did, all of



23   that can go in, yes, because they're under a duty, etc., but



24   not the statements.



25            MS. McCAWLEY:  So for example, one of the witnesses on



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3v1giu2



 1   our witness list is AH, who is in the report and she testified



 2   in this case.



 3            THE COURT:  Well, that's a different issue.  And you



 4   said you're going to present her.



 5            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.



 6            THE COURT:  Well, all right.  That's a different



 7   question.  But in other words, you could show her the report



 8   and ask her if she's aware of these reports.  I assume what her



 9   answer is going to be.  And that's the end of it.



10            MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, your Honor, I mean, obviously



11   we'd like to enter the reports under the business record



12   exception through Recarey and through the residual hearsay --



13            THE COURT:  But even if you do that, I don't see how



14   you avoid eliminating the hearsay.



15            Well, okay.  All right.



16            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Your Honor, could I have one final



17   comment on this.  If they're not being offered for the truth of



18   the matter asserted, they're really not relevant to this case



19   is my final point, because if they're not being offered for the



20   truth of the matter asserted, at best it's a neutral as to



21   whether these things did or didn't happen.  If they didn't



22   happen, they would certainly be supportive of Ms. Maxwell's



23   state of mind if she knew about them.  If they're not being



24   offered for the truth of the matter --



25            THE COURT:  Well, it might be material that she knew



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   that there was an investigation.



 2            MR. PAGLIUCA:  You know, she could be asked that



 3   question:  Did you know there was an investigation?  I think



 4   she's going to say no.  I gave you her affidavit in which she



 5   said prior to making her statement, she had never seen these



 6   police reports.  So we all know --



 7            THE COURT:  That's a different question.



 8            MR. PAGLIUCA:  I understand.  But we all know the



 9   answer is, that's in these police reports, and I'm pretty sure



10   she testified at her deposition that she wasn't really aware of



11   this investigation.  All she knew -- I think is what she



12   testified to -- was that Epstein went to jail and she knew at



13   some point he was a registered sex offender.  Those are the two



14   things I think she knew at the end of the day at this



15   deposition.  Anyway, I agree with you that the question, did



16   you know there was an investigation, you know, I suppose you



17   can ask that question and the answer will be yes or no,



18   whatever it is.



19            THE COURT:  Okay.



20            MR. PAGLIUCA:  All right.  Thank you.



21            THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Forgive me for



22   interrupting.



23            MR. CASSELL:  No.  Your patience has been appreciated



24   today, your Honor.



25            I want to address now the Marcinkova and Kellen

 1   adverse inference motions.  We're a moving party.  There are



 2   reciprocal motions both ways on this.  I have the numbers



 3   available, if that would be useful.  I believe 673 is the



 4   defendant's motion and 689 is our motion.  So those would be



 5   the two motions going, obviously, in different directions.



 6            Your Honor is familiar with these issues because of



 7   the Epstein adverse inference motion that was argued I think



 8   two weeks ago by me, and at that time -- I know you have not



 9   yet formally ruled on the motion, but there was extensive



10   discussion about could we just kick this down the road to the



11   trial and see, you know, what Epstein says at that time and,



12   you know, after he testifies, sort out whether there's an



13   adverse inference.  Again, you haven't ruled on that, but I



14   think I indicated at the time that certainly from Ms. Giuffre's



15   point of view, we would have no objection to handling



16   Mr. Epstein in that way.  I want to make clear that we would



17   also have no objection to handling the Marcinkova and Kellen



18   issue in that way as well.  You can put them on via deposition,



19   and then we could sort out in the context of the case with a



20   full record whether an adverse inference is appropriate.  But



21   we surface the issue for you now so it wouldn't be something



22   you'd have to do on the fly in the middle of trial.  And all



23   the allegations, of course, that have been made here, I think



24   it's important to put Kellen and Marcinkova on the conspiracy



25   scheme, if you will.  The top of the conspiracy is Mr. Epstein,



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

 1   his right-hand player then is Ms. Maxwell, and in the



 2   conspiracy, again, in our view -- we understand the defense



 3   will take a differing point of view on this, but in our view,



 4   the conspiracy's next echelon is Kellen and Marcinkova.



 5            And so for example, Ms. Giuffre has made allegations



 6   about certain things.  Ms. Maxwell can't remember or denies



 7   them, so of course Ms. Giuffre then looks to corroborate her



 8   allegations of a conspiracy, and the first person she goes to



 9   is Epstein, and you're familiar with that.  The second and



10   third people that she goes to are Kellen and Marcinkova,



11   because they report immediately to Ms. Maxwell in the



12   conspiracy.  And Ms. Giuffre is going to be talking about that



13   during the course of the trial, and immediately the jury is



14   going to wonder, well, gosh, I wonder what Kellen says about



15   that?  I wonder what Marcinkova says about that?  And your



16   Honor will recall that we went to great lengths to get them to



17   testify.  They were evading service, in our view.  We



18   ultimately had to come to your Honor to get alternative



19   service, and it was only at that point that we were able to



20   have them sit for their depositions.  They sat for their



21   depositions now, and what we hear from the defense, if I



22   understand it, is that we don't have a good-faith basis for



23   asking Kellen and Marcinkova, gee, weren't you a part of this



24   sex trafficking and sex abuse conspiracy?  I think the way they



25   put it in their brief is, all of this evidence shows nothing

 1   other than Ms. Maxwell might have been at the same place at the



 2   same time.  It's just, you know, a happenstance they were in



 3   the same place and that's not admissible.  Well, your Honor



 4   will notice in our opening brief on this, at pages 15 I think



 5   through the next ten pages or so, we've gone through with a



 6   chart and we've said, okay, here's the question we asked, and



 7   then in the right-hand column of our chart we put in the



 8   witnesses and, you know, the flight logs.  I know other things



 9   that your Honor is very familiar with.  This is why we're



10   asking these questions.  You know, the flight logs have been



11   talked about over and over again, but for good reason.  Kellen



12   is on some of these flight logs, and what's up?  Those are the



13   questions that we asked, and of course she takes the Fifth.



14            There are other things as well.  For example, Sarah



15   Ransome testified, I witnessed with my own two eyes Sarah



16   Kellen reporting to Ghislaine in front of me, but I can't



17   remember specifics.  They weren't talking about girls.  I can't



18   remember the specific conversation, but every single person,



19   100 percent, 200 percent, reported to Ghislaine.  Later on in



20   that same deposition -- that was at page 288 and thereabouts.



21   At page 387:  I witnessed the same thing -- all the girls



22   did -- the same thing I had to do was go and report to Sarah



23   Kellen, Leslie Groff, and Ghislaine Maxwell.  Ghislaine was the



24   main lady.  So again, we have an allegation by our client that



25   Ms. Maxwell was a part of a larger conspiracy.  That's one of



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

 1   the central issues, of course, in the case.  One of the things



 2   that was called an obvious lie.  And so we want to bring in the



 3   co-conspirators and ask them, Ms. Giuffre says you were in a



 4   conspiracy and what's your side of the story on that?  And they



 5   take the Fifth.  So there we are.  The question is, are we



 6   going to conceal that from the jury or are we going to present



 7   it to them?  Well, the Second Circuit case that your Honor is



 8   well familiar with, LiButti, sets out the factors that have



 9   determined that issue, and one of the things we hear from the



10   defendant is, oh, it's never been applied in a case like this.



11   I would just direct your attention, as I did during the Epstein



12   argument, to the case of FDIC v. Fidelity & Deposit Co. of



13   Maryland.  That's a Fifth Circuit case from 1995, in which a



14   bank officer was accused of dishonest and fraudulent acts and



15   kind of bogus loans, and the Fifth Circuit allowed Fifth



16   Amendment invocations from the loan recipients to be used



17   against him, reasoning that, well, in this kind of a case, the



18   collusion then is shown by the Fifth Amendment invocation of



19   the participants in the conspiracy there.  Fifth Amendment



20   invocations can be held against someone who's accused to be a



21   part of that conspiracy, which of course is exactly what we



22   have going on here in a civil context.



23            LiButti, by the way, the Second Circuit case, which is



24   controlling in this jurisdiction, favorably cites the Fifth



25   Circuit case in FDIC v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., explaining that

                                                               139

     H3v1giu2



 1   that is one of the reasons why in the Second Circuit they think



 2   this is a good rule of law, because they approve of the result



 3   that the Fifth Circuit reached in that co-conspirator case.



 4            And LiButti then goes on, as your Honor is well



 5   familiar, with laying out four different factors.  The first is



 6   the nature of the relationship involved.  The relationship here



 7   is co-conspirators.  They're in the immediate next echelon of



 8   the conspiracy.  They are direct reports in the business sense,



 9   although this is a criminal enterprise, but Kellen and



10   Marcinkova are direct reports to Ms. Maxwell.  Of course the



11   conspiracy continues.  This is not just at the time of those



12   events.  The conspiracy continues to today, and your Honor is



13   familiar with that from the fact that they were evading service



14   while we were trying to obtain their testimony last year.



15   Eventually they show up with lawyers, a Bruce Reinhart I think



16   is an Epstein lawyer; I think at some point Ms. Marcinkova had



17   Mr. Goldberger, who's an attorney for Mr. Epstein now.  They've



18   both made significant efforts to evade service.  Why?  Because



19   in our view the conspiracy continues to this day.  The



20   conspiracy is trying to conceal what was done to girls in



21   Florida over an extended period of time.  The concealment



22   continues through the efforts not only of the defendant but



23   also through the efforts of Kellen and Marcinkova.



24            But there's more that binds them together even today.



25   Your Honor is of course familiar with the nonprosecution



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3v1giu2



 1   agreement that's at the heart of this case.  Remember the issue



 2   that we were talking about yesterday.  The nonprosecution



 3   agreement says to Mr. Epstein, we will not prosecute you, or



 4   any potential co-conspirators, or, and then there were four



 5   named individuals.  Two of those named individuals are



 6   Marcinkova and Kellen.  So they're bound together and have a



 7   common interest in trying to preserve that nonprosecution



 8   agreement, which means, of course, attacking people who are



 9   attacking the nonprosecution agreement, such as Jane Doe 3,



10   that is, my client, Ms. Giuffre.



11            And that is the first factor, the nature of the



12   relationship there.  Very tightly bound.



13            The second one is the degree of control in which the



14   party has vested the nonparty witness in regard to key facts



15   and the general subject matter of the litigation.  That's a



16   direct quote from LiButti.  And the evidence here -- and again,



17   I won't belabor all of the flight logs and specific evidence,



18   but it's recited, you know, in a ten-page chart in our brief.



19   Kellen and Marcinkova are very tightly bound with the



20   defendants.  They are direct reports.  They are working closely



21   together.  I just quoted Ms. Ransome saying, you know, that



22   that was the person that they were talking to, and so you have



23   a very significant degree of control.



24            The third factor from LiButti is compatibility of



25   interests.  Perfect compatibility of interests here.



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   Ms. Giuffre has said there was a conspiracy involving all of



 2   these individuals.  They're all going to say no, there wasn't.



 3   We'll have a trial on that and hear the evidence.  But the



 4   compatibility of interests is, that team is against



 5   Ms. Giuffre.  Those co-conspirators are all working together to



 6   try to undercut the credibility of Ms. Giuffre.  And of course



 7   they're all hoping that she will lose this trial, which they



 8   will then celebrate as a victory.  Of course if Ms. Giuffre



 9   wins the trial, they will all suffer a defeat because her



10   credibility in making these allegations will have been



11   established.



12            The final factor LiButti directs you to consider is



13   the role in the underlying aspects of the litigation, and



14   again, it's hard to imagine.  I won't say they are the most



15   important members of the conspiracy.  Epstein is the most



16   important member of the conspiracy, but the next most



17   important, after Maxwell, who's the number two position, the



18   next most important conspirator is Kellen and Marcinkova.  I've



19   used the expression before, it's kind of playing Hamlet without



20   the ghost.  We're going to be talking about a conspiracy



21   without the conspirators in the case.  We are trying to bring



22   the conspirators here in front of the jury so that they can



23   hear what the conspirators have to say when asked questions



24   about what they were doing to Ms. Giuffre and what they were



25   doing to similarly situated young girls.

     H3v1giu2



 1            The final point that the LiButti case directs you to



 2   consider is whether admitting the evidence will advance the



 3   search for truth.  And here we have a conspiracy, and I'm using



 4   that term not as a lawyer but as a layperson for this purpose.



 5   Webster's defines to conspire means to join together in a



 6   secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act



 7   which becomes unlawful as a result of a secret agreement.  And



 8   so we want to present the conspirator.  Now we think that makes



 9   the case that this is highly relevant and also appropriate for



10   an adverse inference.  Again, your Honor could wait to rule on



11   this at trial, but we think it's clear-cut now.



12            Of course once you determine that something's



13   relevant, you then have to consider possible prejudicial



14   effect.  Obviously this is a case in which sex allegations are



15   going to be at their heart.  It's not like we have a business



16   dispute where somebody wants to throw in sex abuse.  We want to



17   prove, in a case involving a sex conspiracy, what the



18   conspirators have to say.  And there's no prejudice then to



19   Maxwell in the sense of unfair prejudice.  He can ask whatever



20   questions they deem appropriate as well.  But the absence of



21   the co-conspirators is of course highly prejudicial to



22   Ms. Giuffre.  Naturally the jury is going to wonder, you said



23   Kellen was reporting to Maxwell.  Where is Kellen?  That's



24   going to be the first thing they'll say when they go back into



25   the jury room.  Where are these people?  And that's what



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   they're going to say if we don't have an opportunity to present



 2   them to the jury.



 3            The Court will recall the extraordinary lengths to



 4   which Ms. Giuffre had to go to procure their testimony.  They



 5   finally were able to secure it, and they should be presented.



 6            Also -- I think you'll be hearing these issues next



 7   week -- we used some leading questions during the deposition.



 8   We tried to also use some nonleading.  Leading questions can be



 9   used when?  When you have a witness who's associated with the



10   party on the other side.  Well, we said they're in a



11   conspiracy.  I can't imagine a case where there would be a



12   clearer example of when leading questions would be appropriate.



13            The final argument they made, I think last night in



14   their late replies was that we somehow missed the deadline in



15   taking their deposition.  What they don't disclose I think in



16   their papers is, your Honor will recall that we had to come to



17   you, obtain an application for alternative service, and then,



18   as a result of that, they came in.  We did all these things



19   with the Court's blessing and approval of taking depositions.



20   Those schedules were discussed with opposing counsel.  And as



21   soon as we'd taken the deposition, within approximately a week,



22   we provided the designations.  That was back in February of



23   this year.  There's no prejudice.



24            So for all these reasons, we would ask that we be



25   allowed to present two of the co-conspirators in the witness

 1   box via the video depositions that we've taken.



 2            MR. PAGLIUCA:  I thought I was back to my old days as



 3   a public defender when I started the practice of law, your



 4   Honor.  Now I'm arguing an 801(d)(2)(E) motion instead of a



 5   defamation case.



 6            I think we have to start with the notion that is true,



 7   that this is a defamation case in which Ms. Maxwell is alleged



 8   to have made a defamatory statement in 2015.  In that



 9   defamatory statement Ms. Maxwell does not mention any of these



10   individuals and doesn't mention Mr. Epstein, and so the



11   starting point for this is, this is an entirely different issue



12   than Mr. Cassell and his fantastical conspiracy argument here.



13            If we want to stick to the legal issues in this case,



14   I think we first need to understand that there is actually a



15   specific rule of evidence that relates to co-conspirator



16   hearsay exception, and that is Rule 801(d)(2)(E) of the Federal



17   Rules of Evidence, and significantly, under that rule -- and



18   this is why the cases using Rule 801(d)(2)(E) find indicia of



19   trustworthiness in co-conspirator hearsay statements -- they



20   are made at or during the course or in furtherance of a



21   conspiracy.  And absent that finding, statements of



22   co-conspirators are deemed to be hearsay.



23            So what we're talking about here are not statements



24   purportedly made by any of these individuals in 2000 or 2001.



25   We're talking about statements that they are seeking to (A)



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                                                               145

     H3v1giu2



 1   introduce or (B) adversely inference that are made in 2015 that



 2   had nothing to do with any alleged course of or in furtherance



 3   of a conspiracy.  Any alleged conspiracy would have terminated



 4   years ago by operation of many different rules and law.  So



 5   Mr. Cassell's entire conspiracy theory predicate to this has



 6   nothing to do with the four LiButti factors.



 7            And when we talk about the LiButti factors, you know,



 8   there is really zero evidence that's been presented to your



 9   Honor.  First of all, the relationship now, in 2017, between



10   these individuals -- because that is what the controlling



11   relationship is, not some relationship that happened or didn't



12   happen in 2000 or 2001.  It is the relationship during the



13   course of this litigation, not some other litigation.  And



14   indeed, there is no relationship between these folks.  At best,



15   for a brief period of time, a brief period of time, these folks



16   worked in different capacities for Mr. Epstein, at best, and



17   that brief period of time is more than ten years ago.



18            The other part of this that Mr. Cassell overlooks or



19   doesn't want to talk about is what really is at issue -- and



20   this relates to this close present relationship -- does this



21   witness have some reason to protect Ms. Maxwell.  I mean,



22   that's really the inquiry here.  Is the witness invoking her,



23   in this case, privilege against self-incrimination because it's



24   going to have some benefit to Ms. Maxwell?  Well, there is no



25   benefit to Ms. Maxwell for the invocation of the Fifth



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300


                                                               146

     H3v1giu2



 1   Amendment privilege here because indeed, if these witnesses



 2   were to testify truthfully, the testimony would be beneficial



 3   to Ms. Maxwell.



 4            If you ever get the opportunity to watch the video of



 5   these two witnesses, your Honor, it's remarkable because



 6   there's a lot of eye rolling and facial expressions in response



 7   to the leading questions by plaintiff's lawyers that, in my



 8   analysis -- I may be testifying, your Honor, I must admit.  But



 9   in my observation, it was basically a nonverbal that's not



10   true and then the invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege,



11   and if that gets played for the jury, the jury can see that or



12   you can see it.  At one point Ms. McCawley chided one of these



13   witnesses and said something like, you know, if you keep doing



14   what you're doing, we're going to have to do something else,



15   because she didn't like the facial expressions or the words



16   that the witness was using to invoke the Fifth Amendment



17   privilege.  That's how much these folks could help Ms. Maxwell



18   but can't, and they can't because they're protecting their own



19   interests.  They're not protecting Ms. Maxwell's interests.



20   They're worried that if the plaintiff's lawyers succeed in



21   Florida, they have some threat of prosecution, so they're not



22   going to testify.  But again -- and this is, again, a point



23   that seems to be overlooked by plaintiff's counsel -- these two



24   individuals are indeed named in this nonprosecution agreement



25   by name.  Ms. Maxwell is not, and Ms. Maxwell didn't choose to

     H3v1giu2



 1   invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege.  She shouldn't be



 2   penalized because the people who are concerned and are named in



 3   this nonprosecution agreement can't testify because the



 4   plaintiff's lawyers are trying to undo their agreement with the



 5   government.



 6            Ms. Maxwell has no ability to control these folks.



 7   You know, we certainly weren't going to stand in the way of



 8   plaintiff's trying to take their depositions, but we have no



 9   control over them, in securing their testimony or requiring



10   them to cooperate in any sense.



11            I cite to the Court the case of Coquina Investments v.



12   Rothstein, which I didn't realize until I was reading this last



13   night is ironic because the defendant in the Rothstein case is



14   Mr. Edwards' former partner, who's doing 55 years in a federal



15   penitentiary right now.  But in that case, which is very



16   similar here, the court wouldn't impose an adverse inference



17   against an employer for an employee, even though the employer



18   was paying for the representation of the employee.  And that



19   case is I think significant because the court again focused on



20   the relationship at the time of the deposition and not some



21   prior relationship.



22            I talked about the co-conspirator issue.  You know,



23   that's just attorney argument asserted as fact here, your



24   Honor.  No one has ever found that these folks are



25   co-conspirators.  It's Mr. Cassell's and Mr. Edwards' theory,



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

                             (212) 805-0300

     H3v1giu2



 1   but it certainly is not anything that there is going to be any



 2   real evidence about in this case.



 3            The next two LiButti factors, the next one relates to



 4   any interest in the outcome of the litigation.  Again,



 5   Mr. Cassell has to manufacture some interest here.  These folks



 6   are not defendants in this case, these witnesses.  They have no



 7   financial interest.  They have no ties.  There is no joint



 8   defense agreement.  There is no indemnification agreement.



 9   There is nothing.  They have absolutely no dog in this fight,



10   again, which is no interest in the litigation.



11            There's just really nothing that would allow any



12   adverse inference in this case one way or the other.



13            Finally, your Honor -- well, two final points.  The



14   questioning, you know, the kind of questions that were posed to



15   these witnesses were precisely the kind of questions that have



16   been disapproved in the Second Circuit.  And that's Brink's



17   Inc. v. City of New York, which is in the papers; WorldCom



18   Security Litigation, also in the papers; and LiButti itself.



19   These are not technical objections.  It serves no legitimate



20   evidentiary purpose for a lawyer to come in and simply ask a



21   very bunch of highly charged, leading questions to which they



22   know the witness is going to say, I take the Fifth.  There is



23   no evidentiary ball advanced with those questions, because it's



24   just lawyer argument that doesn't do anything for anybody.  So



25   both sides could ask a hundred questions, they could both be



                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

     H3v1giu2



 1   leading, they could both be exact opposite questions.  The



 2   witnesses would say the Fifth to everything, and then you look



 3   at the jury and you say, okay, now you can impose an adverse



 4   inference against anybody you want to based on the questions



 5   that the lawyers asked.  I mean, that's really what this ends



 6   up being, and it's a waste of time, and it is of no evidentiary



 7   significance.



 8            Then the last point, which I'm just going to need to



 9   correct Mr. Cassell on, the plaintiffs were saying somehow that



10   we were untimely in not designating portions of these



11   depositions which we believe are wholly inadmissible, and the



12   point of our reply was, wait a minute, you didn't designate any



13   of this testimony until after the designation date was over.

 1            MR. PAGLIUCA:  (continued) I don't care about that,



 2   but, you know, I mean, we're going to deal with these issues,



 3   and we'll deal with them so the timing is of no consequence to



 4   me, but I'm not complaining about it, I'm just responding to



 5   it.



 6            But for those reasons, your Honor, you shouldn't allow



 7   anybody to present any adverse inference from these witnesses.



 8   They should not just be part of this trial.  Thank you.



 9            MR. CASSELL:  In reply, your Honor, I think you can



10   just see from the upset there what's going to be happening at



11   this trial.  This is the direct quote from Mr. Pagliuca.



12   Fantastical conspiracy.  That's going to be the argument from



13   the other side.  They're obviously entitled to advance that



14   argument.  But that's what Ms. Giuffre is going to need to



15   respond to at the trial.  And, of course, the jury will think



16   this is a fantastical conspiracy if Ms. Giuffre doesn't even



17   bring in some of the alleged conspirators such as Epstein,



18   Kellen, and Marcinkova.



19            Now, we'll hear that this is somehow a hearsay issue



20   under 801(d)(2).  This is not a hearsay.  There are going to be



21   witnesses in the case, questioned and cross examined.  So this



22   isn't a question of inadmissible hearsay, this is a question of



23   presenting a witness to the jury.



24            THE COURT:  How do you think this evidence is -- it's



25   going to go in by way of either deposition or the depositions

 1   already taken --



 2            MR. CASSELL:  Yes.



 3            THE COURT:  -- or by the witnesses being compelled to



 4   come and invoke and so on?  I think we know how that's going to



 5   work out.



 6            MR. CASSELL:  Right.  I think in this case it's going



 7   to be through the deposition that's been recorded.



 8            With Mr. Epstein, we're going to bring him here live



 9   because we've been able to reach him by subpoena, but these two



10   have been difficult to reach by subpoena, that's why we've



11   taken their deposition.



12            And so Mr. Epstein will testify live, he would invoke,



13   Nadia Marcinkova and Sarah Kellen, the deposition has already



14   been taken.  And in our --



15            THE COURT:  What do you do about the statement that



16   counsel just made about the impropriety of the questions?



17            MR. CASSELL:  Right.  So you can't just say, hey, is



18   the moon made of green cheese and they take the Fifth.  You



19   can't put that in, and Booty recognizes that.  There has to be



20   independent evidence that supports each question that's asked.



21            And so what we've done in our brief, if you look at



22   page 17 of our initial paper -- if I can just illustrate one.



23            THE COURT:  No, that's all right.  That's fine.  I get



24   the point.



25            MR. CASSELL:  Right.  But I think this is a fair point

 1   about the defense.  I'm not sure that they get the point



 2   because we've said here's a question --



 3            THE COURT:  Don't worry about educating them.  It's me



 4   you've got to educate.



 5            MR. CASSELL:  So I would just direct you to our --



 6   we've tried to show, this is not a moon made of green cheese,



 7   we have very specific support for each --



 8            THE COURT:  I hear you.  I hear you.



 9            MR. CASSELL:  -- of the questions.



10            THE COURT:  You've got it in the brief.  I understand.



11            MR. CASSELL:  Right.



12            So with regard to their interest in the case,



13   obviously, they have an interest in this woman who is accusing



14   them of being involved in a sex trafficking and sex abuse



15   conspiracy having her lose this case.  They would be popping



16   champagne corks.  They clearly have an interest in the case.



17            The other problem, remember, under Booty, the question



18   is well, are these witnesses that the plaintiff had some



19   control over?  Is this somebody that the defendant has vested



20   control over these facts?



21            These were direct reports.  I don't think I heard any



22   response to that from the other side.  These were direct



23   reports to Maxwell, and so these are the people who, you know,



24   when Ms. Giuffre alleged that she's involved -- Ms. Maxwell is



25   involved in doing these things, these are the women who are

 1   executing the orders for Ms. Maxwell, and it's not part of a



 2   fantastical conspiracy.



 3            All we want to do is have the jury hear this



 4   information.  We've provided in our brief very specific support



 5   for each of the questions that we want to ask.  We think it's



 6   entirely appropriate that the jury hear what these two have to



 7   say.



 8            THE COURT:  Thank you.



 9            Where are we now?  Yes.



10            MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, by my estimation, we have



11   one motion left, which is 665 with the opening brief.



12            THE COURT:  And what's that?



13            MS. MENNINGER:  It was our motion to prohibit



14   questioning of our client regarding her consensual adult sexual



15   activities.



16            THE COURT:  Yes.



17            MS. MENNINGER:  Do I take that as a go ahead and talk



18   or --



19            THE COURT:  No.



20            MS. MENNINGER:  Okay.  I wasn't sure.



21            THE COURT:  Yes, well, I can understand.



22            How can you possibly know what we're going to do when



23   I don't know what we're going to do?



24            MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, I'm happy to defer this



25   issue.  I believe it is somewhat --

     H3VOGIU3



 1            THE COURT:  Yes.



 2            MS. MENNINGER:  -- enmeshed with some of the other



 3   motions that, based on plaintiff's representation, they want to



 4   put off until another day, so -- until the 15 days before, in



 5   particular, so I'm happy to wait.



 6            THE COURT:  How does that figure -- I'm sorry.



 7   Explain to me how that figures into the --



 8            MS. MENNINGER:  Into this motion?



 9            THE COURT:  Well, these are the things about which



10   they have to give notice.



11            MS. MENNINGER:  Exactly, your Honor.  The issue in



12   this motion, and I'll try to be slightly circumspect, but in



13   this motion, we have agreed that our client can be cross



14   examined with respect to plaintiff, any of plaintiff's



15   allegations, with respect to any other minor victim.  Our



16   client has absolutely denied having been involved sexually with



17   plaintiff or with the minor victim.



18            They would like to introduce evidence of some kind



19   every other acts with other people.  They have not yet



20   specified, apparently, completely, what other acts and what



21   other people they're talking about.



22            THE COURT:  So I think we should --



23            MS. MENNINGER:  Right.



24            THE COURT:  So I think we should wait until we get it



25   all.  Okay.  So that takes care of that.

 1            MS. McCAWLEY:  Your Honor, there's just one more thing



 2   procedurally, if I could indulge the Court while I have your



 3   attention before we all leave.  That would be helpful.



 4            THE COURT:  Don't count on it.



 5            MS. McCAWLEY:  Sorry.



 6            THE COURT:  Yes.



 7            MS. McCAWLEY:  It's just, in your order about the ESI



 8   and the issue with the non-production, you said that we should



 9   suggest hearing dates.  I see that your Honor has moved the



10   hearing dates to Wednesdays, so we were hoping to, since



11   there's only a few Wednesdays left before our trial, reserve



12   one of those to handle that hearing?



13            THE COURT:  Well, I'm not sure.



14            MS. McCAWLEY:  Or whatever day would work.



15            THE COURT:  No.  Okay.  Now, it seems to me, correct



16   me if I'm wrong, on the 5th we're going to do Epstein's motion,



17   the deposition designations, the biforcation --



18            MR. CASSELL:  I'm sorry, we just did that.



19            THE COURT:  By the way, maybe we could do the



20   biforcation issue very quickly.  What is it you want to --



21            MR. CASSELL:  I think we just did that a few moments



22   ago, your Honor.



23            MS. McCAWLEY:  That was the one about the financial



24   records.



25            THE COURT:  By what?

     H3VOGIU3



 1            MS. McCAWLEY:  We just did that about the financial



 2   records, and you gave us some direction on that, so that one's



 3   been --



 4            THE COURT:  Oh, okay.  So that's done.  Okay.  So



 5   that's the 5th.



 6            MS. McCAWLEY:  Yes.  So then there's April 12th, which



 7   I believe is the following Wednesday, and then I think the one



 8   after that is the 19th.



 9            THE COURT:  Well, are we going to do a hearing -- I



10   take it we're going to do a hearing on the reconsideration of



11   the --



12            MS. McCAWLEY:  That's what I'm talking about, your



13   Honor.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  So that's the evidentiary issue of --



14   you said they could present a forensic, based on your order of



15   reconsideration of the November 2nd.  So that's the date I'm



16   looking for.  I'm sorry, I should have been clearer about that.



17            THE COURT:  When are we going to do that?



18            MS. McCAWLEY:  Maybe the 12th or the 19th possibly?



19            THE COURT:  How about the 10th.



20            MS. McCAWLEY:  Okay.



21            THE COURT:  Does that work for you all?



22            MR. PAGLIUCA:  I can't do the 10th, your Honor, I'm in



23   a deposition all day in Colorado.  I'm sorry.



24            THE COURT:  How could you possibly take another case?



25            MR. PAGLIUCA:  Well, believe me, I have a lot of

 1   clients that are saying that exact same thing right now, your



 2   Honor.



 3            MS. MENNINGER:  Your Honor, could we do the 13th, the



 4   Thursday of that week?



 5            THE COURT:  Yes.  I don't see any reason not to.



 6   Okay.



 7            MS. McCAWLEY:  That's all I had, your Honor.  Thank



 8   you.  And thank you for your patience, everyone, today.



 9            THE COURT:  Have we completed the briefing and



10   everything everybody wants to submit on the black book issue?



11            MS. McCAWLEY:  Well, yes, your Honor.  So now, as of



12   last night, it was fully briefed.  So there are three briefs on



13   it, essentially.  We had a motion in limine to allow it in,



14   they had a motion in limine to exclude it, and it came up



15   previously -- I forget, we argued it a couple weeks ago in the



16   context of another motion -- oh, I'm sorry, because, your



17   Honor, you requested that with respect to Diane Flores.  So we



18   didn't reargue it today, it is fully briefed for you.



19            THE COURT:  Okay.  In other words, I've got everything



20   on that.



21            MS. McCAWLEY:  You do, your Honor, yes.



22            THE COURT:  Okay.  Anything else?



23            MS. McCAWLEY:  Not that I'm aware of.



24            MR. PAGLIUCA:  I think we're concluded today, your



25   Honor.  Thank you.
