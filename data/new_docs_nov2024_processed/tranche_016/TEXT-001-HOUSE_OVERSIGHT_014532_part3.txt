through to higher domestic inflation. In turn,
higher UK interest rates would make sterlingdenominated
assets more appealing to foreign
investors and support the currency.
Finally, while sterling certainly has scope to
depreciate, market participants are already wellpositioned
for further weakness. Those positions
may become vulnerable if the UK’s negotiations
with its trade partners turn more amicable and the
domestic UK economy remains resilient.
With these upside risks being tempered by the
unknowable evolution of Brexit negotiations for
now, we see balanced risks for the pound this year
and thus remain tactically neutral.
Emerging Market Currencies
Emerging market currencies caught a welcome
updraft last year, following a 45% freefall since
mid-2011. The flight was not without turbulence,
however. Following a 12% rally in the first half of
the year—reflecting a dovish shift in US monetary
policy and waning fears about Chinese capital
outflows—emerging market currencies hit an air
pocket that erased much of these gains following
the surprise outcome of the US elections.
We believe this downdraft is likely to persist.
The prospect of higher US interest rates, a stronger
dollar and China’s bumpy deceleration spells
tighter global financial conditions and a risk
of capital outflows from emerging markets—
conditions that have historically constituted a stiff
headwind to their currencies.
These risks are magnified by the uncertainty
surrounding the incoming US administration’s
trade policies. Fears of protectionism have already
negatively impacted the currencies of China and
Mexico—the two largest sources of manufacturing
exports to the US—with the peso and Chinese
renminbi down 11.6% and 2.3%, respectively,
since the election.
Even so, we do not think a broad tactical short
in emerging market currencies is appealing at this
stage. Despite the small rally last year, emerging
market currencies remain attractively valued (see
Exhibit 76), particularly given their enticing 5%
yield differential to the US dollar. Moreover, the
new US administration may prove to be more
measured in its actions than its rhetoric—a nonnegligible
risk that could revive sentiment and
improve prospects for emerging market currencies.
The Mexican peso, in particular, could benefit in
that event.
For now, we remain tactically positioned to
benefit from further renminbi weakness given our
long-standing concerns about China’s economic
vulnerabilities and the likelihood of looser policy,
policy mistakes and capital outflows. The potential
for US trade protectionism directed at China,
though not our base case, would further benefit
this position.
2017 Global Fixed Income Outlook
Last year witnessed a notable reversal of fortune
for global interest rates. Despite reaching all-time
closing lows shortly after the surprise Brexit vote,
10-year yields in developed markets had reclaimed
much—if not all—of those declines by year-end.
In the US, a more than one percentage point swing
was sufficient to turn the 10-year bond’s 9% gain
into a loss.
While some have portrayed this reversal as
just another setback in the now three-decade-old
bond bull market, we are more skeptical. The
policy mix that has depressed interest rates in
the post-crisis period—a combination of fiscal
austerity, negative or near-zero central bank policy
rates and large-scale asset purchases—is losing
favor, as even policymakers acknowledge the often
counterproductive impact of these policies. At

the same time, the recovery in commodity prices,
recent firming in global growth and potential for
expansionary fiscal policy are shifting the focus
from deflation to reflation.
This shift in perspective arrives at a time when
the market’s vulnerability to rising rates is the
highest on record (see Exhibit 77). Losses from
these long-duration positions in response to higher
rates could beget more bond sales, creating a
vicious cycle. That yields are still extremely low
by historical standards does little to assuage these
fears. Consider that 10-year government bond
yields in all G-7 countries have been higher at least
90% of the time since 1958. Given all the above,

we believe the ascent of interest rates remains in
its infancy.
Still, it is important to differentiate between
a normalization of interest rates and a disorderly
backup. While we expect higher interest rates over
the coming years, secular headwinds—like aging
demographics and slower productivity growth—
suggest the terminal point of that increase will be
lower than the historical average. This fact is not
lost on the Federal Reserve, which has reduced
its estimate of the long-run equilibrium nominal
rate—the rate consistent with full employment and
stable inflation in the medium term—from 4.25%
to 3% over recent years.
With a lower interest rate target
to reach, the Federal Reserve is likely
to proceed slowly, particularly given
uncertainty around its estimate of the
economy’s equilibrium rate and lingering
international risks. Even if the Federal
Reserve were to raise rates three times in
2017, that pace would still be less than
half of the historical median tightening
pace. 113 Thus far in this cycle, the
Federal Reserve has raised rates only
once per year.

by remaining overweight US corporate high yield
credit versus investment grade fixed income and by
funding various tactical tilts from their high-quality
bond allocation. While most investment grade
bonds may have uninspiring tactical prospects, we
emphasize that investors should not completely
abandon their bond allocation in search of higher
yields. As the last several years have reminded
us, investment grade fixed income serves a vital
strategic role in the portfolio, due to its ability to
hedge against deflation, reduce portfolio volatility
and generate income.
In the sections that follow, we review the
specifics of each fixed income market.
US Treasuries
While 2016 began as a bumper year for US
Treasuries, it ended in a rout. The yield on 10-year
Treasury bonds, for example, reached an all-time
low of just 1.36% by the middle of last year before
jolting higher by more than one percentage point
by year-end. As a result, investors’ nearly doubledigit
gains devolved into a small loss. Even worse,
the bulk of the rate increase occurred in just the
last three months of 2016, generating a 7% loss for
the quarter that has been exceeded less than 1% of
the time historically since 1981.
We expect rates to continue to increase, albeit
at a slower pace in 2017, as many of the forces
that have restrained yields are slowly fading.
Inflation, in particular, has been a persistent drag,
reflecting a toxic combination of excess labor slack
that depressed wages, a strong dollar that lowered
import prices and a significant decline in oil prices
that weighed on breakeven inflation rates. But
as we begin the eighth year of the US expansion,
labor slack has been largely absorbed, evident in
today’s firming wages. Moreover, the impact of the
dollar is diminishing as its pace of ascent slows,
while the recovery in oil is boosting breakeven
inflation rates.
Other headwinds are also receding. The fiscal
austerity among the advanced economies that
has dampened economic growth and decreased
sovereign bond issuance—both of which depress
interest rates—is now reversing (see Exhibit 78).
Indeed, US fiscal spending is expected to add
0.3–0.5 percentage points to GDP growth in each
of the next two years. 114
At the same time, there is reduced demand
for risk-free assets, like US Treasuries, given

geopolitical events—such as the UK and Italian
referenda—and the results of the US election.
Finally, the deleterious impact of depressed interest
rates on banking sector profitability has raised the
hurdle for global central banks to cut interest rates
further and/or increase the scale of QE programs. In
turn, market focus has shifted toward the eventual
tapering of BOJ, ECB and BOE accommodation,
which has helped lift bond term premiums and
boosted long-term yields (see Exhibit 79).
In light of these waning headwinds, the Federal
Reserve is likely to hike two or three times in 2017,
with upside risks from a larger-than-anticipated
fiscal expansion. Combined with some further
normalization in the term premium, we expect 10-
year rates to increase to 2.50–3.00% by year-end.
Given the balance of risks, we remain comfortable
funding tactical tilts out of investment grade
fixed income.
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
TIPS fared better than nominal bonds in 2016,
delivering a positive mid-single-digit return. Their
outperformance was driven by the recovery in
breakeven inflation rates, which began the year at
very depressed levels consistent with only 1.5%
annual inflation over the next 10 years—well
below long-run forecasts (see Exhibit 80). In fact,
our work suggests that breakeven inflation rates
were reflecting high odds of a deep recession over
the course of 2016, well above the risk suggested
by our recession models.

We think that breakeven inflation rates have
further room to rise as the concerns that depressed
them last year fade. First, oil prices are recovering,
reversing the persistent drag they had exerted
throughout much of early 2016. Second, wages are
firming and fiscal policy is being eased, dampening
deflation worries. Finally, recession odds are
falling as the drag from oil weakness and dollar
strength fades.
With breakeven inflation rates still below longterm
consensus forecasts and the Federal Reserve’s
target, we expect positive total returns from TIPS
in 2017. Still, TIPS’ absolute returns are likely to
be modest, as their eight-year duration will make it
difficult for coupon income to meaningfully exceed
principal losses as rates rise. Moreover, given TIPS’
unfavorable tax treatment (discussed at length
in our 2011 Outlook), we continue to advise US
clients with taxable accounts to use municipal
bonds for their strategic allocation.
We expect rates to continue to
increase, albeit at a slower pace in
2017, as many of the forces that have
restrained yields are slowly fading.
US Municipal Bond Market
Municipal bond holders were not immune from
2016’s about-face in US Treasury yields. Last
October, municipal bonds were enjoying some of
their best returns in years, only to be hit by losses
arising from both rising interest rates and budding
concerns about tax changes in the wake of the US
presidential election. The abrupt redemptions of
municipal bond mutual funds only exacerbated
these losses, with the pace of outflows second only
to the mid-2013 taper tantrum (see Exhibit 81).
All told, municipal bonds suffered one of their
worst years in recent history, with intermediate
municipal bonds actually experiencing a rare loss
(see Exhibit 82).
Unfortunately, the near-term outlook remains
challenging. As Exhibit 81 reminds us, mutual
fund flows tend to be sticky in this asset class,
with persistent periods of both buying and selling
depending on the trajectory of interest rates. Based
on historical episodes, there is scope for the current
string of outflows to extend further.
Moreover, clarity on tax policy will
remain elusive for months, during which
time headline risk will be significant.
Even worse, a sizable reduction in the
top individual tax rate for municipal
bonds—if ultimately passed—could
significantly shift the economics of
owning them, leading to further sales.

only add to existing concerns about pension
funding levels.
While there is clearly no shortage of risks, the
silver lining to last year’s rout is that we begin
2017 with a much larger valuation buffer to help
absorb them. As seen in Exhibit 83, the ratio
of municipal yields to Treasury yields is above
average for both 5- and 10-year maturities. In
turn, investors can currently earn an extra 70
basis points of after-tax yield by owning fiveyear
municipal bonds instead of same-maturity
Treasuries—a yield pickup more than double the
post-crisis median of 31 basis points. Moreover,
this incremental after-tax yield would still be
around 50 basis points if the top individual tax on
investment income were reduced by 10 percentage
points—from 43.4% with the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) tax to 33% under new policy
recommendations. In short, municipal spreads
currently offer a potential offset to rising rates and
potential tax changes.
Also keep in mind that municipal fundamentals
remain stable. Major state and local tax revenues
have continued to increase at a moderate 3% pace,
which should be supported by the above-trend
US economic growth and rising home prices we
forecast. Meanwhile, governments have exercised
restraint on capital spending. Consider that net
issuance expectations of $30 billion for 2017 stand
well below the pre-crisis 10-year annual average
of $110 billion. 115 This restraint has not only kept
net supply low—as new issuance has been largely
offset by maturing debt—but has also helped
municipal finances. Ratings trends have improved
as a result of both stable revenue and spending
discipline, with upgrades in the Moody’s universe
seeing a notable uptick in last year’s third quarter
(see Exhibit 84).
Of course, underfunded long-term pension
liabilities remain a source of concern. But with
aggregate funding levels holding steady at around
74%, we do not think this will be a primary focus
in 2017, particularly given last year’s increase in
stock prices. While rising equity values will do
little to remedy municipals’ inadequate funding
contributions, they will help increase the value
of pension assets. Moreover, these medium-term
concerns are not the primary driver of recent
municipal bond weakness. After all, today’s
funding levels are no worse than they were in
October of last year, a time when municipal bonds
were enjoying some of their best returns ever.
All told, we expect intermediate municipal
strategies to gain about 1% in 2017. With
this return close to that of cash but with more
downside potential, we still think it makes sense
for clients to fund various tactical tilts from their
high-quality municipal bond allocation. This
recommendation is motivated primarily by rate
risk and not credit concerns, since we expect
municipal defaults to be rare events. Outside
tilt funding, we recommend clients target their

benchmark duration. Given their important
portfolio hedging characteristics, municipal bonds
should remain the bedrock of the “sleep-well”
portion of a US-based client’s portfolio.
The same can be said for high yield municipal
bonds. Despite their almost 10-year duration, these
bonds currently offer attractive spreads of close to
3%, a level that has been higher only 29% of the
time since 2000. This spread provides a substantial
buffer that could partially offset higher Treasury
yields, enabling the high yield municipal market
to deliver positive returns of around 4% in our
base case. Therefore, we recommend clients stay
invested at their customized strategic weight.
US Corporate High Yield Credit
Even for the bullish among us, last year’s
17% total return in corporate high yield was
surprisingly strong. Not only was it the largest gain
within US fixed income, but it also ranked among

the top annual returns of all time for the asset
class. What makes this performance even more
impressive is that high yield was down about 5%
at its worst point in early 2016.
But these sizable gains have come at a cost.
Spreads—which compensate investors for the risk
of default losses—now stand well below their longterm
average. In fact, the level of spreads has been
lower only a third of the time in the last 30 years.
Moreover, yields have fallen from above 10%
early last year to less than 7% now, diminishing
the allure of these bonds to investors searching for
high returns.
Even so, we think the strong fundamentals
underpinning the asset class still warrant an
overweight, though returns are almost certain to
be more modest going forward. At the heart of
this stance is our benign view on default losses,
which are the primary risk to high yield investors.
Here, several factors support our below-historicalaverage
2.5% par-weighted default
forecast for 2017.
First, high yield firms stand to benefit
directly from the strengthening US
economy we expect this year, considering
almost three-quarters of their sales
originate domestically. 116 Second, leading

experiencing liquidity problems or are at risk of
breaching financial covenants. As seen in Exhibit
85, Moody’s composite Liquidity Stress Index
(LSI) began to deteriorate in advance of previous
default cycles. Third, the commodity sectors of the
high yield universe—which collectively generated
a staggering 85% of last year’s defaults—are
recovering along with oil prices. Keep in mind
that the par-weighted default rate excluding
these sectors was just 0.5% last year, a fraction
of the 3.2% long-run average. 117 Finally, our
default model—which incorporates the leading
characteristics of the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan
Officer Opinion Survey and the percentage of
distressed bonds—is projecting 2–3% par-weighted
defaults in the year ahead.
Other factors corroborate our low-default view.

risk, given that less than 10% of existing debt
matures in the next two years. Of equal importance,
interest coverage stands near all-time highs today,
in stark contrast to the period preceding the
financial crisis (see Exhibit 87). This point is further
illustrated by Exhibit 88, which shows that today’s
high yield universe is much healthier than the precrisis
cohort, regardless of measure. Keep in mind
that low-rated CCC bonds represented just 8% of
high yield issuance last year, a 14-year low. 118
We also note that high yield may be a better
interest rate hedge than many investors realize.
Consider that during unexpected interest rate
backups in the past, high yield has generated a
positive return 69% of the time and a return that
exceeded investment grade fixed income 85%
of the time (see Exhibit 89). This last point is
important, as our high yield overweight is funded
out of investment grade fixed income.
High yield’s hedging qualities were
apparent last year, as the asset class
appreciated nearly 7% in the second
half of the year despite an increase in
Treasury yields of more than 100 basis
points. Although we assume that any
further increase in 10-year Treasury
rates this year will not be offset by high
yield spreads, this historical relationship
suggests that may be overly conservative.

Of course, a more constructive view of high
yield fundamentals does not necessarily suggest
robust returns. In high yield bonds, today’s belowaverage
spreads already reflect our subdued default
expectations and are less likely to offset any further
increase in rates. We thus expect returns of around
4% in the year ahead. Although high yield energy
is likely to generate similar gains, the potential
upside is more significant given wider starting
spreads and the potential for distressed bonds to
pull to par amid higher oil prices. Finally, with a
5% return, bank loans should perform marginally
better than bonds, reflecting their attractive
0.25-year duration and continued investor demand
for floating rates—a feature that is back in vogue
now that 3-month LIBOR is almost above the
1% LIBOR floor that more than 90% of bank
loans possess.
While these returns may pale in comparison to
those of last year, they remain attractive relative to
investment grade fixed income, where we expect
rising rates to generate lower returns. Even if rates
stagnate while US growth remains positive, the
default-adjusted return in high yield should still
trump high-quality bonds. Said differently, US
corporate high yield credit remains a better house
in a bad fixed income neighborhood, supporting
our modest overweight recommendation.

European Bonds
Unlike their US counterparts, European fixed
income markets did not forfeit all their gains by
the end of last year. This served as a poignant
reminder of how divergent monetary policies
can shape returns. Three ECB actions in March
drove this robust relative performance. First,
the ECB reversed its prior commitment to avoid

further rate cuts and lowered the deposit rate to
-0.40%. Second, it increased the size of its asset
purchase program from €60 billion to €80 billion
per month, effectively buying more Eurozone
bonds each year than are actually issued (see
Exhibit 90). Finally, it continued to limit its buying
to bonds with yields above the deposit rate,
which concentrated its purchases toward longmaturity
bonds.
These measures created an extreme scarcity
effect in long-term German bunds, as investors
scrambled to buy today for fear of even lower
interest rates tomorrow. In response, German
10-year rates fell to an all-time low of -18 basis
points in July of 2016. During these same summer
months, all German government bonds with less
than a 15-year maturity offered negative yields.
However, monetary policy does not operate in
a vacuum. With negative interest rates impairing
the profitability of the European banking system,
the ECB has already begun to alter its policy mix.
At its December 2016 meeting, the ECB reversed
the increase in asset purchases mentioned above,
targeting €60 billion per month for the upcoming
March–December 2017 period. Moreover, it lifted
the restriction on purchasing bonds with yields
below the deposit rate, alleviating the scarcity
premium attached to long-maturity bonds meeting
this criterion. While these adjustments are well
short of QE “tapering,” they have shifted the
market focus toward the eventual end of asset
purchases and the timing of the first ECB rate
hike—currently priced for late 2018.
With less ECB policy pressure on long-maturity
bonds, coupled with continued above-trend
Eurozone growth and some further normalization
in global term premiums, we expect 10-year bund
yields to increase to 0.5–1.0% by the end of 2017.
While overall peripheral bond spreads should be
mostly range-bound in 2017, political woes in
Italy and France pose upside risks to the spreads of
those countries.
In the UK, we expect gilt yields to reach 1.5–
2.25%. Here, persistently high headline inflation
induced by the depreciation of sterling and a
less-than-feared economic drag from Brexit thus
far could encourage the BOE to unwind a portion
of the preemptive easing it deployed in response to
the surprise referendum outcome.
Given this outlook and today’s still depressed
bond yields, we remain underweight UK and
Eurozone government bonds for European

investors. After all, just a 2 basis point increase in
German 10-year bund yields generates a capital
loss sufficient to offset an entire year of income.
That said, we should not confuse an underweight
with a zero weighting, as European clients should
retain some exposure to German bunds and other
high-quality Eurozone bonds in the “sleep-well”
portion of their portfolios. These high-quality
bonds would provide an attractive hedge in the
event of a Eurozone recession or the return of
deflationary concerns.
Emerging Market Local Debt
Last year’s 10% return for emerging market local
debt (EMLD) provided some solace to those who
have suffered through nearly three years of losses
totaling more than 30%. But investors had to
endure considerable volatility to realize this gain,
as returns fluctuated between -4% and +18% in
2016. In fact, the asset class lost roughly 5% in just
the last two months of the year.
This last point is important, since many of the
tailwinds that drove EMLD’s strong returns in the
first half of 2016 reversed toward year-end and are
likely to impact the asset class again in 2017. Here,
we refer specifically to the resumption of Federal
Reserve rate hikes, renewed US dollar appreciation
and a resumption of Chinese renminbi depreciation
against the dollar. Just as falling global interest
rates helped the asset class for the first part of
2016, so too should the rising rates we expect

represent a headwind this year (see Exhibit
91). Meanwhile, any boost to emerging market
exports from the modest pickup in global growth
we expect is likely to be dwarfed by ongoing US
trade policy uncertainty, European political risk
and China fears. Lastly, an acceleration of recent
outflows from EMLD markets could magnify these
risks, particularly since 60% of the cumulative
inflows into the asset class since 2004 are
experiencing losses at current market levels.
Although the number of concerns is large, so is
the risk premium of the asset class. As previously
seen in Exhibit 76, the currencies in the EMLD
index are 15% undervalued. From this starting
point, the asset class could deliver attractive total
returns if US trade policy proves to be more benign
than feared and China worries abate.
Considering this balance of risks, our central
case calls for low single-digit returns. While
positive, this return is not sufficient to justify
a tactical long position in EMLD in our view,
given the still considerable downside risks
discussed above.
Emerging Market Dollar Debt
Emerging market dollar debt (EMD) returned 10%
in 2016, capping a surprising four-year period
of outperformance that has greatly benefited
from stable US rates and dollar strength. But the
prospects for a fifth year of upside are questionable
for several reasons.
First, EMD’s almost seven-year duration is
a liability in a rising-rate environment. This is
particularly true now that the Federal Reserve
has resumed tightening policy, a fact evident in
EMD’s 4.3% drop in response to increasing rate
hike expectations late last year. Second, with
spreads standing near two-year lows, there is scope
for spread widening based on US and European
policy uncertainty and renewed China growth
fears. Third, countries accounting for 37% of
EMD—including Mexico, China, South Africa
and Brazil—have negative outlooks from at least
two rating agencies, raising the potential for
downgrades. 119 A potential default by Venezuela
and its national oil company could also sour
sentiment, as could unfavorable tariffs or trade
restrictions from the new US administration.
Finally, the backup in interest rates we expect
could raise funding costs for EM corporate issuers,
which could also heighten concerns about spillover
into EMD. Indeed, a recent stress test by Standard
& Poor’s revealed that EM corporate borrowers—
who must repay $200 billion per year through
2020 120 —are twice as susceptible to downgrades
as US corporates if dollar funding costs rise by
a third. 121
Based on the above, we do not recommend a
tactical position in EMD at this time.

2017 Global Commodity Outlook
After losing more than half its value in the span
of two years, the S&P GSCI broke its downward
trend with an 11% gain in 2016, its first doubledigit
return since 2009 (see Exhibit 92). The
rebound in oil prices was a key contributor, as oil
finished the year with a staggering 52% spot price
gain—an outcome made all the more remarkable
by the fact that oil was down 25% at its worst
point early last year. This strength was not limited
to the oil patch, as industrial metals rallied 17%
on average and precious metals advanced 8% (see
Exhibit 93).
Despite last year’s broad-based gains, we are
more circumspect about the outlook for 2017.
While we expect oil to advance, it begins the
year closer to the midpoint of our target range,
providing a more balanced risk/reward profile.
Meanwhile, we believe the key elements of
our macroeconomic forecast—Federal Reserve
tightening, rising interest rates, modest US dollar
gains and average inflation—represent continued
headwinds to gold prices. Comparable headwinds
exist for industrial metals and agricultural goods,
given the continued slowdown we expect in
Chinese growth.
We discuss the specifics of our outlook for oil
and gold in the sections that follow.

suggest the transition toward a balanced market is
underway. The same could be said for the dramatic
cuts in US drilling budgets, which have precipitated
notable declines in US shale output (see Exhibit
94). Lower oil prices have also supported aboveaverage
global demand growth, helping to absorb
excess inventories. Lastly, OPEC agreed to
lower production in November 2016, while also
securing a promise from its significant non-OPEC
counterparts to do the same. Taken together, these
developments support our forecast for moderately
higher oil prices in 2017.
This balancing act is still precarious, however.
Oil inventories stand well above seasonal averages,
so failure to honor the announced production
cuts could delay the recovery in oil prices or, even
worse, cause renewed declines. The risk of poor
compliance is not trivial, given that producers
have exceeded their quota 90% of the time by an
average of 1 million barrels per day (mmbd) since
2000 (see Exhibit 95). The pledges from Russia
and certain smaller non-OPEC producers are
particularly suspect, as similar promises to cut their

own output along with OPEC have been broken
in the past.
Moreover, while the announced cuts are
significant—the OPEC agreement would reduce
production by up to 1.2 mmbd, equivalent to
about one year of average global demand growth—
they are largely a reversal of production growth
seen over the last six months (see Exhibit 96).
Meanwhile, Libya and Nigeria were excluded from
these new OPEC quotas given sizable domestic
disruptions that have depressed their production.
Recent signs of improvement, however, suggest a
rebound in their production cannot be dismissed.
Therefore, the announced cuts are not a panacea to
the current oil imbalance, particularly if US shale
output increases meaningfully in response.
This last point is important, as US shale
accounted for 60% of global production growth
between 2012 and 2015 despite representing
less than 5% of the total output. Although US
production is now declining, two factors may
arrest its slide in 2017. First, the breakeven price
for shale drilling has fallen to an average of $50
per barrel, reflecting a 20% decline in
production costs and improvements to
the shale model, including faster drilling,
larger wells and better resource recovery.
In response, more than 200 oil rigs have
been placed in service since their number
troughed in May 2016. 122 Second, capital
spending by the US energy sector is

very depressed despite the recent uptick in rigs,
providing scope for further increases (see Exhibit
97). As a result, we expect shale production to
recover in 2017, partially offsetting cuts elsewhere.
Despite these potentially destabilizing forces,
we still think the oil market can swing to a small
deficit this year. While lower input costs create
upside risks to US shale production, these costs are
highly correlated with oil itself. As a result, today’s
$50 average breakeven level for shale is likely to
move higher with oil prices, limiting the rebound
in US production. Moreover, even if just half of
the proposed production cuts are realized, our
work suggests the oil market will still switch into a
deficit this year. Finally, OPEC spare capacity has
been largely exhausted by the production increases
of the last year, while Iran’s production has now
returned to pre-sanction levels. In turn, the risk of
another disorderly market-share battle has declined
significantly.
Against this backdrop, we expect oil supply
growth to moderate and enable oil demand to
again exceed oil production, creating the first
deficit since 2013 (see Exhibit 98). With balance
restored, we expect oil to trade in a $45–65 range
in the year ahead. Thus we continue to recommend
an overweight to US high yield energy bonds
and US MLPs.
Gold: Still Searching for Its Luster
Gold was not immune from the reversal of fortune
that befell interest rates last year, reminding us
that their fates are fundamentally linked (see
Exhibit 99). Put simply, higher interest rates raise
the opportunity cost of holding gold, since the
yellow metal generates no cash flow and must
be physically stored, often at a cost. A similarly
inverse relationship exists with the US dollar, as
investors often purchase gold as a hedge against
the debasement of fiat currencies; gold has traded
inversely to the dollar index 73% of the time on an
annual basis over the last 40 years.
Given these relationships, we believe the key
elements of our macroeconomic forecast—Federal
Reserve tightening, rising interest rates, modest US
dollar gains and average inflation—will represent
headwinds for the yellow metal in 2017. Keep in
mind that gold prices have declined in four of the
last five Federal Reserve tightening cycles, with
the only exception occurring during a period of
dollar weakness in the mid-2000s. Based on these
precedents, our expectation of two or three Federal
Reserve rate increases in 2017 does not bode well
for gold prices.

The same could be said of continued outflows
from gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We
estimate that a net 280 tonnes of gold ETF
holdings—an amount even larger than the 210
tonnes of ETF outflows that pressured gold prices
in late 2016—were purchased over the past year
at levels above today’s price. Absent a rebound
in gold prices, these ETF holders might prefer to
realize their losses and rotate into instruments with
a yield component. Value-minded investors should
also consider that gold prices remains well above
their long-term average (see Exhibit 100).
Despite this challenging outlook, a number
of factors could still buoy gold prices in the year
ahead. Emerging market central banks have
continued to buy gold to diversify their reserves.
Moreover, the stronger global growth we expect
could lift jewelry demand, particularly in gold’s
two largest end markets—China and India. Finally,
gold’s allure as an inflation hedge could come back
into focus if the market begins to worry about
economic overheating in the US, although this is
not our base case.
In light of these crosscurrents, we are tactically
neutral on gold at this time.

2017 OUTLOOK
In Closing
we do not believe the coming year will bring an end
to the prolonged run of positive performance for either the
US economy or the bull market for equities. Despite greater
uncertainties, including those tied to a new US administration,
the policy backdrop in the US will likely prove particularly
favorable for the economy, with looser fiscal policy, still easy
monetary policy and a lighter regulatory burden. As these
factors diminish the probability of recession in 2017, they
also support the case for clients remaining invested in global
equities at their strategic allocation. We believe US equity
gains are likely to be modest but still more attractive than the
comparable returns of investment alternatives such as cash
and bonds. And, as last year demonstrated, US equities often
surprise to the upside.
While we see the glass as half-full, there is no shortage of
risks—some of which have high probability and uncertain
impact for the year ahead—that could cause our forecasts for
the economy and asset class returns to miss the mark.
As always, we will adjust and communicate our views
accordingly should the economic, financial or geopolitical
backdrop change materially over the course of 2017.

Investment Risks. Risks vary by
the type of investment. For example,
investments that involve futures, equity
swaps, and other derivatives, as well
as non-investment grade securities,
give rise to substantial risk and are not
available to or suitable for all investors.
We have described some of the risks
associated with certain investments
below. Additional information regarding
risks may be available in the materials
provided in connection with specific
investments. You should not enter into
a transaction or make an investment
unless you understand the terms of
the transaction or investment and the
nature and extent of the associated
risks. You should also be satisfied that
the investment is appropriate for you in
light of your circumstances and financial
condition.
Alternative Investments. Alternative
investments may involve a substantial
degree of risk, including the risk of total
loss of an investor’s capital and the use
of leverage, and therefore may not be
appropriate for all investors. Private
equity, private real estate, hedge funds
and other alternative investments
structured as private investment
funds are subject to less regulation
than other types of pooled vehicles
and liquidity may be limited. Investors
in private investment funds should
review the Offering Memorandum,
the Subscription Agreement and any
other applicable disclosures for risks
and potential conflicts of interest.
Terms and conditions governing private
investments are contained in the
applicable offering documents, which
also include information regarding the
liquidity of such investments, which may
be limited.
Commodities. Commodity investments
may be less liquid and more volatile than
other investments. The risk of loss in
trading commodities can be substantial
due, but not limited to, volatile political,
market and economic conditions. An
investor’s returns may change radically
at any time since commodities are
subject, by nature, to abrupt changes
in price. Commodity prices are volatile
because they respond to many
unpredictable factors including weather,
labor strikes, inflation, foreign exchange
rates, etc. In an individual account,
because your position is leveraged, a
small move against your position may
result in a large loss. Losses may be
larger than your initial deposit. Investors
should carefully consider the inherent
risk of such an investment in light of
their experience, objectives, financial
resources and other circumstances. No
representation is made regarding the
suitability of commodity investments.
Currencies. Currency exchange rates
can be extremely volatile, particularly
during times of political or economic
uncertainty. There is a risk of loss when
an investor as exposure to foreign
currency or are in foreign currency
traded investments.
Emerging Markets and Growth Markets.
Investing in the securities of issuers in
emerging markets and growth markets
involves certain considerations,
including: political and economic
conditions, the potential difficulty
of repatriating funds or enforcing
contractual or other legal rights, and
the small size of the securities markets
in such countries coupled with a low
volume of trading, resulting in potential
lack of liquidity and in price volatility.
Equity Investments. Equity investments
are subject to market risk, which means
that the value of the securities may go
up or down in respect to the prospects
of individual companies, particular
industry sectors and/or general
economic conditions. The securities of
small and mid-capitalization companies
involve greater risks than those
associated with larger, more established
companies and may be subject to more
abrupt or erratic price movements.
Fixed Income. Investments in fixed
income securities are subject to the
risks associated with debt securities
generally, including credit/default,
liquidity and interest rate risk. Any
guarantee on an investment grade bond
of a given country applies only if held
to maturity.
Non-US Securities. Investing in non-US
securities involves the risk of loss
as a result of more or less non-US
government regulation, less public
information, less liquidity and greater
volatility in the countries of domicile
of the issuers of the securities and/
or the jurisdiction in which these
securities are traded. In addition,
investors in securities such as ADRs/
GDRs, whose values are influenced by
foreign currencies, effectively assume
currency risk.
Tactical Tilts. Tactical tilts may involve
a high degree of risk. No assurance can
be made that profits will be achieved
or that substantial losses will not be
incurred. Prior to investing, investors
must determine whether a particular
tactical tilt is suitable for them.
Tax Information. Goldman Sachs does
not provide legal, tax or accounting
advice. You should obtain your own
independent tax advice based on your
particular circumstances.
