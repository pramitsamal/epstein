We are offering investment units (the Units), each comprised of one Common limited partner unit 
(Common LP Unit) in KUE and one Class A ordinary share of the General Partner (Class A Share), for 
$1,000 per Unit. We are offering the Units on a strictly confidential basis pursuant to a private placement 
with Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Credit Suisse acting as placement agents (the Agents), subject to 
various conditions, exclusively to accredited investors. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale 
of the Units to expand operations, including through strategic acquisitions in the U.S. and internationally, 
to develop new products and services, to repay certain existing indebtedness and for other corporate 
purposes. We reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify the offer and to reject orders in whole or in 
part. The offering is expected to be completed in one or more closings on or prior to March 31, 2007. 
The Units and the underlying Common LP Units and Class A Shares have not been, nor will they 
be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or 
qualified under any applicable U.S. state statutes or laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction. The Units

Securities Act and Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act, and 
other similar exemptions available pursuant to the laws of the states and other jurisdictions where 
the offering will be made. 
There is no public market for the Units and no such market is expected to develop in the future. There is 
no obligation on the part of any person to register the Units or the underlying Common LP Units or Class 
A Shares under the Securities Act or any state or non-U.S. securities laws other than in the limited 
circumstances described in this Private Placement Memorandum.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR (including pro forma presentations thereof) and the 
related ratios presented in this Memorandum are supplemental measures of our performance that are not 
required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. 
(GAAP). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR are not measurements of our financial 
performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income 
or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow 
from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. 
EBITDA represents net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation (including 
impairment charges) and amortization. Pro forma presentations of EBITDA have also added back 
KinderCare Learning Centers, Inc.'s (KinderCare) discontinued operations, consistent with KLC's 
treatment of center closures and sales and KinderCare's historical presentation of EBITDA. Adjusted 
EBITDA represents EBITDA plus (i) expenses (minus gains) that we do not consider reflective of our 
ongoing operations after the KinderCare acquisition, as further described in this Memorandum and (ii) 
management fees which are subordinated to our obligations on our 7%% senior subordinated notes (the 
Notes) and which are added back in measuring our performance for purposes of our ability to incur debt 
under our indenture. Our actual and projected Adjusted EBITDA, where applicable, also exclude non-
cash stock-based compensation expense, which is also excluded under our indenture; accruals under our 
stock appreciation rights (SAR) plan; and accruals under our long term incentive plan, which are non-
cash at the time of award and vest and become payable in three years subject to continued employment 
(with certain exceptions). Our pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for 2005 excludes restructuring and integration 
charges associated with the KinderCare acquisition and the cost of operating parallel organizations during 
the integration process, which management does not consider reflective of ongoing operations. Adjusted 
EBITDAR is Adjusted EBITDA plus rent expense. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted 
EBITDAR because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and 
believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the 
evaluation of issuers, many of which present EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDAR 
when reporting their results. 
We are basing our executive incentive compensation payments in part on our performance measured 
using Adjusted EBITDA including adjustments described herein. We also use financial measures similar 
to Adjusted EBITDA, though subject to certain different adjustments, in the senior credit facility that we 
entered into in connection with the KinderCare acquisition and the indenture governing the Notes to 
measure our compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence. Measures 
similar to Adjusted EBITDA are also widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price 
potential acquisition candidates. For example, we evaluated the KinderCare acquisition and our 2003 
acquisition of ARAMARK Educational Resources to a significant degree based on their historical and 
potential EBITDA, as adjusted for items we did not consider representative of post-acquisition operations. 
We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to 
period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital 
structures (affecting relative interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies 
of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities 
and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We believe Adjusted EBITDAR is a useful 
measure of performance independent of occupancy costs. 
We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by adjusting EBITDA to eliminate the impact of a number of items we do 
not consider indicative of our ongoing operations and for the other reasons noted above. For the reasons 
indicated herein, you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and whether you consider it 
appropriate. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR, you should be aware 
that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR should 
not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring 
items. 
15 
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR have limitations as analytical tools, and you should 
not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 
Some of these limitations are: 
• they do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
• they do not reflect the cost of our non-cash stock-based compensation or our SAR plan or long term 
incentive plan or the expense associated with allocating Profits Participation LP Units (as defined 
below) to employees; 
• they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital; 
• they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service 
interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; 
• they do not reflect management fees; 
• although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and 
amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and our non-GAAP measures do not reflect cash 
requirements for such replacements or the related expense; 
• they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from the significant costs we have 
incurred in integrating KinderCare, and we are likely to incur significant integration costs in future 
acquisitions; 
• other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently 
than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure; and 
• they do not comply with the requirements of Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or Regulation G of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR should not be 
considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or 
reduce our indebtedness. We compensate for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results as well as 
these non-GAAP measures. 
For more information, see our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements 
included elsewhere in this Memorandum.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this 
Memorandum. You should carefully consider the information set forth under Risk Factors. The term KUE refers 
only to Knowledge Universe Education L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The terms Knowledge 
Universe Education, the Company, we, us and our refer to KUE and, where applicable, its subsidiaries, and 
do not refer to the Agents. In November 2005, KLC separated its education operations (KLC OpCo') from its real 
estate assets (KLC PropCo'). 
1.1. Company Overview 
KUE is the third largest for-profit education company in the world and the largest for-profit education 
company in the pre-school to 12th grade segment (pre-K-12) in the world. While the Company's 
operations are currently based within the U.S., the proceeds from this transaction will be used primarily to 
expand KUE's education platform both globally and across the pre-K-12 education continuum. KUE's 
existing portfolio of assets consists of: 
(i) 
KLC OpCo, the leading early childhood education 
(ECE) company with 2,507 locations in 39 states 
and the District of Columbia and nearly two and a 
half times larger than its next closest competitor in 
terms of revenue; 
(ii) KLC PropCo, one of the largest education based 
real estate portfolios in the U.S. consisting of 845 
early childhood centers located in 37 states; and 
Knowledge Universe 
Education LP 
87.6%1 
KUE Management Inc. 
(General Partner) 
17.9% to 40.0%2 
Knowledge Learning 
Corporation (KLC) 
k12 Inc. 
(iii) A significant interest in k12, an online curriculum 
provider and kindergarten through 12th grade management company, currently serving over 
25,000 students as the largest operator of online virtual schools in the U.S. 
The principal owners of KUE are Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and Steven Green (collectively the 
Principals). Michael Milken and Lowell Milken each has more than two decades of experience in the 
education sector through involvement in several for-profit and not-for-profit initiatives. Steven Green, 
former U.S. ambassador to Singapore, has more than two decades of experience as an international 
industrialist leading major corporate restructurings and expansions in manufacturing, housing, consumer 
products, retail and real estate enterprises. The Company represents the Principals' sole vehicle for 
equity investment opportunities in the pre-K-12 sector going forward. 
The Principals founded the Company and its affiliated companies over the past decade based on their 
vision of a world where competition for human capital3 is becoming the driving force of economic 
prosperity. To remain competitive in the world economy, countries will be forced to invest heavily in the 
development of their human capital. The Principals believe that an investment made in an individual's 
education, especially at a young age, is the most effective way to build human capital and thereby 
increase that individual's lifelong productivity. As the largest for-profit provider of ECE in the world, the 
Company is well positioned to capitalize on these trends. 
:The 12.4% minority position is held by various investors. 
KUE's ownership varies depending on the liquidation value or sale value of k12 and according to the preference of the various securities KUE owns. 
At higher valuations, KUE's percentage ownership is lower. See k12 Inc. (k12) — k12 Equity.

August 2002.

Education is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross 
national income of $48 trillion.4 In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1 trillion market.' Education 
is still predominantly provided by public / governmental entities in most countries including the U.S. KUE 
believes that the industry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the 
evolution observed in the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and 
telecommunications. 
The Company's strategy is to grow its existing platforms both domestically and internationally and to 
expand its assets globally across the pre-K-12 education continuum. In addition to its current investments 
in ECE and online curriculum, KUE will seek to expand by acquiring education companies offering 
services or products that can complement its current offering. KUE believes that owning a diversified 
portfolio of assets in the pre-K-12 education space will allow it to leverage content and best practices 
across multiple constituencies and to multiple markets. KUE's strategy in U.S. ECE is to expand its 
existing platform through the opening of new centers, opportunistic acquisitions of smaller competitors 
and the sale of education-related products and services through existing channels. Internationally, KUE 
has identified several near-term opportunities to expand into Europe, the Middle-East and Asia, with some 
of these opportunities in advanced stages of preparation. 
Management has a history of successfully growing through acquisitions. In May 2003, KLC acquired 
Aramark Educational Resources (AER), a company three times its size in terms of revenue. 
Management completed the integration of AER in approximately 12 months, realizing approximately $10 
million in net annual synergies and improving operational performance. In January 2005, the Company 
acquired KinderCare, the largest provider of ECE services in the U.S. at the time. Management achieved 
approximately $25 million in net annualized synergies through the closing of under-performing centers 
and the rationalization of corporate overhead. In November 2005, KLC separated its education 
operations (KLC OpCo) from its real estate assets (KLC PropCo). Management believes this division 
allows KLC OpCo management to focus on the core business of operating and growing the ECE 
business while the maximization of the valuable educational real estate portfolio is managed and 
expanded by a professional real estate firm, Greenstreet Real Estate Partners (formerly Greenstreet 
Realty Partners, L.P.), and also represents management's view of KLC's component businesses. 
Management believes that KUE presents an attractive financial profile with its combination of businesses: 
(i) KLC OpCo, which generated $1.48 billion in pro forma revenue and $150 million in pro forma Adjusted 
EBITDA6 in 2005, is projected to grow organically to $2.3 billion and $320 million by 2011, respectively 
and to generate operating cash flow growing from $72 million in 2005 to $214 million in 2011; (ii) a real 
estate portfolio in KLC PropCo that generated an additional $88 million in pro forma EBITDA in 2005; and 
(Hi) an investment in k12, which continues to deliver top line growth in excess of 25% and has seen its 
revenue grow at a 133% compounded annual growth rate over the last three fiscal years (from $6.7 
million in 2002 to $85.1 million in 2005).

Education is one of the largest sectors in the world and represents a large portion of a country's 
investments 
— Represents approximately 5% of global gross national income of $48 trillion. In the U.S. alone, 
education represents a $1 trillion market with for-profit education accounting for approximately $81 
billion or 7.8% of the overall market. 
— The pre-K-12 segment of the education market is approximately a $610 billion market, with for-
profit pre-K-12 education accounting for approximately $37.4 billion, over 6.1% of the pre-K-12 
market/ 
The for-profit education sector is growing at an attractive rate 
— U.S. education spending has grown at a stable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% 
since 1993. The for-profit component of this industry (pre-K-12, post secondary and corporate 
training) is projected to grow faster than the overall historical industry growth rate, at a 7.4% annual 
rate, reflecting the increasing importance of for-profit operations in the sector, to reach a market 
size of $116 billion by 2010.7 
— In addition, these estimates do not reflect the growing segment of direct to consumer educational 
materials such as supplemental tutoring, which represented an estimated $20 billion of additional 
spending in 2004. 
• Increasing competition for human capital 
To remain competitive in the global economy, countries are investing heavily in the development of their 
human capital, especially at young ages 
— According to the World Bank's World Education Indicators, worldwide enrollment rates in pre-
primary education increased by 37% from 1995 to 2003.8 
— KUE believes that education companies will become significantly more valuable as countries 
become increasingly aware of the competitive advantages afforded by education. Of the top 100 
global companies by market cap, not a single education company is represented on the list. 
As globalization of the economy and improving technologies flatten the playing field, demand for more 
standardized education across regions increases  
— KUE believes that increasingly global education standards, enhanced workforce mobility and new 
technologies are catalysts of world competition for human capital. 
• Several international growth opportunities 
The Company is starting to execute on its international development strategy 
— In the near term, the Company is focusing on opportunities identified in the United Kingdom, Saudi 
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China. Depending on the state and organization of each 
country's education sector, KUE's development will be executed through cooperation with 
government authorities, outright acquisitions and/or the establishment of partnerships with key local 
players.

21 
— These initiatives could provide three key regional platforms for further development and 
consolidation. 
In the medium term, numerous opportunities for KUE should be generated by the increasing demand for 
quality for-profit educational offerings by governments and citizens around the world  
— Competitive pressures for development of human capital, deficiencies of national education 
systems, growth of a middle-class in China, India and the Middle East, demand for English 
language offerings and changing demographics are some of the primary drivers of increased 
demand internationally. 
— In China alone, 274 million children are under the age of 15, and 100 million are single-children 
under the age of 25, as a result of the one-child policy. These demographics result in large 
demand for education and increased spending capacity per child. 
I• Favorable demographic trends and customer behavior in the U.S. 
Growing number of working mothers 
— According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates, women are expected to represent 
nearly 48% of the total U.S. workforce by 2012, up from 46.6% in 2002.° 
— In the U.S., approximately 60% of mothers with children under the age of six are employed. 
Increasing birth rate  
— There are approximately 24 million children under the age of five in the U.S. today. According to 
the U.S. Census Bureau, absolute birth rates are going to continue to increase, and the population 
of children in the U.S. five and under is expected to increase to approximately 27 million by 2015.10 
Essential nature of the service to the consumer 
— As with healthcare, parents are primarily focused on the quality of the service that their child 
receives and the proximity of the center to their home or work; price is typically a secondary 
consideration. By relieving parents of the requirement to stay at home with their children, ECE 
allows both men and women to participate in the workforce and generate income for the 
household. 
1.2.2 Compelling Business Profile 
• KUE presents an attractive financial profile 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo had operations in 39 states and Washington 
D.C. and generated pro forma revenue of $1.48 billion  
— With organic growth projected to be in excess of 5% per annum through 2011, geographic diversity 
and double-digit Adjusted EBITDA margins, KLC OpCo can generate attractive returns. 
— KLC OpCo generates strong operating cash flow (48% of 2005 pro forma Adjusted EBITDA) which 
provides significant resources to fund investment and support equity return-enhancing leverage, a

capability that is expected to increase in line with the 13.5% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR projected 
until 2011. 
k12 continues to grow at an impressive rate, with annual enrollment growth proiected in excess of 25% 
over the next two years 
— Many of k12's direct costs are semi-fixed in nature (e.g., school administration) creating strong 
economies of scale as this business continues to grow. 
— With $70 million invested in the development of the platform for kindergarten to 9th grade classes, 
extension of the offering into new states and schools is expected to be achieved at relatively low 
costs.

— The programs are marketed primarily under the KinderCare, Children's Discovery Centers, 
Knowledge Beginnings, and Children's World brand names. KinderCare enjoyed 87% aided 
awareness as of November 2005.11 
• Superior competitive position of KLC OpCo as a result of proprietary curriculum, standards of 
excellence and experience and scale 
11 Source: Parthenon Conjoint Survey. 
23 
KLC OpCo has leveraged its scale and operational expertise to roll out a proprietary curriculum and to 
provide enhanced corporate level services 
— Curriculum has been developed, rolled out and refined over many years and provides a significant competitive advantage in an industry where small independent players do not have the resources to develop comparable programs. — Operational leverage allows for enhanced marketing, back-office, legal and compliance functions, keeping KLC OpCo at the forefront of education standards. Controls that meet or exceed requirements established by licensing authorities, state and federal 
government and accrediting bodies 
— Controls include rigorous and stringent hiring procedures and uniform rules for conduct. — 43% of KLC OpCo's centers, over four times the industry average of 10%, are accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (referred to herein as NAEYC), the nation's leading accreditation body. Management believes that all the Company's centers' operations and policies meet or are substantially compliant with NAEYC accreditation requirements. • A compelling business model at k12 As the state of education across the U.S. is generating increasing concerns, k12 provides a compelling 
value proposition 
— Children continue to perform poorly on assessment tests geared to measure reading, writing and math skills. The passing of legislation such as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 which, among other things, provides for increased funding for education and implementation of achievement level standards, demonstrates the commitment of government to address the issue. Technology and content platform easily leverageable to provide results-driven curriculum and service 
— With $70 million invested in the development of the platform for kindergarten to 9th grade classes, extension of the offering into new states and schools is expected to be achieved at relatively low costs. — k12 benefits from stable demand for its curriculum and services which is reflected by current reenrollment rates of 65% to 70%. — Many of the direct costs are semi-fixed in nature (e.g., school administration) creating strong economies of scale as this business continues to grow. • Valuable real estate portfolio of centers providing solid asset base 845 owned centers recently appraised at approximately $1.25 billion12 
— New organization separating management of real estate assets allows KLC OpCo education teams to focus on the core education business. — Long term partnership with Greenstreet Real Estate Partners ensuring state-of-the-art management of the real estate assets by a leader in this field. 
12 Actual appraisal was for 713 out of 845 centers and the appraised value was $1.1 billion. The $1.25 billion is achieved by taking the independent appraisal valuation methodology and extrapolating it to the remaining 132 centers.

B Strong leadership teams 
KUE 
___ Strong team of highly experienced professionals at the KUE level, led by CEO Lowell Milken, 
Chairman Michael Milken and Vice-Chairmen Steven Green and Ted Sanders. The team 
contributes an average of more than two decades of experience in their respective fields to KUE. 
___ Providing corporate headquarters support services in the areas of strategy and business 
development, acquisitions, recruiting of executives, communication and government relations. 
KLC OpCo 
— Highly experienced management team comprised of both experts in the field of education (C00 Dr. 
Elanna Yalow has substantial experience operating for-profit ECE centers), as well as business 
professionals. 
— Seasoned executive and middle management team with average Company tenure of ten years. 
k12 
— Chairman, Founder and acting CEO Ron Packard has extensive experience in the K-12 education 
space and was previously with KLC before founding k12. John Baule, Executive Vice President 
and CFO, served as CFO of Headstrong for five years before joining k12. 
1.2.3 Value Creating Strategy 
• Value is created by owning assets across the pre-K-12 education continuum 
Incremental value is expected to be created from strategic and financial synergies inherent in a global 
platform  
— The Company can exploit the similarities in various education markets by capitalizing on the assets 
it owns (e.g., using KLC's expertise to establish similar operations across geographies and across 
the pre-K-12 education continuum). 
— Sharing of best practices globally and ability to cross-sell products and services to the Company's 
customers. 
— Entry into less structured international markets early in their development cycle to establish 
attractive competitive positions. 
• Multiple growth opportunities at KLC and k12 
Top line organic growth at KLC OpCo is expected to be driven by several factors:  
___ Historically the industry has demonstrated a pattern of price increases above inflation. Historical 
industry data shows an average tuition rate increase of 7% per annum.13 
— Higher Utilization14 resulting from increased student enrollment, improved retention rates, further 
network rationalization to better align supply with demand, more favorable center build rate in the 
broader industry and favorable macro trends. 
Source: The National Economic Impacts of the Child Care Sector 2002. 
25 
— The ECE industry generates approximately $54 billion in total spending in the U.S. and has grown 
at a compound annual growth rate of 10% since 1982. It is expected to grow at a 3.4% 
compounded annual rate through 2010 according to Harris Nesbitt research. The ECE industry's 
growth has been driven by several favorable social and demographic trends including: the increase 
in working mothers and single-parent or dual-income families, historically high birth rates, and 
increase in popularity of center-based care. 
___ Net opening of new centers as the integration of KinderCare winds down and the number of center 
openings starts exceeding the number of closures. 
— Leverage of KLC OpCo's footprint to market additional educational products and services to the 
more than 300,000 children KLC OpCo interacts with each year, their parents, grandparents and 
other child care providers. Selected incremental revenue opportunities include: foreign language or 
music lessons, educational materials and financial services (life insurance, health insurance, tuition 
financing, etc.). 
Growth through acquisitions and industry consolidation  
— Consolidation strategy supported by the highly fragmented early childhood industry, with for-profit 
chains representing only approximately 5% of the market in aggregate, and small independent 
providers representing 60% of the market.15 
___ Management has demonstrated an ability to grow through acquisitions, as evidenced by the three 
networks acquired by KLC since inception, of sizes up to 1,000 centers. 
Multiple drivers of expected double-digit growth at k12 
— Existing school enrollment rates at k12 expected to continue to increase at double digit rates for at 
least the next three years, as k12 further penetrates its existing markets through commercial and 
marketing push. 
— k12 currently operates virtual public schools in 11 states and the District of Columbia. As 
legislatures in other states permit the formation of virtual public schools, k12 expects to have 
opportunities to expand into new states. 
Utilization is calculated as the total actual child care revenues earned at centers that are open at the calculation date divided by the total potential 
child care revenue (based upon the center's undiscounted pre-school tuition rate and the center's total licensed capacity) during the related time 
period.

Distributions. 
Assuming that 1,000,000 Units are sold to Investors by 
March 31, 2007, and that the accrued dividends on the 
preferred limited partner units are paid in cash, KUE LLC, 
controlled by the Principals, will hold approximately 
1,530,000 Common LP Units representing approximately 
60% ownership in KUE (excluding Profits Participation LP 
Units) and 1,530,000 Class A Shares. The Common LP 
Units owned by KUE LLC will not be transferable, except to 
(i) the Principals; (ii) to affiliates of the Principals; and/or OD 
to family members and/or charitable organizations in 
connection with the Principals' estate planning, unless 
combined with the corresponding percentage of Class A 
Shares to form Units and transferred in the form of Units in 
accordance with the Limited Partnership Agreement. 
Knowledge Universe Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited 
liability company (KUH LLC) controlled by the Principals, 
will hold 900 Class B ordinary shares of the General Partner 
(the Class B Shares). The Class B Shares held by the 
Principals and their affiliates will not be transferable, except 
to (i) the Principals; (H) to the affiliates of the Principals; 
and/or (iii) to family members and/or charitable organizations 
in connection with the Principals' estate planning. The Class 
B Shares will automatically convert to Class A Shares if the 
Principals' aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in 
KUE is less than 15% of the outstanding Partnership Units 
(as defined below) of KUE. 
A limited liability company (KULG LLC-1), of which 
Knowledge Universe Learning Group LLC, a Delaware 
limited liability company that is controlled by the Principals 
(KULG), and certain other persons designated by KULG 
are members, will be the holder of the Profits Participation 
LP Units (the Profits Participation Limited Partner) with the 
economic rights as set forth in — Distributions below. At 
each closing of any sale of Units to Investors where the 
aggregate purchase price of all Units acquired by Investors 
to date is less than or equal to $1.5 billion (during the 
Offering Period or thereafter), the Profits Participation 
Limited Partner will be issued a number of Profits 
Participation LP Units such that the aggregate shall equal at 
least 9/11ths of the 11% of Partnership Units (Common LP 
Units, GP Units, and Profits Participation LP Units) that may 
be represented by Profits Participation LP Units. Additional 
Profits Participation LP Units will be issued to the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner, at such time and in such 
numbers as the Profits Participation Limited Partner will 
direct, based upon the issuance by the Profit Participation 
Limited Partner of interests to members of the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner (who may include employees, 
officers, directors, consultants and agents of KUE, its 
29 
subsidiaries and joint ventures as designated by KULG other 
than the Principals and their affiliates), the vesting schedule 
of such interests, and whether certain tax elections are made 
by the recipients of such interests; provided, however, the 
total number of Profits Participation LP Units shall not 
exceed a number equal to eleven percent (11%) of the 
aggregate number of Partnership Units. Any increase in the 
number of Profits Participation LP Units following the sale of 
the first $1.5 billion of Common LP Units to Investors 
requires a majority vote of the Independent Committee. 
Subsequent to the completion of this offering, KUE may 
raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt 
securities. KUE will not have any preferred limited partner 
units outstanding upon completion of this offering but KUE 
may issue limited partner units with preferences over the 
Common LP Units in the future and may amend the Limited 
Partnership Agreement accordingly. 
Distributions: 
First, to the Common Limited Partners and the General 
Partner in proportion to and to the extent of their unreturned 
Capital Contributions, but in no case may a distribution 
pursuant to this paragraph exceed a Partner's positive 
adjusted capital account balance; 
Second, to the Common Limited Partners and the General 
Partner and the Profits Participation Limited Partner (with 
respect to Profits Participation Units theretofore allocated to 
persons other than the Principals and their Affiliates, if 
specified by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, but not 
with respect to more than 2/11ths of the Profits Participation 
Units) to the extent of an 8% preferred return; 
Third, to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in the 
additional amount the Profits Participation Limited Partner 
would have received pursuant to the prior paragraph if it had 
fully participated in the distribution of the 8% preferred return 
with respect to all outstanding Profits Participation Units; and 
Fourth, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner, and the General Partner in 
proportion to the number of Units held by each such Partner. 
Distributions may be made in cash or in kind. Allocations of 
income, gains, profits and losses are described in The 
Structure of KUE and the General Partner in this Private 
Placement Memorandum. 
The Limited Partnership Agreement gives the General 
Partner the authority to override the distribution provisions of 
the Limited Partnership Agreement described above in order 
to achieve the desired economic arrangement of KUE, which 
is: (i) first, to return the Partners' Capital Contributions to 
them; (ii) second, for the Common Limited Partners and the 
General Partner to receive their Preferred Return while the 
30 
Profits Participation Limited Partner concurrently receives an 
amount equal to a fraction of the amount the Common 
Limited Partners and the General Partner received pursuant 
to their Preferred Return (such fraction to be equal to the
