high school. Only one-third of the 25% of Americans who have received a bachelor's degree, or 8%, 
have received a graduate degree.16 
Studies by Nobel Prize winning economist James Heckman suggest that the highest rate of return within 
education is generated through an investment in early childhood programs. Heckman's study asserts, 
The rate of return to a dollar investment made while a person is young is higher than the rate of return to 
the same dollar made at a later age, as illustrated below:

Due to the high rate of return of investments in ECE and the principles underlying the theory of human 
capital, KUE has made its largest initial investment in KLC, the largest company serving the ECE market 
in the world.

8.2. The Education Market 
Education is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross 
national income of $48 trillion.17 In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1.0 trillion market with for-
profit education accounting for $81 billion or 7.8% of this amount.18 The for-profit component of this 
industry (pre-K-12, post secondary and corporate training) is projected to grow faster than the overall 
historical industry growth rate, at a 7.4% annual rate, reflecting the increasing importance of for-profit 
operations in the sector, to reach a market size of $116 billion by 2010.19 Education is still predominantly 
provided by public / governmental entities in most countries including the U.S. KUE believes that the 
industry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the evolution observed 
in the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and telecommunications.

8.3. The U.S. Early Childcare or pre-K Market 
The highly fragmented early childcare or pre-K market includes care based in homes and housed by 
community organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, YMCAs) and center based facilities. Center-
based childcare includes preschools (nurseries), workplace centers (located on-site at the company), 
lease-model centers (located in a real estate developer's office building), back-up centers (a variety of on-
site and off-site back-up care programs) and family day-care facilities (located in someone's home or 
center). Although childcare may evoke thoughts of a babysitting service, education has become an 
increasingly important element in services to pre-K children. However, the education-focused portion of 
the childcare market remains relatively small. 
Since the early 1980s, center-based ECE has become the care provider of choice for families. The U.S. 
ECE unit generated an estimated $54 billion in total spending in 2005, representing a 10% compound 
annual growth rate since 1982.19 Approximately five million or 60% of 3 to 5-year-olds with working 
mothers are enrolled in ECE centers. 9 The following growth drivers are expected to continue to fuel 
growth in the early childcare market: growing importance of ECE, demographics (e.g., more children aged 
five and younger), increase in families with two working parents, more educated parents, corporations 
recognizing the benefits of childcare services and tax incentives and other positive legislation. 
The perception of ECE as a fundamental component of child development has contributed to average 
annual fee increases of roughly 7% amongst center-based facilities, reflecting the stable, relatively 
inelastic nature of the demand for higher quality care.21 The number of children receiving childcare

outside the home grew from 10.6 million in 1999 to an estimated 12 million in 2003, an increase of 3.1% 
annually.22 
8.3.1 Early Childhood Education's Role in the Economy 
ECE enables people to pursue income-generating activities by allowing parents to participate in the 
workforce and contribute to the economy. A recent study found that every dollar spent on the formal ECE 
sector generates approximately 15 dollars worth of additional earnings by parents. 23 Furthermore, 
evidence suggests that regardless of family income, children who have participated in ECE programs do 
better in school than their peers who did not. ECE also reduces social and economic costs by lowering 
school dropout rates, and leads to decreased levels of criminal activity. These social and demographic 
forces have established ECE as a fundamental component of today's economic 'infrastructure' and a 
source of economic growth. 
Given these and other supporting facts, education is an industry that is of growing importance to the 
economy. This growth is driven by the following factors: 
M Growing public awareness of the importance of early childhood education. ECE has received 
increased media and government attention as scientific research highlights the importance of 
education during a child's early developmental years. Children who attend high quality ECE centers 
demonstrate greater mathematical ability, thinking and attention skills, and fewer behavioral problems 
throughout their educational lives, when compared with children receiving no or lower quality care. 
These differences hold true for children from a range of family backgrounds.24 
• Favorable demographic trends. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the annual 
number of live births in the U.S. was approximately 4.1 million in 2003, compared to approximately 3.6 
million in 1980, and the U.S. Census Bureau projects the annual number of live births to increase to 
approximately 4.5 million in 2015.25 The number of children aged five years or under grew from 
approximately 22.5 million in 1990 to approximately 23.4 million in 2002, according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau, and is projected to reach 26.8 million in 2015.22

• Changing workforce composition. A rising percentage of women participate in the workforce due to an 
increasingly higher cost of living, a desire for financial independence and an elevated standard of 
living preference, which necessitates two full-time wage earners for most families. Of the nearly 65 
million jobs created nationally between 1964 and 1997, 40 million were occupied by women. Today, 
more than 62% of mothers with children under the age of six work full-time compared to 19% in 1960.

64 
• Highly educated parents spend more on childcare. The increasing number of college graduates in the 
U.S. and abroad will support continued expenditures on ECE. In 2001, 70% of children with college-
educated mothers attended childcare programs, while only 38% of children whose mothers had less 
than a high school degree attended childcare programs. A recent report by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce reveals that families with college degrees spent an average of $92.67 per week (per child) 
on childcare in 2000, whereas parents without a high school degree only spent an average of $59.70 
per week per child.26 
• Increasing demand for Employer-Sponsored Centers. With increased levels of employment, 
corporations are witnessing growing demand for ECE services. Companies benefit from offering 
childcare services to their employees as (i) it often reduces employee absenteeism; (ii) serves as a 
perquisite, which differentiates the employer's compensation package; and (iii) tends to lower turnover 
rates. ECE services contribute to a stable and consistent workforce. 
• Favorable tax incentives. Certain tax incentives are available to parents utilizing childcare programs. 
Specifically, Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a federal income tax credit (Child and 
Dependent Care Credit) ranging from 20% to 35% (increased in 2003) of certain childcare expenses 
for qualifying individuals. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 created a 
Federal Employer Tax Credit for certain childcare expenses beginning in 2002. Employers can 
receive a credit of 25% of their spending on the construction or rehabilitation of a child care facility or 
on contracts with a third party child care facility to provide child care services to employees. 
Corporations also benefit from tax incentives of up to $150,000 per year. 
8.3.2 Industry Characteristics 
The ECE sector has a number of favorable operating characteristics. First, well-run school operators 
enjoy high returns on capital, predictable revenue streams and strong free cash flows, with students 
generally paying in advance of services delivered. Second, industry data shows that tuition rates have 
increased by approximately 7%, a rate which has exceeded inflation.27 The current outlook suggests no 
change in this dynamic. Third, government regulation and licensing standards represent notable barriers 
to entry. 
Given that education is a universally accepted product, management believes that our business model is 
highly scalable. The basic center model is expected to be essentially repeatable and transferable to new 
markets and locations. With labor representing approximately 50% of the total operating cost structure, 
companies within this sector tend to benefit from a variable cost structure, which allows them to reduce 
costs as economic and market conditions change. 
Often the demanding requirements for the selection of school directors and teachers can limit the pool of 
qualified employees for the industry. Low pay also tends to result in high turnover rates of approximately 
50% annually within the industry. 
8.3.3 Competitive Landscape: Early Childhood Education 
The ECE sector is highly fragmented with the top six providers representing approximately 5% of all 
organized ECE centers. The Company's primary competitors are (i) local nursery schools and child care 
centers, some of which are non-profit (including religious-affiliated centers), (H) providers of services that 
operate out of their homes and (Hi) other for-profit companies which may operate a number of centers. 
Local nursery schools and ECE centers generally charge less for their services. Many religious-affiliated 
and other non-profit child care centers have no or lower rental costs than for-profit chains, may receive 
donations or other funding to cover operating expenses and may utilize volunteers for staffing. 
Consequently, tuition rates at these centers are commonly lower than the Company's rates.

KLC OpCo successfully competes against these companies, with the following differentiating factors: (i) 
strong brand equity; (ii) a strong management team; (iii) grass roots level marketing; and (iv) a larger 
network of community centers. KLC also has a number of employer-sponsored centers that gives the 
Company greater breadth and depth. Finally, KLC is the only large competitor in the sector owned by an 
education company. Following is a brief description of each of several of the national competitors. 
I ABC Learning (Public, traded on the ASX) 
The Learning Care Group, ABC Learning's U.S. operating segment, has over 30,000 children enrolled 
(full and part-time) nationwide. Under the Childtime and Tutor Time segments, Learning Care operates 
child care centers and under the Franchise segment it licenses and provides developmental and 
administrative support to franchises operating under the Tutor Time brand. As of October 14, 2005, 
Childtime generated LTM sales of $220.7 million across 460 childcare centers in the U.S. (328 of which 
are company owned and 132 of which are franchised locations). On January 11, ABC announced it had 
successfully completed the acquisition of the Learning Care Group, Inc. for $159 million in cash. In 
addition to the 460 centers located in the U.S., ABC operates 707 centers in Australia and New Zealand. 
• Bright Horizons (Public) 
Founded in 1986, Bright Horizons Family Solutions is a leading provider of employer-sponsored child 
care services. Bright Horizons operates 616 childcare and early education centers for over 600 clients. 
The company serves more than 66,300 children in 39 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, Guam, 
Ireland and the United Kingdom. In September of 2005, the company acquired ChildrensFirst Inc. As of 
December 31, 2005, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $625 million and $75 million, 
respectively. 
• La Petite Academy (Private) 
La Petite is the third largest operator of for-profit pre-school centers in the U.S., currently serving more 
than 65,000 children in 649 centers located in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The company also 
66 
owns 68 (included in the 649 centers) Montessori schools which cater to K-12 students. LPA's residential 
Academies are typically located in residential, middle-income neighborhoods. As of February 28, 2006, 
the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $411 million and $33 million, respectively. The 
company has been owned by JP Morgan Capital since 1998. 
Nobel Learning Communities (Public) 
Nobel is a for-profit provider of private pay education and services for education entities for the preschool 
through 12th grade market. The company's programs are offered through a network of general education 
preschools, elementary and middle schools, programs for learning challenged students and special 
purpose high schools. Nobel operates 150 schools in 13 states across the U.S. As of December 31, 
2005, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $166 million and $15 million, respectively. 
Affiliates of the Principals are currently significant shareholders of the company. 
8.3.4 Government's Role in Early Childhood Education 
Approximately 83% of the estimated $54 billion spent on ECE is generated by private and independent 
non-profit services. The government provides the remaining 17% of services through Head Start and 
public schools. The government pays for public school and Head Start programs, but also subsidizes 
payments of low-income families to providers of their choice through the Child Care Development Block 
Grant and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which are blended with state dollars. About 25% of 
for-profit early childhood care revenue comes from these subsidy programs. 
The government is, at both the federal and state level, actively involved in expanding the availability of 
early childhood care services. Federal support is delivered at the state level through government-
operated educational and financial assistance programs. Early childhood care services offered directly by 
states include training, licensing and regulation for early childhood care providers and resource and 
referral systems for parents seeking ECE. 
The increasing importance of education is further demonstrated by the No Child Left Behind Act of 
2001, signed into law in January 2002. This Act is the most sweeping reform of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act, or ESEA, since ESEA was enacted in 1965. To support this commitment, 
President Bush requested a $54.4 billion budget for the Department of Education for fiscal 2007, a 28.9% 
increase from the 2001 budget of $42.2 billion. 
Certain tax incentives exist for early childhood care programs. Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code 
provides federal income tax credits ranging from 20% to 35% of certain early childhood care expenses for 
qualified individuals. 
8.4. The U.S. K-12 Education Market 
A fundamental change has occurred in the K-12 sector in recent years, as the desire to improve school 
quality has overtaken demographics as a key growth driver. Companies providing supplemental 
educational services (e.g., KLC) and several school alternatives, such as charter and contract schools 
(e.g., k12), are expected to be instrumental in improving K-12 student performance. 
The K-12 education market in the U.S. is comprised of over 15,000 school districts including more than 
90,000 K-12 public schools, approximately 3.5 million teachers, and about 54 million students according 
to the National Center for Education Statistics. Total K-12 expenditures, federal, state and local, are 
approximately $500 billion. 
Despite the growth in spending on public education over the last decade, student achievement has shown 
little progress. According to the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 32% of eighth-
graders performed below the Basic level in mathematics, and only 29% performed at or above the 
Proficient level. One-third of American fourth graders are functionally illiterate. KUE believes the 
following factors will present significant market opportunities in the coming years for for-profit K-12 
67 
education providers. According to Harris Nesbitt Research, industry experts estimate that the $21.8 
billion in revenues generated by for-profit education providers in 2004 will increase to over $29.7 billion in 
2010, 5.3% annual growth. 2° However, these estimates reflect only spending by institutions on 
educational material and do not reflect the growing segment of direct to consumer educational materials, 
which represented roughly an additional $20 billion in 2004.28

report (December 2004). 
Standards and Accountability. Due to the unsatisfactory performance of American students in grades K-
12, parents and lawmakers are demanding increased standards and accountability in schools. This 
demand has focused on establishing guidelines for every school and every subgroup of students and 
then holding the school (and its staff) accountable to students' performance relative to those standards. 
The Company expects continued focus on academic standards, assessments, and accountability in the 
near future. Despite this increased attention on standards and accountability, many parents continue to 
remain concerned with the overall effectiveness of the public school system and are increasingly relying 
on for-profit education providers. 
Charter Schools and Virtual Academies. There has also been a significant rise in the number of charter 
schools in the U.S. in the past decade. Since Minnesota first enacted legislation in 1991, 40 states and 
the District of Columbia have passed charter school legislation. Under the typical charter school statute, 
an identified entity, such as the state, a state university or local school district board of education, is 
authorized to grant a specified number of charters to community groups or non-profit entities to create a 
public charter school. A growing number of charter boards, in turn, contract with private sector 
organizations to manage the schools. In return for a large measure of autonomy from normal public 
school regulation, the charter school is accountable for student academic performance. Currently, the 
Company estimates that there were nearly 2,700 charter schools in operation nationwide, as of January 
2003, with an estimated enrollment of over 685,000 students. Moreover, the federal No Child Left Behind 
Act (NCLB) recognizes charter schools as a viable alternative for students who want to transfer from 
neighborhood schools that are failing. 
To capitalize upon the increasing number of parents who are willing to educate their children at home and 
still want to be part of the public system, there are a growing number of virtual schools, where much of 
the learning is home-based. Most current charter school legislation either explicitly authorizes virtual 
public schools or does not directly prohibit them. Because virtual schools usually offer a comprehensive 
curriculum, easy-to-use learning and performance evaluation technology assistance and instructional 
materials, the Company believes that a growing number of families will pursue virtual public schools as an 
attractive alternative to traditional schools and a more cost-effective, better organized approach to home 
schooling. The large and scalable platform that exists at k12 is designed to capitalize on this trend as the 
number of charter schools has grown on average nearly 13% annually, while charter school enrollment

Supplementary Education Market. For parents who continue to enroll their children in traditional public 
and private schools, there is a growing demand for supplemental education services. According to the 
U.S. Department of Education, 31% of elementary school children, or more than 10 million students 
nationwide, are enrolled in after-school programs. According to Eduventures, the U.S. supplementary 
education market was estimated to be approximately $8.1 billion in 2003. Additionally, under the No 
Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, some children in poorly performing schools will be eligible for taxpayer-
financed supplemental educational services. These supplemental educational services can be provided 
by state-approved non-profit or for-profit entities as well as private schools and public schools (including 
public charter schools). More parents want to spend educational time with their children, but lack access 
to high quality supplemental material that is effective and integrated into a comprehensive plan that is 
easy for a parent to deliver and manage. 
The virtual school market is a relatively new area within the broader K-12 education market. As a result, 
there is a growing need for a high quality, trusted, national education offering for this demographic. 
Furthermore, parents are seeking much more robust and comprehensive ongoing assessments than is 
currently offered in the public schools, in order to assess their children's progress both on a relative and 
an absolute basis. 
8.5. The International Education Industry 
The leading authority on the worldwide education industry, the United Nations Educational Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO), estimates that average public expenditures on education across the 
world increased from 4.1% of GNP in 1990 to 4.5% in 2000. In developing countries the increased 
government focus on education is more pronounced as public education expenditures rose to 4.1% in 
2000 from 3.5% in 1990. Based on global gross national income of $48 trillion, KUE estimates that the 
global education market opportunity is greater than $2.4 trillion driven by the following factors: 
• Large population of school-aqed children in parts of the world. The opportunity for pre-K-12 education 
is particularly strong in certain countries with high fertility rates. Examples of such opportunities 
include India, where mothers give birth to an average of 2.78 children. Increases in the population of 
children coupled with an increased awareness of the economic and social benefits of education are 
expected to lead to significant growth in the global ECE market. 
29 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005 and Charter School Leadership Council and Center for Education Reform. 
69 
• Increased government focus on education. In many countries, per student public spending on 
education represents a larger portion of per capita GDP than in the U.S. For example, in Australia and 
the United Kingdom, the government has subsidized a large portion of ECE. Now, countries such as 
Saudi Arabia are developing similar programs. The opportunity for increased government spending on 
pre-K-12 education is particularly apparent in growing economies such as China and South Korea as 
those countries increase their share of world GDP. 
• Potential opportunities in countries with declining populations. In countries that have had low fertility 
rates for several generations, such as Japan and Italy, there often exists a large family structure 
supporting a single child. KUE believes that this leads to several family members (e.g., both parents 
and grandparents) contributing to a single child's schooling, resulting in higher education expenditures 
per child. In addition, the high cost and limited availability of quality ECE in countries such as Japan 
has been identified as a contributing factor to declining birth rates in the country. 
The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of some of the key markets around the world, which 
KUE views as attractive. These include China, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. 
8.5.1 China: Market Overview 
With a population of 274 million children under a9e 15, and a fertility rate of 1.73, China represents an 
attractive market for early education providers.3u In China, mandatory education starts with primary 
schools, at which most children enroll by age six. Currently, 24 million Chinese children are attending 
kindergarten as a growing middle class and the one-child policy are driving multiple incomes to one child 
and increasing the amount of capital that can be dedicated to education. These socioeconomic factors 
are reflected in the increasing numbers of private kindergartens, which have grown at a rate of 13% over 
the past eight years.31

Schools tend to be concentrated in larger cities with Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao and Guangzhou 
being the largest pre-school markets. Kindergartens are divided into three categories: Bilingual, Foreign 
language and Mandarin. Bilingual kindergartens are typically joint ventures between Chinese and foreign 
entities or owned wholly by Chinese private or public entities. Tuitions for bilingual programs can reach 
$15,000 per year. Foreign language kindergartens are wholly owned foreign schools that recruit only 
foreign students and are typically backed by their embassies. These schools adhere to foreign 
educational standards with Mandarin being taught as a second language. The tuitions of foreign 
language schools range from $10,000 to $22,000 per year. Mandarin kindergartens are typically owned 
by Chinese public entities.

Kindergartens can be set up by the Ministry of Education, private enterprises, universities, communities 
and individuals. While local governments establish the minimum and maximum fees allowed to be 
charged by public kindergartens, private schools are allowed to dictate reasonable tuition levels.

• Increasing in numbers over the past few years 
• Mostly run by locals, but foreign participation is on the rise 
• Quality and tuition vary considerably 
• Examples- Elizabeth Kindergarten (local), Victoria Wah Kwong

• Essentially a public service provided by the government 
• Typically low tuition (<US$5001yr), requiring substantial government 
subsidies

wants to reduce expenditure 
Saudi Arabia's nationwide public educational system comprises eight universities and more than 24,000 
schools. Open to every citizen, the system provides students with free education, books and health 
services. The government allocates over 25% of the annual State budget to education. 
According to the Ministry of Education, Saudi Arabia prizes education because of its critical importance in 
developing the country's human potential. Education is a central aspect of family and community life. 
Parents are deeply involved in their children's education, and the close links between home and school 
serve to reinforce the structure of the community and the nation. 
The government plans to increase the enrollment of 4 to 6-year-olds to 40% by 2014.32 Additionally, by 
royal decree, education is now required for all 4-year-olds. New labor laws also necessitate that 
companies employing 50 or more women provide daycare centers. Despite this new series of laws, there 
still only exist 1,200 kindergarten schools in Saudi Arabia (42% private and 58% public) to support the 
legislative pronouncements. The Company anticipates that, additional capacity will be needed to meet 
these social objectives. These trends, as noted by the Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia have led to 
private education facilities opening all over the Kingdom. 
8.5.3 United Kingdom: Market Overview 
The United Kingdom stands out with consistent rises in its investment in education, not just in absolute 
terms, but also relative to national income: Spending on educational institutions increased from 4.3% of 
GDP in 1990 to 5.5% in 1995 and 5.9% in 2002. From 1995 to 2002, spendin9 and enrollment in primary 
and secondary education has also increased by 36% and 21%, respectively.s3 Additionally, the country 
invests almost twice as much as any other country at the pre-primary level. The rate of participation of 4-

year-olds and under as a percentage of the 3-to-4-year-old population has also increased from 51% in 
1998 to 77% in 2002. 
The U.K. government is focused on the ECE industry and expects to spend $18 billion on child care 
schemes in the near future through Sure Start, an initiative designed to encourage additional 
participation in high quality childcare through extensive subsidies. The government's intention is to create 
3,500 additional children's centers in un-serviced, low-income communities.

9. KNOWLEDGE UNIVERSE EDUCATION (KUE) 
KUE is the third largest for-profit education company in the world. KUE currently operates in the U.S. and 
is the indirect parent company (87.6% ownerships') of KLC and also a major shareholder (owns 17.9% to 
40.0%35 of equity) of k12. In November 2005, KLC divided its business, with substantially all of its real 
estate owned by special purpose subsidiaries (KLC PropCo) and all of its customer contracts and 
operations remaining at KLC and certain other subsidiaries (KLC OpCo). 
The controlling shareholders of the General Partner are Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and Steven Green 
(collectively the Principals). Michael Milken and Lowell Milken each has more than two decades of 
experience in the education sector through involvement in several for-profit and not-for-profit initiatives. 
Steven Green, a former U.S. ambassador to Singapore, has more than two decades of experience as an 
international industrialist leading major corporate restructurings and expansions in manufacturing, 
housing, consumer products, retail and real estate enterprises. The Principals founded KUE and its 
affiliated companies over the past decade based on their vision of a world where competition for human 
capital is becoming the driving force of economic prosperity. KUE represents the Principals' sole vehicle 
for equity investment opportunities in the early education through secondary school sector going forward. 
The Company has an accomplished and internationally recognized leadership team. Led by the 
Principals, the Company has a prominent management team and advisory board with significant financial 
resources and substantial experience in the fields of education and real estate management. Additionally, 
through its past experiences at KLC, the Company has demonstrated the ability to acquire and integrate 
education assets. The Company's management consists of people with diverse backgrounds in 
operations, corporate finance, real estate, government relations and education. KUE's role will be to 
oversee the portfolio of operating businesses, identify acquisition candidates, hire top level management 
of the operating businesses and help the portfolio companies navigate some of the legislative and 
regulatory matters that exist in K-12 education. These services will be performed for the Company by 
KULG, for which KUE will pay $20.0 million annually to KULG in quarterly installments beginning July 1, 
2006 pursuant to the Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement. See Related Party Transactions. 
The General Partner plans to have a Board of Directors (the Board) with representatives from some of 
the countries KUE plans to expand into, public policy experts and independent directors with 
complementary backgrounds. KUE expects to benefit from the breadth and depth of the knowledge, 
experience and expertise of the Board. At the final closing of this offering, at least two members of the 
Board will be Independent Directors. After the Initial Listing of the Units and so long as consistent with 
contractual and licensing obligations, the General Partner will have a majority independent board.

9.2. Note Payable to KULG by KU Education, Inc. 
On January 6, 2005, KU Education, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of KUE (KUE Inc.) 
executed a promissory note in favor of KULG, an entity controlled by the Principals, in the amount of 
$200.0 million, the proceeds of which were used in connection with the acquisition of KinderCare by 
KLC. This note has a seven year maturity and accrues interest at the reference rate set by Bank of 
America plus 1.25% per annum. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without any premium or 
penalty. As of April 1, 2006, KUE Inc. owes approximately $183.9 million under the note. 
9.3. Term Loan Facility 
On March 29, 2006, Knowledge Universe Education LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (KUE 
LLC), entered into a six-month $150 million term loan facility with an affiliate of Credit Suisse, one of the 
Agents. The proceeds of the $150 million term loan were used to repay existing debt of KUE LLC to 
entities controlled by Michael Milken. 
The term loan facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by KUE LLC's direct and indirect parents and 
the parent guaranty is several. Upon contribution of assets to KUE by KUE LLC, KUE will become a co-
borrower. It is expected that this Term Loan Facility will be repaid with the proceeds of this offering. 
The term loan bears interest at either the reserve adjusted LIBOR rate plus 0.125% or the base rate 
(generally the applicable prime lending rate, as announced from time to time), at KUE's option and is 
secured by cash collateral. KUE is permitted to voluntarily prepay the term loan, in whole or in part, 
without premium or penalty, upon the giving of proper notice.

10. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF KLC's 
PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
In January 2005, KLC acquired KinderCare and incurred $540 million of term debt (the Acquisition Term 
Debt) and $250 million of subordinated bridge debt to finance the acquisition. At the time of the 
KinderCare acquisition, KinderCare had approximately $300 million of nonrecourse mortgage debt 
outstanding (the KinderCare CMBS Debt). KLC refinanced the bridge debt in February 2005 with $260 
million of 7-3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the Notes). In November 2005, KLC completed 
a transaction (the Real Estate Transaction) in which KLC divided its business, with substantially all of its 
real estate owned by special purpose subsidiaries (collectively, KLC PropCo) and all of its customer 
contracts and operations remaining at KLC and certain other subsidiaries (collectively, KLC OpCo). 
Management believes that this division represents the best way to analyze the business going forward. 
In connection with the Real Estate Transaction, KLC PropCo entities incurred $650 million of mortgage 
debt, $50 million of senior mezzanine debt and $150 million of junior mezzanine debt, which 
indebtedness is nonrecourse to KLC OpCo, the proceeds of which were primarily used to repay the 
Acquisition Term Debt and the KinderCare CMBS Debt, and KLC PropCo leased its owned centers back 
to KLC OpCo. See KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended 2005, 2004 and 2003 in Appendix B, KLC: Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended 
April 1, 2006 in Appendix C, KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended July 1, 2006 in Appendix D and Notes 11 and 21 to 
KLC's Financial Statements in Appendix E. 
The discussion below presents the pro forma results of consolidated KLC (KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo) 
as if the KinderCare acquisition and the Real Estate Transaction occurred on January 1, 2004. The pro 
forma results are not adjusted for the costs of operating KLC and KinderCare in parallel for a significant 
portion of 2005, or for restructuring costs incurred in combining the two businesses. These and other 
items are reflected as adjustments to EBITDA in our presentation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. 
Our pro forma results for KLC were not prepared in conformity with Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the 
SEC (which would not, among other limitations, permit a 2004 pro forma presentation after completion of 
our 2005 financial statements). In addition, by presenting a pro forma comparison, this discussion and 
analysis does not include a comparison of KLC's historical GAAP consolidated operating results or 
segment information that would be required by Item 3-03 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. The presentation 
of non-GAAP information herein does not purport to comply with Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or 
Regulation G of the SEC. For further information see KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended 2005, 2004 and 2003 in 
Appendix B, KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended April 1, 2006 in Appendix C, KLC: Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended July 1, 
2006 in Appendix D and the KLC and KinderCare GAAP financial statements in Appendix E. 
The pro forma presentation is not shown with adjustments to historical financial statements. Instead, it is 
based on a ground up combination of corporate level expenditures (overhead and capital expenditures) 
and internal financial statements derived from a center-by-center build up of KLC's results. The primary 
reasons for the presentation based on internal reports instead of KLC and KinderCare financial 
statements are the different fiscal year ends and expense classifications between KLC and KinderCare. 
The ground up analysis presented is consistent with management's view of the business. 
Key Operating Variables 
Net Revenue Trends and Drivers 
75 
The vast majority of KLC's net revenues are derived from center operations. The trends and drivers 
discussed below relate to such center operations. 
KLC derives its net revenues primarily from the tuition it charges for attendance by children at its centers. 
KLC's tuition rates and net revenues can be significantly impacted by the enrollment characteristics at its 
centers. Key factors include (1) geographic location, because KLC can command higher tuition rates in 
certain geographic areas; (2) the age mix of children enrolled, because tuition rates depend on the age of 
the child and are generally higher for younger children; (3) the mix between full- and part-time attendance, 
because KLC charges comparatively higher rates for part-time enrollment and (4) the level of participation 
in government subsidy and discount programs. 
KLC calculates its average weekly tuition rate as the actual tuition charged at centers that are open at the 
calculation date, net of discounts, for a specified time period, divided by average full-time equivalents, or 
FTEs for the related time period. KLC's FTEs are calculated by dividing net revenue by the center's 
undiscounted average pre-school tuition rate. FTEs do not necessarily reflect the actual number of full-
and part-time children enrolled. 
Tuition rates at KLC's centers are typically adjusted once per year to coincide with the back-to-school 
period. KLC typically collects tuition on a weekly basis in advance, the majority of which is paid by 
individual families. KLC provides discounts to government agencies, employees, families with multiple 
enrollments, referral sources and organizations KLC partners with for its employer-sponsored centers. In 
its employer-sponsored centers, tuition may be partly subsidized by such employers. 
Approximately 20% of KLC's net revenues are derived from tuition paid at varying levels of subsidy by 
government agencies. KLC's revenues are therefore affected by changes in the levels of government 
support for education, which are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions and resulting budget 
pressure at federal, state and local governments. 
KLC reports comparable center revenue trends based on the centers (other than the employer-sponsored 
centers operated for a management fee) that were open in both periods. Comparable center net revenues 
do not include revenues generated from centers that have been closed or sold. 
Utilization is a measure of the utilization of center capacity. KLC calculates utilization as the total actual 
child care revenues earned at centers that are open at the calculation date divided by the total potential 
child care revenue (based upon the center's undiscounted pre-school tuition rate and the center's total 
licensed capacity) during the related time period. 
In addition to tuition charges, KLC records revenues from fees and other income in a majority of its 
centers. KLC charges a reservation fee, typically at half of the normal tuition charge, for any full week that 
an enrolled child is absent from its centers. KLC also collects registration fees and fees to cover 
educational supplies at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter. KLC offers tutorial programs on a 
supplemental fee basis in the majority of our centers in the areas of literacy and reading, foreign 
language, mathematics and music. KLC also offers field trips, predominantly during the summer months, 
for an additional charge. KLC's centers earn other miscellaneous revenue from various sources, including 
management fees related to certain employer-sponsored centers. In addition to its child care operations, 
KLC's subsidiary, KC Distance Learning, sells high school level courses via online and correspondence 
formats and provides related instructional services directly to private students, as well as to cyber and 
traditional schools and school districts. 
Cost of Revenue — Trends and Drivers 
KLC's costs of revenue include the direct costs related to the operations of its centers. Labor related costs 
are the largest component of costs of revenue. KLC's time management and scheduling systems, which 
enable us to adjust staffing levels for peak and reduced attendance periods, allow KLC to manage its 
labor productivity without adversely impacting the quality of services within its centers. 
76 
Other costs recorded at the center level include rent, marketing, maintenance, utilities, transportation, 
classroom and office supplies, insurance and food. KLC's management believes its large, combined 
nationwide center base gives it the ability to leverage the costs of programs and services, such as 
curriculum development, training programs and other management processes. 
During fiscal year 2005, KLC experienced a reduction in projected claims costs for its self-insurance 
programs. However, management anticipates that premium and claims costs will continue to reflect 
market forces, which are beyond KLC's control. 
The Real Estate Transaction did not affect consolidated rent expense, but resulted in an increase of 
approximately $96.0 million in annual rent expense of KLC OpCo, which is leasing centers from KLC 
PropCo which now has title to substantially all of KLC's owned real property. 
Other Operating Expenses 
KLC's other operating expenses include the costs associated with the field management and corporate 
oversight and support of its centers and restructuring related expenses. Labor related costs are the 
largest component of KLC's general and administrative expenses. 
Seasonality 
New enrollments are generally highest during the traditional fall back to school period and after the 
calendar year-end holidays. KLC attempts to focus its marketing efforts to support these periods of high 
reenrollments. Enrollment generally decreases somewhat during the summer months and the calendar 
year-end holidays. 
Results Discussion 
Revenue increased to $1.48 billion in 2005, which represents an increase of $35.6 million over 2004. 
Gross margin was $340.7 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $11.1 
million, or 3.4%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA during the 52 weeks ended 
December 31, 2005, was $238.0 million which was $6.6 million, or 2.9%, above the same period in 2004.

Revenue. During the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, revenue increased $35.6 million, or 2.5%, 
over the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to tuition rate increases, which took effect 
in January 2005 and September 2005, offset by the impact of center closures and a slight decline in 
Utilization. However, during the third quarter of 2005 Utilization levels increased versus the same period 
in 2004, from 59.3% to 60.3%. This positive Utilization trend was repeated in the fourth quarter of 2005 
as levels rose to 59.2% versus 58.9% in the comparable period of 2004. Management believes these 
improvements reflect stronger economic conditions, strong back-to-school enrollments, marketing efforts 
and other management initiatives and programs. ECE revenue increased $24.9 million, or 1.8%, in the 
52 weeks ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period of 2004. On a same center basis 
(centers opened for more than one year), revenue increased 4.4% from 2004 to 2005.

Cost of revenue and gross margin. Gross margin for the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005 was 
$340.7 million, or 23.1% as a percentage of sales, compared to $329.6 million, or 22.9% in the prior year. 
Costs of revenue include the following: 
78 
• Salaries, wages and benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits were $734.9 million, or 49.7% as a 
percentage of sales, during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $725.0 million or 
50.3%, for the same period in 2004. 
• Rent Rent increased by $8.0 million to $121.1 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 
2005, compared to the same period in 2004. The increase in rent was largely due to a center sale-
leaseback program conducted by KinderCare during 2004, prior to its acquisition by KLC. Pro forma 
rent does not include $96.3 million of intercompany rent payable by KLC OpCo to KLC PropCo as a 
result of the Real Estate Transaction. 
• Other costs. Other costs include costs directly associated with the centers such as business 
insurance, food, marketing, maintenance, utilities, transportation and classroom and office supplies. 
Other costs were $281.0 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $274.4 
million in the same period last year. Other costs were 19.0% of revenue during both years. 
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses, which include costs 
associated with the field and corporate oversight and support of KLC's centers, were $126.0 million during 
the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $126.4 million for the same period in 2004. 
General and administrative expenses included the substantial majority of estimated temporary parallel 
organization costs of $28.1 million and $23.3 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively, as discussed below. 
Adiusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $238.0 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005 
compared to $231.4 million in 2004. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of slightly 
higher revenue and gross margin improvements enhanced by lower general and administrative costs 
before non-cash SAR accruals, net of restructuring charges and parallel organization costs. The table 
summarizes KLC's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA as defined in KLC's existing revolving credit 
agreement. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a discussion of our use of performance measures

Management fee paid to affiliate entities. 
Restructuring charges. Restructuring charges during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, were 
$29.4 million. Included in the $29.4 million of non-recurring integration costs were $11.0 million of 
severance costs that resulted primarily from the closure of KLC's former corporate offices at Golden, CO. 
Additional restructuring costs in 2005 were the result of consulting, temporary contract-based labor and 
other charges. Restructuring charges in 2004 were $5.1 million and were related to KLC's acquisition of 
AER in May 2003. 
Parallel Organization Costs. For much of 2005 KLC was burdened with the central operations and 
infrastructure of both KinderCare and KLC. KLC has defined parallel organization costs as the cost of 
maintaining these duplicative corporate functions during the overhead rationalization associated with the 
KinderCare acquisition. KLC believes that approximately 70% of parallel organization costs are related to 
salaries. Remaining parallel organization costs are related to upkeep, maintenance and utilities at 
corporate facilities. During the first month of 2006 parallel organization costs had been reduced to 
$174,042 (annualized run-rate of $2.1 million) compared to an estimated $23.3 million in 2005. 
Parallel organization costs for the 2004 fiscal year are estimated based on an annualized run-rate based 
on the costs incurred during the first month following the KinderCare acquisition. During that month 
(January 2005), KLC incurred approximately $2.3 million of parallel organization costs ($28.1 million on 
an annualized run-rate basis). 
Interest. Interest expense in 2004 and 2005 is almost identical because both years are pro forma for the 
financings associated with the Real Estate Transaction, which refinanced the indebtedness incurred to 
finance the KinderCare acquisition. In 2005 pro forma interest expense of $89.9 million includes $5.1 
million of non-cash interest expense. Actual interest expense during the 2005 fiscal year was $80.7 
million which did not include $32.2 million related to the early extinguishment of debt.

Capital Expenditures. The following table shows the breakdown in KLC's projected capital expenditures:

New Centers 	26.4 	32.4 
IT Spending and Other Capex 	9.8 	14.0 
Total Capital Expenditures 	$70.6 	$83.1 
In 2004 and 2005, KLC spent $34.4 million and $36.6 million, respectively on maintenance capital 
expenditures, which includes refurbishment of its existing centers and equipment and supplies 
replacement costs. In addition, KLC spent $9.8 million in 2004 on corporate infrastructure improvements, 
primarily IT spending compared to $14.0 million in 2005. The remainder of KLC's capital expenditures 
was used to expand KLC's center base through both purchases of furniture, fixtures and equipment and 
construction of new owned centers.

11. THE OPERATING COMPANY (KLC OPCO) 
KLC's mission is to provide a quality education to children from birth to college. KLC was formed from the 
combination of KLC and AER which occurred in May 2003 and the subsequent acquisition of KinderCare 
in January of 2005. Based in Portland, Oregon, KLC consists of (i) KLC OpCo, a collection of operating 
companies and (ii) KLC PropCo, a collection of special purpose subsidiaries owning substantially all of 
KLC's real estate.

11.2. Early Childhood Education Unit (96% of Pro Forma FYE December 31, 2005 
Revenue) 
As of FYE December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo provided ECE services through its 1,812 company-operated 
community centers (90% of pro forma revenue) and 122 employer-sponsored centers (6% of pro forma 
revenue). In total the ECE Unit operated 1,934 centers in 39 states and Washington D.C., offering ECE 
programs primarily for children aged six weeks to five years. The programs are marketed primarily under 
the KinderCare, Children's World, Children's Discovery Centers, Knowledge Beginnings and Mulberry 
Child Care & Preschool brand names. 
KLC OpCo's centers typically contain classrooms, recreational areas, kitchens and bathroom facilities. 
The centers usually accommodate the grouping of children according to age. The centers have outdoor 
playgrounds, often with separate areas designed for infants and toddlers, with the exception of some 
downtown urban centers that may utilize nearby parks. Each center is equipped with a variety of audio 
and visual aids, educational supplies, games, toys and indoor and outdoor play equipment. In addition, 
most of the centers are equipped with personal computers with programs specifically designed for both 
pre-school and school-age children. The typical center can serve between 120-140 students, although 
actual enrollments can be higher as some children are enrolled on a part-time basis. Children are usually 
enrolled on a weekly basis for either full-day or half-day sessions. Most centers provide enrolled children 
with meals and two snacks. 
82 
KLC OpCo provides a wide range of quality programs that are continuously updated to reflect current 
thinking and to meet the needs of individual children. Programs have been developed in conjunction with 
nationally recognized experts in ECE and various curricula reflect the latest research in brain 
development. Programs stimulate the social, emotional, intellectual and physical needs of children and 
each program is age appropriate. 
KLC OpCo's ECE facilities are generally open throughout the year, usually five days a week, from 6:30 
a.m. to 6:30 p.m. New enrollments are most often highest in September and January, with the largest 
decrease in enrollment during holiday periods and summer months. Many centers offer summer day 
camp programs for children up to the age of 12. Additionally, many centers offer back-up care, which is 
offered in the event that the parent's primary child care arrangement is unavailable (e.g., when an in-
home provider goes on vacation). The company will provide short-term child care until the parent's child 
care resumes. 
Community Centers 
The 1,812 community centers are located in diverse demographic locations. Newly built centers tend to 
be located in the targeted demographic market of newer upper-middle class to upper income suburban 
areas with high concentrations of dual income families. In a community center, the current weekly tuition 
rates for full-day service range from $90 to $400 per child, depending upon the center location and the 
age of the child. KLC OpCo also offers tutorial programs in areas such as literacy, reading, foreign 
languages and mathematics in many of its centers for a supplemental fee and is exploring offering 
additional supplemental fee programs. Tuition is generally paid in advance on a weekly basis and, to a 
lesser extent, on a monthly basis. The company typically sets tuition for half-day programs at a 20% to 
40% premium compared with an equal number of hours for a full-day program. Approximately 20% of 
tuition is paid under state and federal subsidy programs. 
Employer-Sponsored Centers 
As of FYE December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo operated 122 corporate or employer-sponsored centers. 
These centers are typically free-standing, and are located at or near the premises or campus of the 
employer-sponsor. These sites are different from community centers in that they usually have more 
square footage per child and larger staff areas. Generally, the corporate sponsor provides the 
constructed building. KLC OpCo currently has relationships with a diverse group of employers, including 
hospitals, health care facilities, government agencies, and private sector companies. Its corporate 
relationships include, but are not limited to, the following: AOL Time Warner, TRW, Lockheed Martin, the 
World Bank Group, Fox, Maytag, Northrop, TJ Maxx, the National Security Agency, the Mayo Clinic and 
Stanford University. 
Employer-sponsored centers are operated either on a fixed-fee basis (31 centers) or on a profit-and-loss 
basis (91 centers). Under the former, KLC OpCo receives a fixed fee per month, typically irrespective of 
occupancy. In these contracts, the Company collects tuition on behalf of the employer sponsor. Under a 
profit-and-loss contract, KLC OpCo collects tuition for its own account, generally with no guaranteed fees 
from the employer. In some cases, its operations are subsidized by the employer, typically in the form of 
tuition subsidies, free or reduced rent, the provision of certain services such as maintenance, landscaping 
and janitorial services or enrollment guarantees. This enables the company to utilize the subsidies for 
improved staff quality and teacher / child ratios. 
Contract terms typically average between one and five years. Normally the management centers are 
reserved for children of the corporations' employees. Some contracts provide for accepting non-
employee children, for which the company can often charge a higher tuition. 
83 
11.3. School Partnerships Unit (3% of Pro Forma EYE December 31, 2005 Revenue) 
Through the School Partnerships Unit, KLC OpCo provides customized before and after school 
educational enrichment and recreational programs for school age and preschool children in partnership 
with elementary schools. KLC OpCo provides these partnership services primarily through 573 sites in 20 
states. Average tuition ranges from $35—$75 per week, payable in advance. Parents account for 94% of 
total tuition received, while state and grant subsidies account for the remaining 6%. 
These before and after school programs are typically conducted in collaboration with public schools and 
located on-site at public school campuses. The success of the programs has led to the development of 
summer camps, remedial programs, and drop-in care. Programs are operated under the Champions 
name. Because each program is relatively small (approximately 40 children per program), operating 
costs associated with running each program are minimal. Little or no capital investment is required and 
the contracting school typically provides on-site space for the program. Contract tenures range from one 
year to evergreen. They often stipulate that KLC pays minimum fees to the elementary schools for use of 
facilities. 
KLC OpCo's November 2004 acquisition of EdSolutions, Inc. (ESI) provided it entry into the 
Supplemental Education Services (SES) tutoring business. The SES business is part of the federal No 
Child Left Behind Act's effort to improve the performance of students at failing schools. KLC OpCo 
operates 72 SES sites. ESI is approved to provide SES in 19 states and our plans call for ESI to serve as 
a platform for future growth for KLC. 
11.4. Distance Learning (1% of Pro Forma FYE December 31, 2005 Revenue) 
Through its wholly owned subsidiary, KCDL, KLC OpCo also operates accredited high school distance 
learning programs that have served over 200,000 students since 1975. Based in Portland, Oregon, 
KCDL operates Keystone National High School and iQ Academies. Keystone National High School is 
one of the largest and most experienced accredited high school distance learning programs in the country. 
Keystone is a private, diploma granting school with parents or schools paying for individual courses 
and/or complete curriculum. Keystone served over 14,000 students in 2005 and offers more than 60 
distance learning courses. iQ Academies develops and manages online charter schools. It currently 
operates one school in Wisconsin, is working on the approval process for another charter in California, 
and has plans to begin several more charters in the next 12 months. iQ Academies provides support 
required to launch and operate an online high school including curriculum, instruction, technology, 
marketing and support. Though only 1% of KLC OpCo's pro forma revenues, KCDL is highly profitable 
and accounts for almost 2% of KLC OpCo's pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. 
11.5. Business Strategy 
KLC OpCo's strategy is to drive revenue growth and enhance profitability through a combination of the 
following initiatives: 
• Expansion of existing business lines. Management believes that the opportunity exists to significantly 
expand the scope of its existing business lines: 
— Community centers. KLC OpCo has substantial experience in selecting and opening new 
community centers. Over the next six years KLC OpCo plans to open 195 new centers which are 
expected to generate approximately $200 million of gross revenue. 
Employer-sponsored centers. KLC OpCo expects to continue the expansion of its employer-
sponsored centers. Over the next six years KLC OpCo plans to open 124 new centers with gross 
revenue of approximately $120 million. 
54 
• Rationalize centers to improve overall strategy and quality of network Management closely monitors 
underperforming centers and looks to rationalization opportunities which generally lead to improved 
Utilization and higher EBITDA generation. 
— As part of its rationalization, KLC OpCo has identified 50 centers which it intends to close and will 
continue to evaluate underperforming centers. As a result, over the next six years KLC OpCo 
expects to close approximately 250 centers with a decrease in revenues of approximately $120 
million. While the closure of underperforming centers decreases KLC OpCo's revenue, 
rationalization is expected to increase both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins. 
• Strategic acquisitions. The childcare market remains highly fragmented with for-profit chains 
comprising only 5% of the entire market. There are over 386,000 family-owned and operated centers, 
with each providing services to fewer than 13 children. KLC OpCo believes there are many 
opportunities to consolidate some of the family-run centers as well as some of the larger regional 
providers. 
• Offer new products and services. KLC OpCo estimates that it services more than 200,000 families in 
a given year. KLC OpCo's scope of operations makes it ideally positioned to market other products 
and services through its learning centers. KLC OpCo has already sold several additional lines of 
educational products and services at test locations including supplemental phonics, math, Spanish 
and music courses. KLC OpCo believes that product and service lines can be expanded to include 
additional educational and non-educational offerings such as medical insurance and student financing 
programs. 
• Initiation of the Spirit of Service Program. The fundamental assumption of the Spirit of Service 
program is that sales are not separate from service—both are driven by relationships. To that end, the 
Spirit of Service program was designed to promote revenue growth by building a sales-oriented culture 
while increasing customer / parent engagement. Currently, KLC OpCo's management team is working 
with consultants from Cypress Consulting and the Gallup Organization to: 
— Understand and evaluate current practices and expectations regarding sales and service; 
— Provide reliable data to help grow enrollments through a better understanding of families who have 
disenrolled and KLC OpCo's current customers; 
— Develop the sales and coaching skill necessary to support requisite practices and behaviors; and 
____ Institutionalize practices, systems and incentive plans to ensure a sustainable focus and culture 
built around sales and customer service. 
11.6. Sales and Marketing 
Early Childhood Care and Education 
Community Centers. KLC OpCo's target market is middle-class to affluent ($70,000+ household income), 
highly educated parents working or residing near the center. Target parents are white-collar workers and 
are usually dual-income families. KLC looks for sites where it believes the market for its services will 
support tuition rates higher than current average rates. 
Management believes KLC OpCo distinguishes its services by developing and introducing high quality 
curricula and programs that incorporate both learning and enjoyable activities held in a safe and 
child-friendly environment. KLC OpCo markets its services through online channels (including strategic 
click through advertisement placements), as well as traditional methods, such as display advertisements, 
listings in the yellow pages, newspaper advertisements, distribution of flyers at schools and community 
functions, and center open house events. KLC OpCo spends a large portion of its advertising budget 
during the summer months in anticipation of the fall enrollment period, with continued advertising 
throughout the year. The primary source of new enrollments is recommendations from customers in the 
communities in which KLC OpCo operates. Center directors are also involved in the marketing process 
85 
by encouraging parental involvement in the centers through monthly newsletters and reports, 
parent-teacher conferences and parental visits to, and inspections of, the centers. 
Although most of the marketing efforts are performed at the field level, corporate headquarters assists 
centers in developing marketing programs, designing campaigns, preparing marketing brochures, 
strengthening the brand name, identifying strategic partners, and providing advice on ways to advertise 
and market the programs at the local level. In addition, KLC OpCo is actively involved in teaching the 
staff and directors business enhancing skills, such as cost management, local marketing and customer 
relations. 
Employer-Sponsored Centers. Services that KLC OpCo provides to employers include onsite and near-
site center operation, backup care, discount programs, holiday care and consulting services. KLC OpCo 
has dedicated sales personnel focused on expanding its presence in this market. It also markets its 
services through relationships with consultants, attendance and presentations with clients at trade shows, 
networking at conferences and through industry alliances and publications. KLC OpCo responds to 
requests for proposals, referrals from current clients and prospects to targeted mid-market centers for 
transition opportunities through mailings and networking. It also targets Fortune 1000 companies for its 
discount and nationwide backup care services which serve large distributed workforces. 
Marketing to employers or corporate sponsors largely takes place at the corporate level. KLC OpCo 
markets to parents through its employer sponsors and occasionally through contracted resource and 
referral agencies. KLC OpCo is finding that the preferred method is through electronic brochures and 
messages as well as dedicated websites for onsite centers and services. KLC OpCo provides hardcopy 
materials and promotional giveaways primarily through employer-sponsored benefit fairs and events on 
client campuses. The centers engage parents and potential parents through brown bag lunch seminars, 
open houses, and visibility tables in client cafeterias and common areas. 
School Partnerships 
Champions Programs. KLC OpCo positions its Champions school age, preschool and summer programs 
as exciting combinations of learning and fun. It relies primarily on a regional, direct sales force in 
effecting a two tiered sales and marketing approach. The first tier consists of selling the Champions 
service at the appropriate administrative level in the school. This selling generally occurs at the 
superintendent or principal level. Selling to administrators is necessary since the majority of Champions' 
programs rely solely on the use of existing school infrastructure. The- sales and marketing effort in this 
tier involves participation in trade shows, featured articles in trade journals, trade magazine advertising 
and news releases. KLC OpCo believes that these efforts have been successful in heightening brand 
awareness, and as such, has enabled its sales force to gain access to entire districts versus individual 
schools. 
Once a Champions program receives the endorsement of the appropriate decision-maker, the second tier 
of the sales and marketing effort begins, which targets the parents of children attending the sponsor 
school and, in some cases, nearby schools. Marketing is conducted primarily through flyers, open 
houses and school newsletters. 
Supplemental Education Services. The sales and marketing process for SES tutoring involves several 
steps. First, KLC OpCo must seek approval to provide services in a state through a request-for-proposal 
process. This process entails detailed descriptions of the curriculum provided and how it correlates with 
state standards, testing and accountability, the operational model to be provided and company 
background information. Once approval is obtained at the state level, KLC OpCo contacts districts it is 
interested in serving, and requests that it be added to the list of approved providers. At the same time 
that it makes the initial contact with districts, it also contacts local schools, often through such schools' 
SES coordinator, and subsequently with the parents at each school. 
Once KLC OpCo has been approved by the state, district and the schools, it competes with multiple SES 
providers selling to individual parents, who are the ultimate decision makers in terms of selecting a 
86 
provider. Many providers are currently offering incentives to children and families to enroll with them and 
some are offering incentives to schools as well. The key challenge in marketing the SES programs to 
families is offering something that is appropriate and that will add educational value for families while 
enticing the children to participate. KLC OpCo believes there is a much larger number of children eligible 
for services than the number that attend programs and therefore an opportunity exists to improve 
marketing and outreach to families. 
Identifying prospects involves targeting urban areas where there is a cluster of failing schools. Failing 
schools are schools that fail to meet established NCLB requirements for three years in a row. After the 
second year of failure the schools have to offer several services in order to prevent being named a failing 
school. This enables KLC OpCo to project the approximate number of schools that will be considered 
failing in the next school year and help identify states to pursue and markets that warrant further attention. 
KLC OpCo is currently authorized to provide SES in 19 states and has already begun providing SES in 
five of them. KLC OpCo believes the SES business provides an opportunity for growth. 
On August 29, 2006, KLC acquired 100% of the membership interests in Education Station, LLC 
(Education Station) from Catapult Learning LLC (Catapult), a subsidiary of Educate, Inc. (together with 
Catapult, Educate) Education Station is a private provider of supplemental educational services under 
the NCLB and other educational instruction and after school services. The purchase agreement provides 
for an aggregate purchase price of $6.0 million with $3.0 million paid into escrow at closing, and $1.0 
million payable on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date. The amount in escrow is 
payable to Educate on three specific dates during the period beginning ninety days from the closing date 
and ending on July 31, 2007 upon the renewal by Education Station of certain contracts which were in 
place applicable to the 2005-2006 school year. Also on August 29, 2006, KLC and Educate entered into 
a technology license agreement where Educate granted a license to KLC of certain proprietary software 
used in providing real-time online NCLB services. The term of the license agreement is four years and 
provides for a license fee of $10 million payable in three installments of $3.0 million within 30 days 
following each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date and a final installment of $1 million within 
30 days following the fourth anniversary. KLC believes that the acquisition of Education Station makes it 
the largest for-profit provider of supplemental education services under the NCLB in the U.S. 
Distance Learning 
KLC OpCo markets its distance learning products to two distinct customer groups: the home school 
market and schools. Purchases made into the home school market are driven by web-based marketing 
efforts and trade associations along with a direct mail campaign. Purchases made by schools are 
marketed to counselors and administrators through direct mail and telemarketing efforts. 
11.7. Curriculum 
KLC OpCo believes that it can increase enrollment in its centers by continuing to develop and introduce 
high quality curricula and programs that provide parents with meaningful reasons to choose the centers 
for their children over other alternatives. It has designed research-based, proprietary curricula for age-
specific educational and recreational programs to develop a child's social, intellectual and physical skills 
and distributed curriculum manuals for each age group to its centers. These programs are used as a 
framework, within which individual teachers have flexibility to create daily instruction opportunities that are 
tailored to the needs of each class. 
The curriculum covered by the Early Foundations program is carefully designed to support school 
readiness. Activities are developed and implemented based on an expansive, research-based framework 
of educational objectives. These objectives mirror well documented early learning standards. Frequent 
assessment insures both program quality and desirable child outcomes. 
57 
The Early Foundations program focuses on providing individual learning opportunities that are flexible 
and appropriate to each child's development level. KLC OpCo believes that the Early Foundations 
program distinguishes the Company from other child care providers. 
11.8. Management Team and Board of Directors 
KLC OpCo is led by a highly experienced management team comprised of experts in the field of 
education, as well as business professionals. This combination of talent is expected to drive continued 
success of KLC OpCo. These individuals are also supported by a seasoned executive and middle 
management team with average Company tenure of ten years. The following table sets forth KLC OpCo's 
management team and the board of directors of its parent company, KSI. Detailed biographies can be 
found in Appendix A.

11.9. Employees 
As of December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo employed approximately 40,000 non-unionized personnel. Of the 
total amount, 39,639 are employed at the field level (including teachers and center staff, center directors, 
facilities and field and regional staff) and 592 are employed at the corporate level. Given the seasonality 
of the child care business and the regulated teacher-student ratio that varies by age with each state, 
approximately 16.5% of the total field personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Teachers and 
teaching assistants, which account for 93% of the total employee pool, are paid on an hourly basis. Most 
of KLC OpCo's remaining employees, including District Managers as well as most corporate staff, are 
salaried. KLC believes that its relations with its employees are good. 
KLC OpCo's management believes that its below-industry average turnover rates are a result of its hiring 
practices and closer involvement in center operations, a focus on treating teachers as educators and not 
just employees, and comprehensive training programs that are designed to ensure that teachers are 
successful. KLC OpCo believes that it has the opportunity to reduce employee turnover further through 
improved recruiting, training and management. 
The following table presents 	a breakdown of employees as of December 31, 2005: 
KLC Employee Breakdown 
Employee Type 	Number 
Teachers and Center Staff 	37,440 
Center Directors 	1,874 
Corporate 	592 
Facilities 	218 
Field / Regional Staff 	107 
Total 	40,231 
11.10. Accreditation 
KLC OpCo pursues accreditation of its centers by accrediting bodies, primarily the National Association for 
the Education of Young Children (referred to herein as NAEYC), the nation's leading child care 
accreditation body. NAEYC accreditation criteria cover a wide range of quantitative and qualitative factors, 
including, among others, faculty qualifications and development, staffing ratios, health and safety and 
physical environment. NAEYC criteria generally are more stringent than state regulatory requirements. As 
of December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo had 831 or approximately 43% of its total ECE centers that were 
accredited by NAEYC. Of the approximately 117,000 licensed centers in the U.S., approximately 10% 
are accredited by NAEYC. 
Management believes that substantially all of its centers' operations and policies adhere to or are 
substantially compliant with NAEYC accreditation requirements. Since the accreditation process is 
expensive, KLC OpCo intends to seek accreditation only where it believes accreditation will provide 
meaningful local marketing benefits or competitive advantages. 
11.11. Licensing and Government Regulation 
Each early childhood care and education center and most school programs must be licensed under 
applicable state or local licensing laws. Responsibility for licensing and compliance with government 
regulations is at the regional and local level. Licenses are held at the center level or by the school 
program and are typically good for a minimum of one year. Generally, the center or school program will 
89 
reapply for a license on an annual basis, and that process may include a visit from the applicable state 
regulator. Renewal of a license is generally a fairly routine process. 
In addition, each ECE center or school program is subject to a variety of state and local regulations. 
Although these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, governmental agencies generally 
review the safety, staff qualifications, fitness and adequacy of the buildings and equipment; the ratio of 
staff to children; the dietary program; the daily curriculum and compliance with health and transportation 
standards. In most jurisdictions, these agencies conduct scheduled and unscheduled inspections of 
locations. Repeated failures by a location to comply with applicable regulations can subject it to 
sanctions that might include probation or, in more serious cases, suspension or revocation of the center's 
or program's license to operate and could also lead to sanctions against the Company's other centers or 
programs located in the same jurisdiction. In addition, this type of action could lead to negative publicity 
extending beyond that jurisdiction. 
KLC OpCo generally seeks to operate centers and school programs in states with strict regulations in 
order to avoid unexpected expense and market disruption that may be caused by compliance with 
regulations adopted in states that previously lacked such regulations. 
KLC OpCo believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all material regulations 
applicable to its business. However, a licensing authority may determine that a particular center or school 
program is in violation of applicable regulations and may take action against that center or program and 
possibly other centers in the same jurisdiction. In addition, there may be unforeseen changes in 
regulations and licensing requirements, such as changes in the required ratio of child center staff 
personnel to enrolled children, which could have a material adverse effect on KLC OpCo's operations. 
States in which KLC OpCo operates routinely review the adequacy of regulatory and licensing 
requirements and implement changes which may significantly increase its costs to operate in those states. 
The SES programs are operated in substantial compliance with the federal No Child Left Behind Act, as 
well as applicable state Department of Education regulations that vary from state to state, but generally 
regulate curriculum, staff qualifications, and program quality and effectiveness. KLC OpCo must receive 
approval from each state's Department of Education in order to qualify as an SES provider. The length of 
approval to be an SES provider varies, but is typically from one to five years. Repeated failure by an SES 
provider to comply with regulations or its request for proposal documentation may cause the provider to 
lose its approval. 
Federal regulations and licensing requirements require compliance with minimum standards in order to 
qualify for participation in federal assistance programs. Under the Social Security Act, the U.S. federal 
government has established programs to assist low-income families with early childhood care and 
education expenses. These programs include the Childcare and Development Block Grant and At Risk 
Program. Funding is typically provided through block grants to states and counties, which then 
administer the programs through local agencies. 
The federal Americans with Disabilities Act, referred to as the ADA, and similar state laws prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Compliance with the 
ADA requires that public accommodations reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that 
new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless 
structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance 
with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private 
litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. KLC OpCo has not 
experienced any material adverse impact as a result of these laws. 
Section 21 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), provides for an income 
tax credit ranging from 20% to 35% of certain child care expenses subject to certain maximum limitations. 
The fees paid to KLC OpCo for early childhood care and educational services by eligible taxpayers qualify 
for the tax credit, subject to the limitations of the Code. In addition, Section 45F of the Code provides 
90 
incentives to families and employers to offset costs related to employer-provided child care facilities. 
However, these tax incentives are subject to change. 
KLC OpCo is also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum 
wages, overtime compensation and working conditions. All of KLC OpCo's employees are paid at rates 
equal to or higher than the federal minimum wage. 
KLC OpCo is also subject to laws regulating its transportation of children. In 1998, the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, issued interpretive letters stating that automobile dealers may no 
longer sell 12 to 15-passenger vans intended to be used for the transportation of children to and from 
school by child care providers and that any vehicle designed to transport 11 persons or more must meet 
federal school bus standards if it is likely to be used significantly to transport children to and from school 
or school-related events. These interpretations and related changes in state and federal transportation 
regulations have affected the type of vehicle that the company may purchase for use in transporting 
children between schools and its centers and, in effect, required KLC OpCo to replace its remaining fleet 
of vans with school buses over time. These changes have increased the company's costs to transport 
children because school buses are more expensive to purchase and maintain and, in some jurisdictions, 
require drivers with commercial licenses. 
11.12. Insurance 
KLC OpCo's insurance program currently includes the following types of policies: workers' compensation, 
commercial general liability, automobile liability, property, excess umbrella liability, directors' and 
officers' liability and employment practices liability. These policies provide for a variety of coverages, 
which are subject to various limits, and include substantial deductibles or self-insured retentions. Special 
insurance is sometimes obtained with respect to specific hazards, if deemed appropriate and available at 
a reasonable cost. Claims in excess of, or not included within, KLC's coverage may be asserted or 
coverage may not be available due to insurance company failures or other reasons. 
KLC OpCo maintained either a self-insured retention or a deductible for a portion of its general liability, 
workers' compensation, auto, property and employee medical insurance programs. It purchases stop 
loss coverage in order to mitigate its potential future losses. The nature of these liabilities, which may not 
fully manifest themselves for several years, requires significant judgment. KLC OpCo estimates the 
obligations for liabilities incurred but not yet reported or paid based on available claims data and historical 
trends and experience, as well as future projections of ultimate losses, expenses, premiums and 
administrative costs. While the company believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations are 
sufficient, any significant increase in the number of claims and/or costs associated with claims made 
under these programs could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
11.13. Legal Issues 
KLC OpCo does not believe that there are any pending or threatened legal proceedings that, if adversely 
determined, would have a material adverse effect on its business or operations. However, it is subject to 
claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims and litigation involving 
allegations of physical or sexual abuse of children. Although KLC OpCo cannot be assured of the 
ultimate outcome of the allegations, claims or lawsuits of which it is aware, it has not historically had to 
pay any claims exceeding its insurance coverage, and management believes that none of these 
allegations, claims or lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect 
on the Company's financial position, operating results or cash flows. In addition, it cannot predict the 
negative impact of publicity that may be associated with any such allegation, claim or lawsuit.

11.14. Real Estate 
As a result of a November 9, 2005 Real Estate Transaction, substantially all of the real estate owned by 
KLC OpCo was transferred to KLC PropCo. Although the expectation is that newly acquired real estate 
will be owned by KLC PropCo and leased back to KLC OpCo, KLC OpCo continues to be actively 
involved in new center design, development and management. In addition to development of new 
centers, the team is responsible for maintaining existing centers. The real estate group within KLC OpCo 
is headed by Wayne Pipes, Vice President. 
11.15. Environmental 
KLC OpCo is not aware of any existing environmental conditions that currently or in the future could 
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operating results or 
cash flows. It has not incurred material expenditures to address environmental conditions at any property. 
However, it has not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of its owned and leased centers. 
Consequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which it is unaware. 
In addition, future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability, and the 
current environmental condition of the centers may be adversely affected by conditions at locations in the 
vicinity of those centers (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties 
unrelated to the company. 
11.16. Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion 
The following summary historical and projected financial data should be read in conjunction with the 
financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of KLC's Pro Forma Results of 
Operations presented elsewhere in this Memorandum. See also Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
elsewhere in this Memorandum for a discussion of the derivation and limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and 
Adjusted EBITDAR. The historical information is pro forma for the effects of the acquisition of KinderCare 
in January 2005 and the separation of KLC into KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo in November 2005, as if 
those transactions and related financing had occurred on January 1, 2004.
