Comparison of Canadian Stock Markets
Similar to stock markets in the United States, Canadian stock markets vary significantly in terms
of their financial, liquidity and corporate governance requirements. Most Canadian publicly traded
cannabis-related companies trade on the CSE due to its less stringent requirements, as compared to the
TSX and TSXV. More than 10% of the companies traded on the CSE are cannabis-related companies.

CHAPTER VII
Capital Markets for Cannabis Companies
n Private Capital Markets
The cannabis industry today is replete with early-stage private companies seeking to raise capital. This
capital, whether equity or debt, may be available from (i) “friends and family,” (ii) more formalized
groups and networks of “angel” investors, (iii) family offices, (iv) dedicated cannabis investment funds
(currently few in number, but growing), and (v) strategic investors. However, because of the legal
considerations, traditional institutional investors—most notably the venture capital and private equity
communities—continue to be mostly absent from the market.
As with most early-stage companies in other industries, many emerging cannabis-related companies
are trying to follow the typical progression of raising equity capital, as illustrated in the following chart.
Equity Financing Progression for Cannabis-Related Companies

Family

The following table provides a summary of the reported capital (equity and debt) raised by private
cannabis-related companies in 2016 and year to date through November 30, 2017. While the table
indicates that significant capital is available in the private markets, we believe that the dearth of acces -
sible institutional capital makes it challenging for many companies to raise subsequent rounds of financing
after successfully securing their start-up capital. In addition, the amount raised per transaction is
small and there have been very few announced financings of meaningful size by private companies.
While we believe that the data is informative, it is challenging to get accurate and comprehensive data
for the number and dollar amount of transactions that occur in private markets within the cannabis
industry because of the number of transactions that are not reported.

CHAPTER VII
Capital Markets for Cannabis Companies
In addition, an increasing number of direct lenders are participating in the private debt markets
for cannabis-related companies. These lenders represent an important capital source for the industry,
as typical forms of debt capital, such as bank financing, remain unavailable to most companies. As in
other industries, debt financing is typically available only to those companies having meaningful cash
flow or tangible assets to secure the debt. While the number of lenders is increasing, there is still a
relative scarcity of debt capital available to the cannabis industry, which can lead to a higher debt cost
of capital of 200–500 basis points or more for cannabis-related companies, as compared to companies
in other industries.
The following chart illustrates the type of debt that may be available to cannabis-related companies,
representative terms of such debt, and the types of companies that may be able to access debt in the
private markets.

n Final Thoughts
As stated previously, valuations and stock price fluctuations in the cannabis industry continue to be
driven more by expectations for the cannabis industry in general than by individual company fundamentals.
Today, in the public markets, trading volumes are too low, trading prices are too volatile and
operating histories are too limited to place any reliance on current valuation levels in the cannabis
industry. We believe that this dynamic will continue until cannabis-related companies have matured
and start to realize meaningful revenue, profitability and other financial metrics that will allow investors
to evaluate companies within the industry by more traditional methodology.
It is still too early to know how the cannabis industry or its sectors will be valued in the future. It
may come to pass that companies in the cannabis industry are valued comparably to public companies
in industries with similar characteristics, such as the alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceutical and consumer
© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 135
Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017
products industries, especially as companies from those industries look to enter the cannabis industry,
through acquisition or by other means.
As demonstrated by the more than $2.0 billion raised by publicly traded and private cannabisrelated
companies in 2017, capital continues to be available to support the growth of the industry.
In the public markets, we believe that Canadian stock markets will continue to be the most receptive
globally (until more progress is made in the United States toward federal legalization of cannabis).

Although capital continues to be available for select issuers in both the public and private markets,
we believe that the cannabis industry will continue to face a large funding gap for the foreseeable
future, driven by the lack of institutional investors. However, we believe a growing number of retail,
institutional and family office investors will support the industry in 2018 and beyond.

CHAPTER VIII
Top 100
Private Cannabis Companies 2018
In this chapter, we present our current list of the Top 100 Private Cannabis Companies. Our determination
to include companies on the list is subjective, and the list is intended to be a cross-section of the
types of companies in the cannabis industry. Our list comprises privately held companies, primarily
U.S. companies, companies we believe have a strong reputation or position in their market segments
and companies pursuing a line of business we consider promising. We intend to update our list periodically,
and we expect it may change significantly over time.
Most companies on our list are in early stages of development, and many will need to raise capital to
succeed. Raising capital for early-stage companies in any industry is extremely challenging. Early-stage
cannabis companies seeking capital face the same challenges as early-stage companies in other industries
but must also address challenges unique to the cannabis industry. Although we hope the companies
on our list ultimately succeed, we expect some will go out of business for any number of reasons,
including lack of access to capital.
Inclusion in our list does not represent an investment recommendation or endorsement of any
particular company or product. We have made investments in and conducted investment banking and
other services for companies included in the Top 100 Private Cannabis Companies 2018 list, and may
do so in the future. Readers should be aware that we may have a conflict of interest that could affect the
objectivity of our decision to include a company in the list. For additional disclosures and disclaimers,
see page 175.

CHAPTER IX
Cannabis Industry Risk Factors
Companies in the cannabis industry are subject to many risks. The realization of one or more of these
risks could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of a company and
on its lenders, investors and principals. The following discussion highlights some, but not all, of these
risks.
Risks Related to U.S. Federal Law
• The manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of cannabis are strictly controlled
under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), irrespective of whether such activities comply with
applicable state law. Financial transactions in connection with cannabis-related violations of
the CSA may violate other federal laws. Individuals and businesses—including the principals,
employees, directors, agents, lenders and investors of such businesses—that violate the CSA or
such other laws are subject to fines, asset seizure and imprisonment under federal law.
• Federal statutes and policies that currently restrict or deprioritize enforcement of certain CSA
violations related to cannabis are subject to expiration, rescission and other changes. There can
be no assurance that in the future the federal government will not strictly and aggressively enforce
cannabis-related CSA provisions.
• If CSA controls applicable to cannabis are relaxed or repealed in the future, other federal laws
and regulations governing the production, distribution and marketing of products for human
consumption, such as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, may be more strictly enforced
by the federal government in relation to the cannabis industry.
• CSA controls and federal enforcement priorities applicable to cannabis both preclude interstate
commerce in cannabis and cannabis products. As a result, it can be costly or impractical for
companies in the cannabis industry to operate in multiple states and to gain economies of scale
through centralized operations.
© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 165
Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017
• Federal income tax law precludes a business that “consists of trafficking in” cannabis or cannabis
products from deducting certain operating expenses in determining its federal income tax. As a
result, businesses in the cannabis industry may have effective tax rates significantly higher than
other businesses subject to federal income tax, may owe tax on taxable income that is not actual
economic income generated by the business and may have tax liabilities in amounts that exceed
cash reserves.
• Because of CSA controls on cannabis and federal laws applicable to banks and other financial
institutions, companies in the cannabis industry may not be able to open or maintain bank
accounts or access products and services of traditional financial institutions, such as credit facilities,
payment processing and insurance coverage. A lack of access to banking and other traditional
financial products and services increases the time, effort and expense related to ongoing
operations and increases risks associated with cash transactions and the use of alternative products
and services.
• Trademarks used by companies to identify, distinguish or indicate the source of cannabis or
related products or services that are illegal under federal law are not eligible for registration under
federal trademark law, which is generally recognized as the most comprehensive trademark protection
available in the United States. Alternative means of protecting such trademarks may not
be available or may provide protections inferior to the protection provided by federal registration.
• Protections afforded under federal bankruptcy law generally are not available to companies whose
assets consist of federally illegal cannabis products or proceeds therefrom or to the creditors of
such companies.
• The federal government may pursue legal action against a state related to the state’s cannabis
laws, which may result in significant changes to the state’s legal landscape as it relates to cannabis
and may materially and adversely affect cannabis businesses in the state.
• Cannabis companies outside the United States whose business plans anticipate eventual access
to U.S. markets face uncertainty as to the timing or nature of changes in federal law that would
allow importation of cannabis products into the country.
Risks Related to U.S. State and Local Laws
• State laws and regulations that legalize or decriminalize cannabis and related activities are relatively
new and may change significantly or be reversed. The extent and nature of any such changes
are not foreseeable and may force cannabis companies to materially alter their business models,
suffer material losses or cease operations entirely.
• State and local laws may limit the number of cannabis businesses in the state or in a particular
locality, restrict the nature of such businesses (for example, by prohibiting for-profit cannabis
businesses) or place restrictions on the persons permitted to own or operate such businesses.
• Many state and local jurisdictions support legalizing or decriminalizing cannabis activities primarily
for the potential to generate tax revenue, and there is significant public pressure to impose
a heavy tax burden on those participating in the cannabis industry. State and local governments
may impose significant taxes on commercial cannabis activity and may do so unpredictably.
166 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC
CHAPTER IX
Cannabis Industry Risk Factors
• There is currently a lack of broad interstate reciprocity with respect to cannabis laws.
• Even in states where cannabis is legal under state law, local jurisdictions may impose bans or
restrictions that materially interfere with or effectively prevent the operation of cannabis businesses
within their boundaries.
Risks Related to the Manufacture and Sale of Cannabis Products
• Cannabis companies are exposed to various product liability claims associated with human consumption
of cannabis products, including claims that products cause injury, illness, possible side
effects or interactions with other substances, or that products include inadequate instructions for
use or warnings concerning health risks.
• Cannabis companies may be subject to product recalls for a variety of reasons, including product
defects, such as contamination. Such recalls may result in financial burdens and reputational
harm and may subject cannabis companies to increased regulatory scrutiny.
• Consumer perception of cannabis products can be significantly influenced by scientific research
or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding
the consumption of cannabis. Any unfavorable developments in these areas could have a material
adverse effect on the demand for cannabis products in general or on the products or prospects of
a particular company.
Risks Related to Early-Stage Cannabis Companies
• Most cannabis companies are in early stages of development and have limited operational history,
so it is difficult to accurately predict and forecast their business operations. Many cannabis
companies will fail.
• The success of many early-stage cannabis companies is premised on receiving and maintaining
the licenses, permits and regulatory approvals required for their proposed cannabis activities.
Many of such companies will not receive or maintain such licenses, permits and approvals or may
be able to do so only at significant expense.
• Cannabis companies’ access to the capital required to grow and to finance ongoing operations
involves challenges particular to the industry’s uncertain and rapidly evolving legal landscape.
Many early-stage companies in the cannabis industry will not be able to obtain the requisite
capital or will run out of capital prior to reaching profitability.
• Early-stage cannabis companies may experience unexpected problems in the areas of product
development and quality, manufacturing, marketing and general management, which, in some
cases, cannot be adequately solved. Companies may also be subject to product pricing and cost
pressures and to claims of intellectual property infringement.
© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA / SIPC 167
Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017
Other Risks to Companies in the Cannabis Industry
• The cannabis industry is extremely competitive in most segments, with certain companies having
unique competitive advantages such as greater capital resources, first-mover advantage, more
scalable business models and greater brand recognition.
• To date, the research conducted on cannabinoid-derived pharmaceuticals and other cannabisbased
therapies is limited. There is no assurance that cannabinoid-derived pharmaceuticals or
other medi cal products will prove effective in treating medical conditions or achieve broad market
acceptance.
• Given the emerging nature of the cannabis industry, there is a scarcity of qualified personnel with
deep industry experience and significant competition for such qualified personnel. Many cannabis
companies may not be successful in attracting, training, integrating, motivating or retaining
qualified management teams and other personnel.
• Cannabis is an agricultural product. The occurrence of diseases, insects, pests, mold and other
infestations and severe adverse environmental conditions, such as fire, drought, hail, flood or
frost, is unpredictable, may have a potentially devastating impact on agricultural production of
cannabis and may otherwise adversely affect the supply of cannabis.
• The cannabis industry is particularly vulnerable to rapidly changing technology, government
regu lation and relatively high risks of obsolescence caused by scientific and technological
advances. The success of cannabis companies will depend in part on their ability to anticipate
market, legal, technological and other trends in the industry. Many cannabis companies will fail
to accurately identify or predict industry trends.
• Cannabis laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the United States vary widely and, in
some cases, are as complex, contradictory and rapidly changing as those within the United States.
Cannabis companies operating outside the country’s borders are subject to risks related to the
unsettled legal environment applicable to cannabis.
• Due to federal controls on cannabis within the United States and similar restrictions in many
jurisdictions outside the country, there is a significant black market for cannabis products.
Government-regulated cannabis businesses face competition from black market partici pants and
are subject to different market forces than those of the black market.
