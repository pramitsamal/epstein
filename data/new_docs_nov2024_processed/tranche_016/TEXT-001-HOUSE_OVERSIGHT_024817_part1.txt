11 Cowen analysts across consumer, health
care, industrials, and regulatory offer a
comprehensive view of the global CBD
opportunity.
Nearly 7% of adults in our proprietary U.S.
survey (n = ~2,500) reported using CBD as a
supplement, far higher than we expected.
We believe U.S. CBD can conservatively
generate sales of $16 bn by 2025. We offer
detailed analysis at the sub-category level, as
well as company-specific discussions, including
Outperform rated WEED, TLRY, and TPB.

COWEN'S COLLECTIVE VIEW OF CBD - AHEAD
OF THE CURVE SERIES
THE COWEN INSIGHT
In a collaboration featuring 11 analysts spanning Cowen's consumer, health care, industrials
and regulatory teams, we offer a deep dive on the global cannabis market, with a particular
emphasis on the U.S. For consumer goods, we believe the U.S. CBD market could represent
a $16 bn opportunity by 2025.
$16 bn Consumer Opportunity (Azer, Blackledge, Charles, Chen & Kernan)
In our monthly proprietary consumer survey (n = ~2,500) we were surprised to see that
nearly 7% of respondents in January 2019 reported using CBD as a supplement. This strong
consumer interest is validated by the growing number of brands and form factors that are
now available through increasingly diverse retail channels, including Amazon, Sephora and
Neiman Marcus. That said, consumption of CBD on-premise will likely take longer, given
regulatory uncertainty. And, while our analysis primarily focuses on consumer staples
applications for CBD, it is interesting to see a growing number of specialty apparel brands
embrace hemp as a sustainable textile.
Retail sales of CBD consumer products in 2018 have been estimated between ~$600 mm
and $2 bn. By 2025, we believe CBD offerings could conservatively generate $16 bn in retail
sales (assuming a ~40% increase in consumer incidence, to 10%, and spend of less than $2 /
day). Our bottom-up analysis anticipates a diverse category, that is still led by traditional
health & wellness form factors (e.g., $6.4 bn in nutraceuticals, and $4 bn in topicals). And,
while likely smaller, we also expect categories like food, beverages, beauty and vapor to all
generate sales between ~$1-2.5 bn by 2025.
Herein, we offer a detailed look at category brand and pricing architecture in the U.S.
CBD market today, as well as detailed discussions of 21 public and private operators that
currently have exposure to the category, including Outperform rated Canopy Growth, Tilray
and Turning Point Brands, which have all announced plans to enter the U.S. CBD market.
The Science of CBD (Nadeau)
Cannabis’s therapeutic potential is attributable to the valuable overlap between
phytocannabinoids (i.e. plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid
system in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake.” While THC's activity in the body is
fairly well elucidated, CBD’s pharmacokinetics are less well understood (no specific receptor
for CBD has been identified). Clinical trial results to date demonstrate few adverse effects
from oral CBD doses of up to 1500 mg/day or up to 30mg IV. The scientific understanding
of CBD’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in specific indications, like epilepsy. GW
Pharma’s Epidiolex (highly potent, pure formulation of CBD) was approved by the FDA in
2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet
syndrome, and other companies (Tilray, MMJ Phytotech, Insys) have clinical trials underway
in seizure disorders as well.
CBD Hemp Cultivation (Neivert)
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 41 states have set up cultivation
and production programs to regulate the production of hemp. There is little research on
CBD hemp cultivation methods as hemp cultivation research historically has focused on
fiber and grain/seed. This lack of research, combined with a number of variables that affect
hemp for CBD yield, makes hemp for CBD cultivation much more art than science at this
point. That said, no other crop in the U.S. offers the type of return of the CBD Plasticulture
Model, and we would thus expect the country's two largest crops, corn and soybeans, to
lose some acreage to CBD hemp.

Synthetic Biology Provides Alternative Cannabinoid Production Method; Life Science Tools
Well Positioned To Benefit From QA/QC Testing Opportunity (Schenkel)
As an alternative to cultivation-based methods, cannabinoids can be produced using either
chemical or synthetic biology approaches. Synthetic biology methods, which harness
fermentation to produce cannabinoids, are particularly attractive considering they can
potentially produce a variety of cannabinoids while being highly scalable, efficient, and
environmentally friendly.
While QA/QC testing standards for CBD currently vary greatly by state (if any exist
at all), we expect Life Science Tools companies to benefit from this nascent market
opportunity as testing regulations are implemented and standardized. Similar to medical/
recreational cannabis testing, instruments such as mass spectrometers and liquid/gas
chromatographs are utilized to analyze CBD samples. Key vendors for mass spectrometry
and chromatography instruments include Agilent, Danaher (SCIEX), PerkinElmer, Shimadzu,
Thermo Fisher, and Waters Corporation.
CBD From a Retailer and Payor Perspective (Rhyee)
Healthcare: Drug Retailer Perspective: CBD products appear to be gaining traction with
independent pharmacies, many of whom are already selling or planning to sell CBD oils.
Independent pharmacies likely find the high-margin profile of CBD oils attractive, which
we suspect is similar to those of more traditional over-the-counter drugs, as well as the
differentiation it affords independents relative to larger chain pharmacies. For those selling
CBD oils today, the focus is on quality, particularly as it relates to bioavailability. Large
pharmacy chains, such as CVS and Walgreens, don’t currently sell CBD oil, but WBA noted it
is monitoring the CBD market.
Healthcare: Payor Perspective: Generally speaking, managed care does not cover OTC
products, with the same being true for Medicare and Medicaid. Based on our conversations
with a number of payors, whether CBD oils will be covered as a medical benefit by
government sponsored health programs is determined by the Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) and state governments. Currently, CBD products are not a covered
benefit, or an extra benefit, that has been approved by CMS or states, and it isn’t known
at this time whether CMS or states governments are considering reimbursement for CBD
products. Separately, Payors noted three factors complicating commercial coverage of
CBD oils, including (1) legal issues, as CBD oils derived from THC (cannabis) isn’t legal if
it contains equal to or more than 0.3% THC; (2) lack of regulation by the FDA; and (3) its
availability as an OTC medication.

Global Landscape (Azer)
While the global regulatory landscape varies, the CBD category outside of the U.S. has
been evolving rapidly, with more change likely to come with the WHO's current evaluation
of CBD, as well as its recent addition to the EU's Novel Food Catalogue. In Europe, CBD
products are now widely available in markets like the U.K., Italy and Switzerland, though
regulations vary with Italy allowing for cannabis light products, with allowable THC of as
much as 0.6%, while in Switzerland CBD products can have as much as 1% THC, and are
classified as a tobacco substitute. In Latin America, hemp has been in production since the
1500s is also rapidly expanding their regulatory frameworks around marijuana and hemp.
Canadian licensed producers have been actively entering the market in Latin America to
capitalize on this evolving opportunity, including Canopy Growth, Tilray, Aurora and Cronos.
Regulatory Outlook (Eric Assaraf - Cowen Washington Research Group)
The 2018 Farm Bill declassifies industrial hemp as a Schedule I substance, shifts regulatory
authority from the DEA to the Department of Agriculture, and provides autonomy for
states to regulate the industry. However, the new law does not change the FDA's oversight
authority over CBD products and FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has made it clear that
his agency will continue to step in when certain health claims are made. Additionally, FDA
has stated that CBD cannot be added to food products sold across state lines or marketed
as a dietary supplement, regardless of whether it is hemp-derived. The FDA will explore
new pathways for CBD to be sold legally; however, it seems clear that there will be a period
of regulatory uncertainty over CBD products at the state and federal level.

COWEN’S COLLECTIVE VIEW OF CBD
In a collaboration featuring 11 analysts across Cowen’s consumer, health care,
industrials and regulatory teams, herein we offer our outlook for the global CBD market,
with a particular focus on the U.S. While little science exists supporting medical efficacy
of CBD (with the exception of seizures, which GWPharma was able to prove with
Epidiolex for Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, as discussed in more
detail herein), the popularity of CBD products seems to be growing exponentially in the
U.S. Indeed, our consumer survey work suggest that close to 7% of adults in the U.S.
already use CBD as a supplement.
With the category gaining increasing interest from consumers we have seen a swell in
product innovation. And, the opportunity is increasingly drawing the attention of larger
competitors (where for instance, WEED announced that they would consider spending
as much as $500 mm in U.S. hemp / CBD). By 2025, we estimate that the U.S. CBD
market could approach $16 bn (from $600 mm -$2 bn in 2018).

2. The Science of CBD (Nadeau)

Consumer Products Market Sizing (Azer)
In our proprietary Cowen consumer survey (~2,500, 18+ respondents), we found that in
January 2019 close to 7% of respondents indicated that they use CBD as a supplement.
While this is only the first month’s reading of the data (which can fluctuate from month
to month), this initial response piqued our interest considerably, as it was much higher
than we would have suspected. Indeed, to put the 6.9% incidence rate in context, that
compares to JUUL use of 4.2%, and 19.6% of consumers that consider themselves a
current tobacco user, per our survey.
From a user perspective, category engagement not surprisingly skews younger, with use
among 18-24 and 25-34 year olds at over 9%, while it is below 4% for consumers 55+.

While the category remains nascent (with revenue estimates ranging from $600 mm to
$2 bn in 2018) it seems clear that the abundance of choice, which we discuss in more
detail herein, has been a key driver of that consumer engagement. In particular, we
were surprised to see that beverages already account for close to 20% of reported form
factor use, given that this segment is among the newer offerings in the market place.
Meanwhile, tinctures, which were arguably one of the original delivery systems, has a
dominant 44% share.

Figure 3 We Believe CBD Can Be a $16 BN Revenue Opportunity in the U.S. by 2025
While we are keen to gain more insights into the evolving use of CBD in the coming
months from our survey work, this initial snapshot offers a framework for sizing the
ultimate CBD opportunity. With growing consumer awareness, we conservatively
believe that CBD use can grow to 10% of adults in the U.S., or ~25 mm consumers (using
current population) by 2025. If we assume that the average consumer ultimately spends
$640 per year (or less than $2 / day), that would imply a $16 bn market opportunity for
CBD. We would note that using the U.S. Census 18+ population projection in 2025, a
10% incidence rate would equate to just over $590 in annual spend to achieve $16 bn.
Conversely, holding the $640 in spend constant with the U.S. Census forecasted
population would result in over $17 bn in revenues by 2025.
That said, we view this estimate as somewhat conservative, as we can envision a
scenario where a consumer that uses a CBD tincture or capsule, may also be inclined to
convert his or her beauty regimen to include CBD (e.g., CBD infused beauty products),
and or use a topical for targeted relief as well. Our $16 bn estimate assumes the
following category contributions:

The Science Of CBD (Nadeau)
The Endocannabinoid System
Cannabis’ therapeutic potential is due to this valuable overlap between
phytocannabinoids (i.e. plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid
system in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake.” However, though THC’s activity in
the body has been fairly well elucidated (it acts through G-protein coupled cannabinoid
receptor 1 and cannabinoid receptor 2), CBD’s pharmacokinetics are less well
understood (no specific receptor for CBD has been identified).
The scientific understanding of CBD’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in
specific indications, like epilepsy. GW Pharma’s Epidiolex (highly potent, pure
formulation of CBD) was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of seizures
associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, and other companies
(Tilray, MMJ Phytotech, Insys) have clinical trials underway in seizure disorders as well.
Additional possible indications for CBD products include autism spectrum disorders,
psychiatric conditions, diabetic neuropathy pain, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and back
pain; clinical trials in these indications are underway.
Clinical trial results to date demonstrate few adverse effects from oral CBD doses of up
to 1500 mg/day or up to 30mg IV. Specifically, CBD studies have not reported effects on
blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate, and no negative changes in mood or
psychomotor slowing. Some studies (such as GW’s in Epidiolex) have shown side effects
resulting from high doses of CBD (~2g/day) inhibiting hepatic drug metabolism,
prompting increased blood levels of some background medications. Additionally, in vitro
studies have shown CBD to be pro-apoptotic in lymphocytes and to inhibit IL8 and IL10
production, suggesting that it may suppress the immune system. However, though
unknowns remain, the summation of pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that the
compound is safe at typical doses seen in over the counter products (5-10mg).
Additionally, other cannabinoids (found in CBD distillate) have been discovered that may
have differentiated pharmacological effects. For example, cannabidivarin (CBDV) may
have differentiated anticonvulsant effects, tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) may have
anti-diabetic and appetite suppressant effects, cannabidiol-acid (CBDA) may have antinausea
effects, and bannabigerol (CBG) may have anti-cancer effects. Further research
is needed to elucidate the clinical effects of these compounds.

CBD Hemp Cultivation (Neivert)
2018 Farm Bill Legalizes Commercial Cultivation of Hemp: The 2018 Farm Bill legalized
industrial hemp at the federal level removing it from schedule I status under The
Controlled Substance Act. The bill defines industrial hemp as a variety of cannabis with a
THC concentration of </=0.3% and allows farmers to grow and sell hemp under state
regulation. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 41 states have
set up cultivation and production programs to regulate the production of hemp. (CT, ID,
SD, IA, OH, TX, LA, MS and GA do not currently allow hemp cultivation.)
Hemp is currently being grown under state Industrial Research Pilot Programs. Once
USDA rules are released, pilot programs may end in favor of USDA rules and rules of
state programs approved by the USDA.
Prior to the 2018 Farm Bill, the 2014 Farm Bill allowed universities and state
departments of agriculture to conduct hemp research under Agricultural Pilot Programs
in an effort to evaluate industrial hemp as a commercial crop. The bill allowed states to
begin research on best methods for hemp cultivation.
Cultivation Practices Of Hemp Dependent On Intended Harvestable Component
Hemp is grown for fiber, grain/seed and floral materials with different varieties of hemp
planted for each component. Fibers are used in rope and textiles, grain is used in human
food (not legal for animal feed), pressed seed oil from grain is used like sunflower seed
oil, and oils, including CBD, are removed from floral materials for health supplements.
Cultivation practices differ for fiber, grain/seed and CBD in an effort to maximize the
yield of the desired harvestable component. U.S. states have conducted pilot programs
in recent years to help gain a better understanding of best practices.
Limited Research Available On CBD Hemp Cultivation
There is little research on CBD hemp cultivation methods as hemp cultivation research
historically has focused on fiber and grain/seed. This lack of research, combined with a
number of variables that impact hemp for CBD yield, makes hemp for CBD cultivation
much more art than science at this point. Cultivation methods have been described as all
over the map. That being said, we detail methods from recent academic research studies
and conversations with industry participants below. (The University of Kentucky and
University of Vermont have both conducted research in CBD hemp cultivation in recent
years but further research is needed for conclusions regarding proper production
techniques.)

Hemp CBD Cultivation Steps:
�
�
�
Obtain a license. Growers must obtain a grower license from their state
department of agriculture for the specific type of hemp they want to grow.
Find a buyer/processor. Growers then need to find a buyer/processor for their
harvest as crops can only be sold to licensed processors.
Source seeds or clones. The grower must acquire seeds or transplants. Clones
(rooted cutting of a plant) can be used instead of seeds. The key factor in
selecting seeds or clones is understanding which strains produce flowers with
high CBD concentrations while keeping THC at </=0.3% since CBD and THC are
positively correlated which caps the CBD level. (A crop that exceeds 0.3% THC

will be destroyed.) Seeds that are certified (sold by domestic and international
hemp seed distributors) contain </=0.3% THC or produce hemp with </= 0.3%
THC.
CBD is more concentrated in female flowers (3%-6%) compared to male
flowers making male seeds unwanted. Unfertilized female flowers have been
found to produce higher CBD levels than female flowers fertilized by male
plants making male seeds unwanted in a production field. We note that seed
mix (male and female) costs are significantly lower than feminized seed costs
(incremental work is needed to increase the supply of feminized seeds).
Conversations with industry participants indicate that clones (first grown in a
greenhouse and then transplanted to the field) are becoming more common as
they provide a cheaper path to all female flowers in the field. Retail clones can
cost $4-$7 each and can be produced for $3 each with access to a greenhouse.
Test soil for contaminants. We note soil that has been used for corn production
has been cited as supportive for maximizing hemp yields.
Water System Installation. A drip irrigation is most effective way to water
hemp as it allows roots to breathe and conserves the most water.
Pesticides: Currently, pesticides are illegal for industrial hemp cultivation
which makes plastic mulch an important step. So far, disease pests and insects
have not been found to significantly impact yields.
Fertilizer. Fertilizer requirements similar to wheat are considered adequate
with nitrogen the most critical.
Planting. Adequate soil moisture and temperature (>/=50°F), which influences
timing for planting, is recommended for successful germination. Industrial
hemp can be planted in late April in Kentucky and late June in Vermont.
Planting depth for seeds should be ~0.50 inches.
Female seedlings, started in a greenhouse approximately 6 weeks prior to
planting, or transplanted female clones (planted with root structure), can be
planted into black plastic outdoors to control weeds. 5 ft x 5 ft plant spacing
has been found to be ideal and results in a population of 1,742 plants per acre.
Harvest. Average time to harvest a 6 inch clone is 90-120 days, Flower buds
from outdoor plants are removed by hand or using a debudder machine after
using a chainsaw or lopper to cut the plant down. Flower bud harvest is labor
intensive and can take ~30 hours per acre. Flower buds in a UVM study were
dried at 80°F for 18-36 hours until dry enough for storage without molding.
Indoor storage requirements creates a production challenge. As with most
crops, variations in yield can result from variations in genetics (variety), soil,
weather, and other growing conditions.
Testing. State Departments of Agriculture conduct field and greenhouse
inspections for THC levels, which is the only way to separate hemp from illegal
cannabis. Crops that test >0.3% THC will be destroyed.

Wide Range Of Returns On CBD
There is little data on economics for hemp CBD cultivation given wide range of outcomes
that can result on the seed vs clone decision (CBD levels vary for each and will impact
cost), as well as the type of production model used. The University of Kentucky (College
of Agriculture) recently published six budget models for industrial hemp producers. Four
of the six budgets address CBD hemp, with a separate budget for grain and another for
fiber. We highlight the University of Kentucky’s CBD Plasticulture budget model below
since it is the most profitable and will likely be the most commonly implemented. We
note all four of the CBD hemp models indicate a positive return above variable costs per
acre while hemp grain and hemp fiber do not reach breakeven due to low pricing for
both harvestable components..
University Of Kentucky’s Budget Assumptions For CBD Plasticulture:
�
�
�
Dry matter yield per acre: UK estimates 1,200 lbs of dry matter yield produced
per acre based on 1,500 plants per acre (recall 5 ft. 5ft. allows for up to 1,742
plant per acre) and 0.8 lb of dry matter yield per plant (yield per plant can
range from 0.5 lb-1.5 lbs).
Gross return per acre: CBD concentration and price per % are the factors that
determine the price of dry matter yield/lb. In the below example, 6% CBD% *
$5.00 per % = $30/lb. Gross return per acre is then calculated by multiplying
dry matter yield/lb by dry matter yield/acre (1,200).
Variable cost per acre: 72% of variable cost per acre is for clone transplants for
1,500 plants at $5.00 each. Other notable costs include planting, plastic to
protect against weeds, drip line for water, harvesting costs, cash rent and
application/test fees. We note clones currently can range from $3.50-$5.50
per plant. Clones have become more common than seeds in Kentucky as they
offer an easy way to produce female plants. A seed mix may be cheaper but
would include male seeds than can potentially pollinate female seeds and
negatively impact CBD concentration which influences pricing for dry matter
yield. Feminized seeds are an option but will likely be the most expensive
option. We note that the model assumes outdoor production rather than
greenhouse production since a greenhouse is efficient for clone production
(then transplanted to the field) but prohibitive for plant production.

CBD Hemp Clearly An Attractive Option For Growers. No other crop in the U.S. offers
the type of return of the CBD Plasticulture Model. We would expect the two largest
crops in the U.S.: corn and soybeans to lose some acreage to CBD hemp, though given
corn and soybean area planted was 89.1M and 89.2M acres respectively in 2018. (Total

increase in planted acres in 2018 (Sept) as well as the shift toward CBD as a percentage
of total hemp (planted acres for CBD rising to 4,121 acres in 2018 from 864 in 2017). In
2018, there were 158 greenhouses in Kentucky representing 764,000 sq. ft., which is
included in the 2018 acreage below. (Note 1 acre = 43,560 sq. ft.)
On January 22, 2019, the Kentucky Department of Agriculture approved 1,035

Outlook For Growth
The expected growth for hemp is supported by the economics offered. However, there
are limitations related to required cultivation methods.
Conversations with industry experts estimate planted hemp acres in 2019 could reach
200,000, up from 78,176 in 2018. The growth is supported by expansion like Kentucky’s
and new states entering the market (only 23 states participated in 2018).

Challenges For Growth
This report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.
We see several issues that we expect will moderate growth of hemp CBD in years to
come. As a commodity, we see economics diminishing as CBD supply rises with
increased acres along with higher costs for seed from increased seed demand. We also
see a lack of best practices for cultivation, storage restrictions and uncertainty about
the consistency of seeds/clones available increasing the probability that yields are
compromised.

Percent Of Total
Cannabinoid Content
Cannabinoids fall into three main types: (1) endogenous cannabinoids, which are
produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals; (2) phytocannabinoids, which
are isolated from plants; and (3) synthetic cannabinoids, which are produced in the
laboratory and may have some structural deviations from the naturally occurring
molecules.
Of the three types, phytocannabinoids have garnered a lot of interest because of their
therapeutic and recreational potential. For example, Marinol and Syndros, which the
FDA cleared for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients,
include the active ingredient dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) which is considered the psychoactive component of marijuana. In June 2018, the
FDA approved an oral formulation of cannabidiol (CBD), Epidiolex, which GW
Pharmaceuticals PLC developed for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare
and severe forms of epilepsy in children.
In addition to THC and CBD, more than 100 other phytocannabinoids have been
identified from the cannabis plant. This includes lesser-known compounds such as
tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabichromene (CBC).
The broad spectrum of phytocannabinoids can bind to a range of different receptors in
the human body and induce a wide variety of pharmacological responses. However, due
to the limited research into these varying effects, a full understanding of the role of each
cannabinoid compound is still poorly understood. With that said, some of the most
studied roles are listed in the table below.

Need For Alternative Methods To Produce Cannabinoids
Cannabis plants can exhibit wide variation in the quantity and type of cannabinoids they
produce. However, cannabinoids are only produced in limited quantities regardless of
the strain; in total, cannabinoids account for <1% of the dry weight of the cannabis
plant.
Selective breeding has led to strains of the cannabis plant that produce relatively large
amounts of the intermediary forms of THC and CBD. While THC content varies
substantially among cannabis strains, it generally represents 15-35% of the cannabinoid
content of the plant, and CBD is typically 1-12%. The relative abundance of these
compounds have allowed them to be well studied and their diversity of applications
have created a large commercial market.
After THC and CBD, the remaining cannabinoids are found only in trace amounts in the
plant. Compounds such as THCV, CBG, and CBC have elicited therapeutic interest, but
because they are only present in minute amounts they have been difficult to extract and
purify and impossible to produce at commercial scale. This has limited their study up to
this point.
Alternative Methods For Producing Cannabinoids
To combat the limited availability of cannabinoids using cultivation-based methods,
alternative approaches have been developed that use chemical and biotechnological
synthesis to produce cannabinoids.
Chemical Synthesis
Chemical synthesis methods use organic chemistry to produce cannabinoids; however,
the process has several drawbacks. Chemical methods have largely failed to be cost
effective for commercial scale cannabinoid production because of the complexity
required to produce the cannabinoid molecules, and extensive purification is needed to
obtain a high quality product. Commercial chemical synthesis also generates large
amounts of organic waste, takes several weeks to produce kilogram quantities, and is
expensive. As such, practical methods for the chemical synthesis of many cannabinoid
molecules has not been developed.
Biotechnological Synthesis (Synthetic Biology)
This report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.
An emerging alternative to traditional cultivation and chemical synthesis is the use of
biotechnology-based approaches to produce cannabinoids. These synthetic biology
approaches produce cannabinoids through modifying the metabolism of genetically
engineered organisms. This converts the organism into a biological factory, producing
the desired cannabinoid in large quantities.
Compared to chemical methods, biosynthesis methods are more cost effective, scalable,
and environmentally friendly.
Compared to traditional methods, biosynthesis of cannabinoids is potentially more
sustainable, more reliable, faster, and less expensive. Biosynthesis does not require as
much water or energy input, is not subject to weather or other exogenous factors, takes
~3-5 days to yield an end product vs. traditional methods taking up to 4 months, and is
theoretically less expensive. Additionally, growing cannabis often involves using several
hard-to-remove impurities (e.g., pesticides), that could potentially create significant
safety issues and other undesirable dynamics. Furthermore, purity and regulatory

controls can be implemented when producing compounds with a biosynthesis method

Tampa-based Teewinot combines its biosynthetic processes with sophisticated chemical synthesis to produce proprietary
cannabinoid analogs and prodrugs at commercial scale.
Amyris is an industrial biotechnology company that has used sugarcane fermentation to create hydrocarbon molecules
and produces an array of specialty ingredients and consumer products.
Producing Cannabinoids Using Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology methods use fermentation to produce cannabinoids with identical
chemical structures to those found in plants.
Biocatalytic Cannabinoid Pathways
The first step of the synthetic cannabinoid production requires identification and
extraction of the desired cannabinoid biosynthetic pathways from a cannabis varietal.
The biosynthesis of cannabinoid molecules in a microbe could require four or more
cannabinoid metabolic pathways. When the pathways are selected, their corresponding
DNA sequences need to be cloned from the cannabis varietal and spliced into the
microbial DNA.

Cannabinoids could be produced biocatalytically using the following mechanism:
i. In the first pathway, glucose is converted into G3P and pyruvate via glycolysis.
These two compounds are then utilized to produce the precursors geranyl
pyrophosphate (GPP), and/or neryl pyrophosphate (NPP).
ii. Glycolysis of glucose also produces Acetyl CoA, which can catalyze biosynthesis
of the second group of precursors: olivetolic acid (OA) and divarinic acid (DVA).
COWEN.COM 19
COWEN
COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019
iii. Various combinations of the aforementioned precursors then combine in the
third pathway to yield parent cannabinoid molecules (e.g., cannabigerolic acid
or CBGA).
iv. These parent cannabinoids are then modified in the fourth pathway to produce
cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid
(CBDA). These acids can be transformed into a non-acid form using synthases,
producing the terminal cannabinoid form.
Figure 11 Biosynthetic Cannabinoid Production Pathways
Source: Cowen and Company
Cannabinoid Production Using Fermentation
To power the aforementioned pathways, water and glucose (or a cannabinoid substrate)
are added to the microbe (e.g., yeast) in a bioreactor. Under fermentation, the yeast will
consume the glucose and produce the desired cannabinoid.
This culture is incubated for ~3-5 days to produce sufficient cannabinoid intermediaries.
Afterwards, the fermentation mixture is separated and combined with a non-toxic
solvent to extract and purify the cannabinoids.
Recent Cannabinoid Partnerships In Synthetic Biology
This report is intended for michael.cella@cowen.com. Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited.
With the recent legalization of cannabis in several countries and U.S. states and growing
acceptance of its utility, many recent notable partnerships have been created on the
potential of synthetic cannabinoid production. We highlight two such agreements from
the past few months below.
Amyris / Undisclosed Partner (February 2019; Valued Up to $255MM)
In February 2019, Amyris announced that it has signed an agreement for cannabinoid
development, licensing, and commercialization in a partnership valued at up to $255MM
(not including royalties for commercial products) with an undisclosed partner. The
$255MM in payments include an upfront payment and the remainder is linked to
milestones that are expected over the next 12-36 months. The partner is expected to
provide initial, lab-based and later commercial-scale milestone cash payments in
tranches for the development and scaling of technology to produce CBD.

Cronos Group / Ginkgo Bioworks (September 2018; Valued Up to $122MM)
Cronos Group is a vertically integrated Canadian cannabis company that operates two
licensed producers. In addition, the company has developed an assortment of cannabis
varietals and has amassed an extensive database on various cannabinoids and their
properties. Boston-based Ginkgo Bioworks is a synthetic biology company that has
developed a cutting edge, automated platform for biological engineering and
fermentation. Using synthetic DNA to modify yeast and other organisms, the company
endeavors to produce large amounts of various rare strains through this more efficient,
lower-cost, novel process. Indeed, as we asserted in the MO/CRON note (link), we
believe that this strategic partnership was integral in informing the entry of the largest
tobacco player in the U.S., into the legal global cannabis market.
By way of background, in September 2018, Cronos and Ginkgo announced an
agreement to produce cultured cannabinoids. Ginkgo is tasked with developing strains
of yeast that can produce eight target cannabinoids. Cronos would then handle large
scale production and distribution of those cultured cannabinoids. The total agreement is
valued at $122MM; this includes $22MM to fund R&D, and up to $100MM of CRON
common shares in tranches in accordance with production milestones. More specifically,
the tranches will be issued once each of the target cannabinoids can be produced for
less than $1,000/kg of pure cannabinoids at a scale of >200 liters as follows: THC (20%),
CBD (15%), THCV (15%), CBC (10%), CBG (10%), CBGV (10%), CBDV (10%), and CBCV
(10%). Cronos and Ginkgo expect to reach the milestone for these eight strains within
three years.

Life Science Tools Participation In The Legal Cannabis Market (Schenkel)
Life science tools companies currently participate in the cannabis market primarily
through providing instruments and equipment that: (1) extract active cannabis
ingredients from leaves and seeds and (2) analyze cannabis products for potency and
contaminants. According to one of our consultants who runs a cannabis testing
laboratory, separations instrumentation including liquid chromatography (LC) and gas
chromatography (GC), and mass spectrometry (primarily single quadrupoles, triple
quadrupoles, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers) are the primary
technologies used in cannabis testing. We note that the cannabis testing opportunity is
not limited to LC, GC, and mass spec technologies – other technologies including genetic
analysis tools (DNA sequencers, microarrays, and PCR) could have a greater role in the
cannabis industry in the future.
Cannabis Testing Details
There are three major categories of tests used to measure and monitor the quality of
recreational and medicinal cannabis products: potency testing, terpene profiling, and
contaminant testing. Contaminant testing typically includes testing for the following: (1)
pesticides; (2) residual solvents; (3) heavy metals; (4) moisture content; (5) mycotoxins;
and (6) microorganisms.
For the most part, standards and regulations for cannabis potency and contaminants
testing are still in the infancy stage and vary widely by state – accordingly, testing of
cannabis products vary greatly by locality. The aforementioned tests (also in Figure 13)
are the most commonly performed tests. These tests are primarily performed using
separations instruments and mass spectrometry (see pages 22-23 for details on these
instruments and a list of vendors). Figure 13 lists commonly used instruments
associated with a specific cannabis test.

Liquid Chromatography And Gas Chromatography – How Does It Work?
LC instrumentation is generally composed of: (1) solvent delivery system, (2) sample
injector, (3) separation column, (4) detector, and (5) data acquisition unit. The solvent
delivery unit pumps the solvent through the LC system while the sample injector
introduces the sample into the solvent flow (known as the mobile phase). The
chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by
the detector, which measures the presence and amount of constituents. The data
acquisition unit then records and stores the information from the detector. The
underlying principles of GC are similar to those of LC, with the key difference being that
the mobile phase is a gas instead of a liquid.
LC Is Often Combined With Mass Spec
To obtain the mass spectrum of a single compound in a mixture, the individual
components must be separated prior to MS analysis. Separation is necessary for
unambiguous identification because multiple compounds present simultaneously create
an overlapping or mixed spectrum. The most common separation techniques used in
combination with MS are gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC). LC
and MS from different vendors can be combined. LC is more commonly used as high
temperatures required for GC make it incompatible with the compounds under analysis -
this is a key reason why some cannabis testing labs prefer testing THC using liquid
chromatography (to be clear, analysis using gas chromatography requires heating THC
which changes its properties).

Consumer Products Opportunities (Azer)
In 2018, the CBD market in the U.S. has been estimated to have generated revenues
ranging from ~$600 mm to as much as $2 bn. In our 2019 global cannabis outlook
report (here), we had believed the CBD purchases in the U.S. likely skewed to the lowerend
of that range. However, with new survey data from Cowen’s proprietary consumer
survey, we can see that among our ~2,500 respondents (18+) in January 2019 nearly 7%
reported using CBD as a supplement. Coupled with the diverse form factors reportedly
being used (including close to 20% for beverages, which was surprising to us), we are
now inclined to size the current market at closer to $2 bn.
Indeed, looking at Google search trends, we can see that interest looks to have climbed
steadily in 2016 and 2017, and accelerated meaningfully in 2018, which has continued
into 2019.

U.S. Google Trends: CBD
Encouragingly, interest has been rising consistently among different form factors,
ranging from supplements like CBD gummies, to topicals and oils. The rising interest and
popularity in this broad range of CBD offerings should support a diverse category and
multiple competitors that cater to a large base of consumers with different needs,
requiring various applications.

To further reinforce how CBD has been gaining interest over time, we analyzed the
historical number of hemp oil products offered by Amazon (AMZN, John Blackledge),
where we can see a continued increase in the number of products sold. Indeed, six years
ago, Amazon had been offering roughly 5,000 products, which has quadrupled to over
20,000 products today.

With reported CBD use skewing toward younger consumers, it is perhaps not surprising
to see that CBD also over-indexes to lower-income consumers (where younger
consumers generally have lower household incomes). What is more, CBD seems to be
the most popular among Caucasians, following by Hispanic / Latino consumers.
Meanwhile, CBD use is slightly more popular among women (7.0% incidence), vs. men
(6.7% incidence).

Given increasing interest, younger consumer demographic trends, and a lack of paid
advertising within the space, below we offer a snapshot of the Instagram landscape as a
proxy for current company social media activity. We would caveat that this is not an
exhaustive list, nor does the below chart factor in the impact of influencer marketing,
which is a popular trend in order for these companies to drive brand momentum. That
said, we believe the below chart reflects the competitive nature of the category as we
are already starting to see momentum from less known, emerging brands.
Of the companies analyzed, the below chart reflects the top 17 brands by absolute
Instagram followers, while also providing data on the absolute number of posts over the
month of January, as well as the average number of likes per post.
Absolute Followers. As it currently stands, three companies have an Instagram
following of over 100K people, with CBDFX leading the pack at 181K. Kush Queen and
GT’s Kombucha also look to be well positioned with 168K and 145K followers,
respectively.
# of Posts. Blue Ridge Hemp was the most active over the month of January with 84
posts, followed closely by Hemp Bombs (79 posts) and Pure Hemp Shop (57 posts).
Across the competitive set, the average number of posts for the month of January was
32.
Avg Likes Per Post. In addition to having one of the largest number of absolute
followers, GT’s Kombucha also led the way in average likes per post (1,863). This was
followed by super premium CBD company, Lord Jones, with 1,318 average likes per
post. Not Pot rounded out the top three with 1,257 average likes per post.
We would note that while we consider the below analysis useful in terms of analyzing
social media activity, it should not be used as a proxy for market leadership. Publicly
traded companies such as Charlotte’s Web, CV Sciences and Elixinol have established
themselves as market leaders within CBD, based on distribution / market penetration,
consumer awareness, and brand equity.

From a consumer staples perspective, we see innovation across a host of form factors.
To analyze the category’s potential, we focused on six specific consumer product
categories, including:
i. Nutraceuticals (tinctures, capsules, sprays, and gummy vitamins)
ii. Topicals (for targeted pain relief, like Tiger Balm)
iii. Beverages (water, energy drinks and beer)
iv. Food (including confections and bars)
v. Vapor
vi. Beauty (including skin care, serums, lotions, and bath products)
While our analysis was far from exhaustive, below we:
i. Break down the above product categories by sub-segment to benchmark
pricing, which we define as value, main, premium and super-premium,
ii. Forecast run rate revenues by vertical over the next two years,
iii. Offer company-specific detail on numerous private and public companies as
part of our research on the CBD opportunity (primarily in the U.S.).

Nutraceuticals
Figure 29 Mass Market Makes Up ~17% of Herb Retail Sales
Given robust consumer interest in CBD products, we estimate that over the next two
years, the nutraceuticals category (which includes tinctures, capsules, gummy vitamins,
etc.) can generate revenues of $2.4 bn. Uncertainty around the timing of this revenue
ramp reflects a lack of clarity on how quickly retailers, in particular mass market
retailers, will begin to stock the products following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill.

Our $2.4 bn estimate is benchmarked against the herbal supplement market in the U.S.
According to the American Botanical Council, herbal supplement retail sales were $6.4
bn in 2014, posting the 11 th year of consecutive growth. Between 2004-2014, the
herbal supplement category grew its revenues at a ~4.2% CAGR. Extrapolating that
growth out to 2019 would imply a total herbal supplement market of ~$8 bn over the
next two years. Our $2.4 bn estimate for the CBD market would imply almost a 30%
share of this market by 2020. The importance of retail adoption is reflected in the
category makeup of the herbal supplement market, where we can see that over 17% of
sales come from mass market retailers.

In our consumer survey, of respondents who use CBD, 44% of people use tinctures as a
form factor, which looks to be equally popular among both male and females.
Interestingly, tincture use looks to be the most prevalent form factor among older
consumers, as two-thirds of respondents within this cohort indicated use of a tincture.
Tinctures look to be the most popular form factor across all income demographics, with
over 50% of people using within the $50K-$100K segment.

Along with tinctures, capsules represent one of the more mature form factors within
CBD. Mary’s looks to be squarely positioned as the most premium brand across all
companies analyzed, in particular for their Elite capsule line, which offers 150 mgs of
CBD and retails for $90. For context, the closest price point to Mary’s comes from
Sagely Naturals at $0.17 per mg. Brands look to be very competitively priced in terms of
value, with seven of the brands coming in at $0.10 or below.

males, which shows over a 10 pt delta relative to women. In addition, on a relative basis
to other form factors, CBD capsule use is more popular with younger, lower-income
consumers, which perhaps explains the notable competition seen within the value

For gummies, we analyzed 30 SKUs across 13 brands. Our analysis shows that CV
Sciences’ CBD Oil Gummies are the most premium priced at an average $0.24 per mg of
CBD. CV Sciences offers two SKUs with their 30 capsule bottle providing 150 mgs of
CBD for $39.95, while their second SKU offers a slightly better value proposition, with a
60 count bottle providing 300 mgs of CBD for $64.95 ($0.22 per mg).
Hemp Bombs had the largest number of SKU’s relative to the other brands analyzed (7),
while also having the highest absolute price point ($139.99 for a 60 gummy bottle with
1,500 mgs of CBD), though the average price per mg of CBD positioned the brand within
the main segment.
Similar to its tincture offering, we would note that Highline falls broadly in the middle of
its peers, as their direct-to-consumer business model allows the company to offer
competitive pricing across its portfolio.
Almost half of the brands analyzed fell into the value segment, all priced at $0.10 per
mg of CBD or lower. Across all 30 SKUs, average retail price was ~$50 per offering, with
an average 450 mgs of CBD offered per bottle.

Outside of nutraceuticals, we expect the topical CBD market to provide the largest
contribution to industry sales. We believe the non-ingestible nature of the product
makes it more attractive to consumers looking to experiment in CBD and can provide a
source of trial into the category. While the CBD market clearly needs more clinical
research into the benefits of the cannabinoid, it has been suggested that two of the
primary benefits are anti-inflammation and muscle recovery, which can cater to a large
and diverse consumer base.
Over the next two years, we expect the topical CBD market to grow to $1.5 bn (almost
$1 bn less than our outlook for nutraceuticals). We estimate that in 2018, the total
addressable U.S. topical market, which includes both OTC and rx offerings was ~$12.8
bn. If we assume no growth in the category base, a $1.5 bn CBD category by 2020
would imply a ~12% share of the market, the largest market share among all of the
categories analyzed, excluding nutraceuticals.

Our below scenario analysis provides a wider incremental range of market share
outcomes relative to other categories. We can see that every 5 pts of market share
capture is worth over $600 mm in revenues. While our analysis contemplates a 2% share
of the topical market, we believe that this is unlikely and view the floor at ~7%, which
would imply almost $900 mm in revenues by 2020. Given the number of companies
providing topical solutions, coupled with what we expect to be robust consumer
demand, a market share between 12-17% is not unrealistic.

Benchmarking across the topical market, we would highlight the absolute number of
brands offering a product, which while not exhaustive, provides context on the
popularity of the form factor. Similar to most other verticals, Mary’s topicals fall into the
super-premium segment, which we define as anything above $0.54 per mg of CBD. Of all
the SKUs analyzed, the premium segment looks to be the narrowest, while mainstream
and value segments are the most popular price point among the competitive set.

( < $0.21)
According to our proprietary Cowen consumer survey, of respondents who use CBD,
26.2% of people use topicals as a form factor, which is the highest level seen after
tinctures. Usage among men and women look to be similar, though younger, lower
income use looks to be more prevalent when benchmarking to older, higher income
cohorts. Similar to capsules, this could reflect the large number of brands we see playing
in the value segment.

Beverages
Over the next two years, we believe that the beverage category can grow to a $900 mm
revenue opportunity. Our conviction in this category is underscored by our proprietary
consumer survey, which shows that almost 20% of CBD users consume beverages,
which we view as an encouraging sign. For 2019, we are forecasting a notable
acceleration in growth, with revenues more than doubling to $600 mm. Assuming
growth moderates in 2020 (to 50%), we believe revenues will approach the $1 bn mark.

Below we provide a sub-segment build by category, where we believe CBD water will
represent the lion’s share of sales at 65%. Energy drinks have been focused on health
and wellness and we believe that CBD-infused energy drinks will represent a niche
segment in a category that continues to see more competition. We expect CBD beer to
have a place in the category, though should admittedly be smaller in scale, given less
interest from a lack of THC.

Consumer interest in CBD continues to gain momentum. For beverages, in particular
water, this is evidenced by analyzing current Google Trends, where interest rose
considerably over the course of 2018 and looks to still be achieving new highs, which is
not surprising, given the recent passage of the U.S. Farm Bill.

Over the next 2 years we believe that the U.S. CBD water category can generate close to
$600 mm in revenues. In Nielsen, U.S. bottled water generated just over $13 bn in 2018.
Assuming Nielsen channels account for 50% coverage of the category implies total
revenues of over $26 bn. Applying the 4.2% CAGR the category has grown over the last
3 years and extrapolating out results in total revenue surpassing $28 bn by 2020. Our
estimates are premised on CBD water achieving a ~1.5% market share in 2019 and a
conservative ~2% market share of the U.S. bottled water category in 2020. We would
note that a ~2% share of the bottled water category compares to a ~3% share for
coconut water. With the amount of consumer interest and potential functional benefits
that come along with CBD, we believe that a modest 2% share of the category is
reasonable, in particular if multiple larger players within the beverage space enter the
category and drive distribution. Above, we provide a scenario analysis on the revenue
opportunity assuming different market share levels.

Energy is another beverage category that we feel is ripe for CBD inclusion, as it
continues to expand towards health and wellness propositions. This has been reflected in
consistent strong growth from MNST’s Ultra line, which offers functional benefits
without the sugar, Muscle Monster, which is high in protein, as well as the emergence of
Bang, which contains BCAA. At their recent Analyst Day, MNST indicated that they will
be launching a new product called Reign, which will offer 5x the amount of BCAA as
Bang. As the lines between core energy drinks and health and wellness offerings
continue to blur, we would expect all of the major players to come to market with
offerings that contain CBD and provide incremental functional benefits (such as muscle
recovery).
We believe that by 2020 it is reasonable for CBD’s share of the energy category to reach
~1%, which we view as conservative as it is below the current market share run rate that
Bang has already been able to achieve. A 1% share would imply revenues of ~$180 mm
for the CBD segment, assuming that the category continues to grow at the same 4.3%
CAGR it has delivered over the past three years. We can see below that implied category
revenues for total energy would grow by over $1 bn over the next two years to ~$17 bn.

Below we provide a scenario analysis on CBD energy revenues associated with market
share gains. We would note that a 0.3% share by 2020 would be at the low-end of our
expectations and result in revenues of ~$50 mm. As a point of reference, recall that
Mutant, which did not perform to expectations and has essentially been de-prioritized by
MNST, has a current market share of ~0.2%.

We believe CBD infused beer can serve as a niche segment in a rapidly evolving beer
category. With core beer under pressure, a continued theme from the key manufacturers
within the space has been a focus on innovation, as well as a move away from alcohol
into low and no-alcohol offerings (ABI is targeting 20% of portfolio to be low / no alcohol
by 2025).
On the innovation front, hard seltzer looks to be resonating with consumers, which we
believe is sticky, as it offers consumers a new product and opportunity to drive
incremental drinking occasions, while checking the box from a health and wellness
standpoint. In 2018, the hard seltzer category achieved a 1% market share of the
combined beer category, which includes, core beer, cider and FMBs. If we assume that
CBD-infused beer is able to capture a modest fifth of that amount of share by 2020 (~20
bps), that could result in a revenue opportunity of over $130 mm. We have been hearing
growing interest in companies looking to combine CBD in alcoholic beer to offer potential
hangover relief.

These estimates are benchmarked to a category that has grown sales at a 1.6% CAGR
over the past three years. If we assume Nielsen provides 50% coverage of the total
category and extrapolate that growth out, total off-premise revenues should approach
$72 bn by 2020. We provide a sensitivity analysis below on the 2020 revenue
opportunity based on different levels of market share capture. We estimate every 5 bps
of share is worth $36 mm.

Based on our survey, of respondents that use CBD, 19.2% use beverages as a form
factor, which is admittedly higher than we would’ve expected given the nascent stage of
the category. Similar to both capsules and topicals, beverage use is a more popular
choice among younger, lower income consumers (by a wider margin relative to other
age cohorts compared to the other categories). This leaves us optimistic on the future
prospects of the category as a waterfall effect can result in an increase in category mix.

The U.S. beauty category, which is inclusive of skin care, cosmetics, haircare, fragrance,
bath & body, salon styling tools, and other toiletries, is a ~$87 bn industry according to
Euromonitor International and IBIS World Inc. Within mass beauty, the prestige segment
grew 6%, accounting for almost $19 bn in revenue in 2018 according to NPD. If we
extrapolate the 6% growth in prestige beauty out through 2020, that would result in
segment revenues surpassing $21 bn over the next two years.

We expect that CBD beauty will become more of a focus for consumers, as large-scale
manufacturers and retailers begin to roll out more products, which will presumably
generate positive mix and result in a step-change in market share capture. As such, we
believe that a ~1% share of the prestige market is achievable in 2019, doubling to 2% in
2020, which would equate to over $400 mm in sales. The below analysis provides a
scenario of revenue outcomes based on share capture, ranging from ~$200 mm to over
$600 mm.
