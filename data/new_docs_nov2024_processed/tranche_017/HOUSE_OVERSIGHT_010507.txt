Even so, Reiter was beginning to wonder if Krischer was
stacking the deck in Epstein's favor—if, thanks to the sway
prosecutors have over grand juries, assembling such a jury
wasn't an excellent way to let Epstein off with the lightest pun-
ishment possible.

Another unusual thing: the way Barry Krischer and the law-
yers working for him ignored Chief Reiter's multiple phone calls
as well as Detective Recarey’s— even though the police had been
hearing from Epstein’s own lawyers.

“(Krischer] and I had an excellent relationship,” Chief Reiter
said in his deposition. “I was the speaker at his swearing-in cere-
mony. And that he wouldn't return my phone calls—I mean, it
was Clear to me by his actions that he could not objectively look

at this case.”

In the incident report he ended up writing, Detective Recarey
remembered a phone call that he received from Guy Fronstin,
one of the lawyers representing Epstein.

It was a message Epstein wanted to send, something central to
the case that demanded explanation. The whole shit show swirling
around him was just a misunderstanding—a misrepresentation—
of Epstein’s actual interests and intentions.

Fronstin says Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages,
Detective Recarey would write.

And: Mr. Epstein had donated over $100,000 to the Ballet of

Florida for massages.

And: The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound for q

him. That is why he has had so many massages.
