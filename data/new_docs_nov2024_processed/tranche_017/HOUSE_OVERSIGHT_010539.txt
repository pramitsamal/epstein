CHAPTER 52

Jeffrey Epstein: June 30, 2008

he Palm Beach County Main Detention Center is on the
west side of Lake Worth Lagoon, which separates West
4 Palm Beach from the island of Palm Beach. Epstein’s
_ home on El Brillo Way is five miles to the east. Mary’s high
' school is several miles to the west.

Its fitting, somehow, that this jail—which is the jail Epstein
ends up in, after turning himself in to the local sheriff—lies in
| between the two points.

a The detention center’s inmates, their families, and their law-
J yers call it the Gun Club, a reference not only to the jail’s address,
on Gun Club Road, but also to its population of hustlers, bur-
a ts, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers. There’s the occa-
sional hooker as well. And, from time to time, Haitian refugees
re lodged there.

There are three thousand inmates in all.
