DEPOSITION OF PAUL G. CASSELL

Saturday, October 17, 2015

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are now on the video
record. Today is Saturday, the 17th day of
October, 2015. The time is 8:32 a.m. We are
here at 425 North Andrews Avenue, Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, for the purpose of taking
the videotaped deposition of Paul G. Cassell.

The case is Bradley J. Edwards and Paul
G. Cassell versus Alan M. Dershowitz.

The court reporter is Terry Tomaselli, and
the videographer is Don Savoy, both from Esquire
Deposition Solutions.

Will counsel please announce their
appearances for the record.

MR. SCAROLA: Jack Scarola on behalf of the
Plaintiffs.

MR. SIMPSON: Richard Simpson of Wiley Rein
on behalf of the Defendant and Counterclaim
Plaintiff, Alan Dershowitz. With me is my
colleague, Nicole Richardson, and Thomas Scott of
Cole, Scott & Kissane, also for Mr. -~ Professor

MR. SCAROLA: Before we begin the deposition,

we were informed for the first time yesterday
morning of the existence of a recording of a
telephone communication between Alan Dershowitz
and a woman identified only as Rebecca.

That information was conveyed to us
subsequent to Professor Dershowitz's sworn
testimony that no recording existed, but now that
we know that the recording existed and that it
was obviously made according to the
representations given to us, prior to the
completion of the responses to our earlier
discovery requests, I would like to know whether
it is the Defendant's position that it is
necessary for us to propound a new discovery
request to get information that clearly should
have been disclosed in response to the earlier
discovery request.

Is that the position that you're taking?

MR. SIMPSON: First, Mr. Scarola, I believe
you have mischaracterized Professor Dershowitz's
testimony. You didn't ask the question whether
he made a recording. Yesterday morning, he
provided that information in response to a
different question.

MR. SCAROLA: His exact testimony was: I

coors § The question is --
oooz0s § MR. SIMPSON: What you're saying does --
ooor0s «7 MR. SCAROLA: -- are you going to produce the
ooozos 8 recording without the necessity of anew request
cooz10 9 to produce, or will it be necessary for us to
o0213 10 file a new request to produce?
oo0215 11 MR. SIMPSON: As Mr. Scott indicated
oxo2z17 12 yesterday, we will respond to you to the
o.o219 13 discovery request. We will confer at a break and
00223 14 respond to that question. I don't want to take
ooo224 15 time on the record debating it. After Mr. Scott
oooz28 16 and I have conferred at a break, we will respond
oooz23 17 further to your question.
ooo230 18 MR. SCAROLA: All right. So that the record
oooz31 19 is clear, it is our position that the recording
ooozas 20 itself, any evidence of any communication between
oooza0 21 Mr. Dershowitz and Rebecca and/or Michael, any
oovzas 22 notes with respect to any such communications,

oo328 10 sorry, I didn't announce my appearance for the
