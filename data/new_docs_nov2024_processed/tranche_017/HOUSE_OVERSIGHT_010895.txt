Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 291-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/21/2015 Page 5 of 20

15. I visited and traveled with Jeffrey Epstein from 1999 through the summer of
2002, and during that time I stayed with him, as his sex slave, at each of his houses (really more
like mansions) in locations including New York City, New York; the area of Santa Fe, New
Mexico; Palm Beach, Florida; an island in the U.S. Virgin Islands; and Paris, France. I had sex
with him often in these places and also with the various people he demanded that I have sex
with. Epstein paid me for many of these sexual encounters. In fact, my only purpose for
Epstein, Maxwell and their friends was to be used for sex.

16. To illustrate my connection to these places, I include four photographs taken of
me in New Mexico (shown below). The first one is a museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico. We
had gone sightseeing for the day. Epstein took this picture of me. I was approximately 17 at the
time, judging from the looks of it. At the end of the day we returned to Epstein’s Zorro Ranch.
The second picture is me on one of Epstein’s horses on the ranch in New Mexico. The following

two are from wintertime in New Mexico.
