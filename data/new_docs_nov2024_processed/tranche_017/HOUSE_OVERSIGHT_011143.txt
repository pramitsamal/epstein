applied to paper rights such as the mortgage rather than to physical or human

capital itself.

Depreciation of those assets is not as simple as with the mortgage. Cash flow F and
discount rate r are typically variables rather than constants. Depreciation theory
avoids that complexity, much as accountants do, by treating each successive

investment in an asset as if it were a separate asset depreciating in itself.

(A2.5) through (A2.10) gave present value at time x of a differential foreseen

positive cash flow at future time z as
dPV(x)= F (zje dz , (A8.1)

where the differential present value arose from a earlier or concurrent negative
cash flow invested at time u<=x .It was shown that all of asset value PV(x) at any
time x can be explained as a sum or integral of such differential increments

evolving with time alone from investment to eventual realization.
Meanwhile all output within the differential increment of dPV is self invested.
Growth dPV can be understood either as this self-invested output or equivalently

the shortening discount period, as each means growth at rate r. At interim moment

dPV’(t)=r(x)dPV(t)=F(z)je dt = EHO RG: , X<=t<z.  (A8.2)

Thus present value rises exponentially as long as the moment of cash flow is

deferred.
