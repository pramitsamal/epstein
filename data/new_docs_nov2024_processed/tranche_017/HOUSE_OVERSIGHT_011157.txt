Figure 2: Constrained Optimization in Evolution
Darwinian fitness increases with increasing values of characters «) and «(2), and the dotted fitness isograms
connect points of equal fitness. The two solid constraint lines illustrate two different hypotheses about
which combinations of «“) and «) are feasible. For any assumed constraint, the evolutionary problem is
to choose the point on the constraint line that maximizes fitness. This constrained optimum occurs where
the constraint line and fitness isogram have equal slope, i.e. where MRSc = MRS.
