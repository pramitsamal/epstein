THE COURT: I didn't say redaction. It's hearsay,

it's not being offered, but of course it is being offered for

the truth ef the matter.

MR. PAGLIUCA: Exactly. You know, this is a

smokescreen about it goes to Maxwell's state of mind. And when

you carefully go through these police reports, there is not one

of these alleged victims who identifies Ms. Maxwell as having
anything to do with any of this. Which is another important
point.

What I find curious, again, Ms. McCawley usually says

there are 30 victims identified in these police reports, which

isn't true. And when I asked Detective Recarey to go through

them with me and identify how many people he said were victims,

there were 17. And so now today she said there were 20. So
she's working her way my way. But, you know, that's the
problem here, your Honor. This is being offered for the truth

of the matter asserted. All they want to do is get in front of

a jury that there was a police department investigation in

which Epstein was the target and Epstein is alleged to have

done all of these bad things; therefore, you should punish

Maxwell because then they're going to say, she was his
girlfriend, she had to have known, yada, yada, yada, yada, he's
a bad person, she's a bad person, find her liable, and whack

her with a big damage award. That's what's going on here.

Thank you.
