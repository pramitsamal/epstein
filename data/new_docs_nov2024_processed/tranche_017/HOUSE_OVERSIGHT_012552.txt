Q Did she tell you anything about whether you
were a victim in this case, or anything like that, at
that meeting?

A Yes, she said I was a victim/witness in this,

and that there’s victim rights that I'm entitled to,

which include counseling and whatnot.

Q Did you tell her, at that time, that you
didn't feel that you were a victim at all, and that
anything that you've done with Jeffrey Epstein was
totally voluntary?

A Yeah, I did tell her that everything was, you
know, consensual with everything, and I don't agree
with anything that's going on.

Q Did she try and pressure you into being a
victim in this thing, when you were not a victim?

A I wouldn't say that she pressured me, but
tried to be as convincing as possible.

Q Maybe the use of the word pressure is too
strong. But she was trying to change your opinion of
what the relationship was with Jeffrey?

A Yes, she was trying to make me feel bad about
it, in a way, about what was going on.

Q And you didn't feel bad about it, you felt
everything was okay, but she was trying to make you

feel bad, like something wrong had occurred?
