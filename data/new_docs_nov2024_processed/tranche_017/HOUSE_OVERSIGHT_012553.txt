, Yeah.
How long did that meeting go on for?
Probably about -- at least an hour.

Q When was the next time that you had contact
with Nesbith or someone else from law enforcement?

A I'm not sure, probably a month or later. I
mean, she probably called me and let me know that she
was going to -- you know, she wanted to meet sometime
soon, to deliver the victim's rights papers to me.

Q So there was a time, after you first met,

where, despite the fact that you said, I don't consider

myself a victim in this, she called you and said, I

want to bring you some paperwork that talks about your
victim's rights?

A Yes,

0) What was your response to her when she told
you that?

A I told her I would meet with her, 'cause she
wanted me to meet with the other woman involved. And
they gave them to me.

I took them, but I never really told them I
needed counseling or anything like that.

Q Where did that meeting take place?

A I believe it was Panera Bread in

Wellington.
