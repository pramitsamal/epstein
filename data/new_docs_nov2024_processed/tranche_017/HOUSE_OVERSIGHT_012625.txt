Hi Jay — Can you give mea call at RE his morning? | am meeting with the agents
and want to give them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.

Also, please remove Babbitt and Searcy from the list. There is too great a chance of an
appearance of impropriety with Babbitt and I received a bad report about Searcy last night.

Thank you.

Subject: Other attorneys

Hi Jay — These four people were recommended. I have not contacted them to find out what their
rates are. All are very active in the plaintiffs’ bar in the West Palm area. Ted Babbitt would be

my first choice of these four but I think he is conflicted out because one of his partners is
married to an AUSA here. Stuart Grossman is probably my second choice.
