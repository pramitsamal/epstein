Hi Jay — J already told Bert that there is no indictment and, as 1 mentioned, he doesn’t really
need to/want to see the entire plea agreement, just the relevant paragraphs so that he understands
what the scope of his representation will be. I think they would be happy knowing that their
hourly rate will be paid when it is billed. The concern is, if all 40 girls decide they want to sue,
they don’t want to be in a situation where Mr. Epstein says this is getting too expensive, we won’
t pay any more attorneys’ fees.

‘wo suggestions, that I] haven't run past Bert, are:

i. Mr. Epstein signs a standard fee agreement, where one of his attorneys or
accountants whe is not working on the damages litigation receives a monthly bill with
attorney's fees charged at an hourly rate and cosis billed monthly. The bills will have
any privileged information redacted. If there is a dispute about a bill that cannot be
resolved, it will be submitted to a mediator for resolution.

2. If that is too open-ended for Mr. Epstein, do the hourly/monthily billing until Bert
has had a chance to confer with all of the girls to determine how many want him to
represent them. Once it is known how many girls will be represented by Bert, and mayhe
who those girls are, there can be a more educated discussion about estimated fees and
costs.

Just some food for thought. I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be reachable by cell
phone. I will make sure Bert is available and confirm the time with you.
