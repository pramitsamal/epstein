Acknowledgements

I wrote this book while my cat, Humphrey Bogart, sat on my desk, staring at the computer monitor.
Though he purred a lot, and was good value when I needed a break, he didn’t provide a single insight.
Nor did our other pets: a dog, rabbit, and two other cats. For insights, critical comments on my writing,
comfort, and endless love and inspiration, there is only one mammal, deliciously wonderful, and without
an evil bone in her body — my wife, Lilan.

Mare Aidinoff ... a Harvard undergraduate who joined me early on in this journey, digging up
references, collecting data, arguing interpretations, sharing my enthusiasm, while offering his own.

Kim Beeman and Fritz Tsao ... my two oldest and closest friends. They have some of the richest
minds around. Their knowledge of film, literature and the arts is unsurpassed. Their capacity to bring
these riches to the sciences is a gift.

Noam Chomsky... for inspiration, fearless attacks on power mongering, and friendship.

Errol Morris... for heated discussion, camaraderie, and insights into evil through his
cinematographic lens and critical mind.

Many colleagues, students, and friends provided invaluable feedback on various parts of the
book, or its entirety: Kim Beeman, Kent Berridge, George Cadwalader, Donal Cahill, Noam Chomsky,
Jim Churchill, Randy Cohen, Daniel Dennett, Jonathan Figdor, Nick Haslam, Omar Sultan Haque, Lilan
Hauser, Bryce Huebner, Ann Jon, Gordon Kraft-Todd, Errol Morris, Philip Pettit, Steven Pinker, Lisa
Pytka, Richard Sosis, Fritz Tsao, Jack Van Honk, and Richard Wrangham.

My agent, John Brockman...not only a great agent but a wonderful human being who supported
me during challenging times.

My editors at Viking/Penguin, Wendy Wolff and Kevin Doughten. Tough when needed.
Supportive when needed. A unique blend. The book is all the better for it.
