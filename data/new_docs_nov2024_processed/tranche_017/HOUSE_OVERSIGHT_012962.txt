Fig. 3.2: The General Process of Analysis

Conceptually one may view synthesis as a very generic sort of “growth process,” and analysis
as a very generic sort of “figuring out how to grow something.” The intuitive idea underlying
the present proposal is that these forward-going and backward-going “growth processes” are
among the essential foundations of cognitive control, and that a conceptually sound design for
cognitive control should explicitly make use of this fact. To abstract away from the details,
what these processes are about is:

e taking the general dynamic of compound-formation and reduction as outlined in Kampis
and Chaotic Logic

e introducing goal-directed pruning (“filtering”) into this dynamic so as to account for the
limitations of computational resources that are a necessary part of pragmatic intelligence

3.4.3 The Dynamic of Iterative Analysis and Synthesis

While synthesis and analysis are both very useful on their own, they achieve their greatest power
when harnessed together. It is my hypothesis that the dynamic pattern of alternating synthesis
and analysis has a fundamental role in cognition. Put simply, synthesis creates new mental
forms by combining existing ones. Then, analysis seeks simple explanations for the forms in the
mind, including the newly created ones; and, this explanation itself then comprises additional
new forms in the mind, to be used as fodder for the next round of synthesis. Or, to put it yet
more simply:
