Fig. 8.2: High-level overview of the key cognitive dynamics considered here in the context of
cognitive synergy. The cognitive synergy principle describes the behavior of a system as it
pursues a set of goals (which in most cases may be assumed to be supplied to the system
“a priori’, but then refined by inference and other processes). The assumed intelligent agent
model is roughly as follows: At each time the system chooses a set of procedures to execute,
based on its judgments regarding which procedures will best help it achieve its goals in the
current context. These procedures may involve external actions (e.g. involving conversation,
or controlling an agent in a simulated world) and/or internal cognitive actions. In order to
make these judgments it must effectively manage declarative, procedural, episodic, sensory
and attentional memory, each of which is associated with specific algorithms and structures
as depicted in the diagram. There are also global processes spanning all the forms of memory,
including the allocation of attention to different memory items and cognitive processes, and the
identification and reification of system-wide activity patterns (the latter referred to as “map

formation”)
