2. Scientific experimentation and other rigorous observational testing of abstract formaliza-
tions.

3. Social and philosophical modeling, and other advanced applications of empathy and the
Theory of Mind.

In terms of inference control this stage sees not just perception of new knowledge about
inference control itself, but inference controlled reasoning about that knowledge and the creation
of abstract formalizations about inference control which are reasoned-upon, tested, and verified
or debunked.

11.4.3.1 Systematic Experimentation

The Piagetan formal phase is a particularly subtle one from the perspective of uncertain in-
ference. In a sense, AGI inference engines already have strong capability for formal reasoning
built in. Ironically, however, no existing inference engine is capable of deploying its reasoning
rules in a powerfully effective way, and this is because of the lack of inference control heuris-
tics adequate for controlling abstract formal reasoning. These heuristics are what arise during
Piaget’s formal stage, and we propose that in the content of uncertain inference systems, they
involve the application of inference itself to the problem of refining inference control.
