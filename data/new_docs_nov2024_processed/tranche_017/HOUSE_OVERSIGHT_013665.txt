common practice of Rumi’s Mevlevi (and other) orders of Islamic Dervishes that
facilitate the onset and maintenance of their ecstatic states by an improvisational
dance which goes from rocking to irregular whirling. The Dervish teaching tales
place a symbolic emphasis on the power of the rotating wheel, the circling of the
heavenly bodies, the mill wheel and the millstone. As Rumi said, “The mountain of
the sun I'll fashion to a mill. And as my waters run, I'll turn thee at my will.” Note that
their work toward spiritual transformation results in neither the emergence of the
involuntary and rigid limit cycles of invariant circles or the associated divisive
internal eigensplitting of good self from evil other. The Sufi compass points to an
integrated field of divine consciousness, which contains the appearance of the
world’s multiplicity. In this profound unity, all humankind is perceived as one family.
The singular direction of all prayer, Salat, five times a day, at dawn, high noon,
afternoon, sunset and an hour after sunset, turns the entire world into a unified
directional field of prayer. At its center, the Islamic pilgrims wander round and round
the black cube of the ancient shrine of Kaaba,

This leaves one with the speculation that we started with: that the simple,
authoritarian rules of the amphetamine, roll-up and splitting religions may be
intrinsically more vulnerable to unpredictable breakouts into morally inconsistent
actions and that the righteously rigid limit cyclists are invariantly split into
ambivalence. In contrast, the more free form, chaotic turns of the entheogenic

dervish define us all as belonging to one unified ecstatic field.
