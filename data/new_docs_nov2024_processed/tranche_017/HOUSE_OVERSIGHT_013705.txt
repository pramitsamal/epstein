Although counter-intuitive when expressed in words, the trajectories that one
sees in the graphics of chaotic attractors result from the actions along the “unstable”
directions of the stretching distortion; the actions in the otherwise invisible stable
directions “iron down” the points onto this unstable manifold (n dimensional abstract
surface).

As might be expected from this set of characteristic motions, the diagnostic
triad of chaotic dynamical systems are: (1) Sensitivity to initial conditions—tiny
distances between starting points are magnified and large distances between
starting points are reduced under the stretching and folding actions of the system;
(2) The presence of a theoretically infinite but countable number of unstable
periodic orbits of theoretically all period lengths—points in phase space can be
viewed an attractive-repellers, visited and left by the orbits recursively as the
dynamics proceed; and (3) Indecomposability—the attractor is not separable into
isolated regions and no points escape (see Devaney, 1989, for one of the clearest
definitions). Of particular relevance to information encoding and transport by brain
mechanisms, it is important to visualize that new information in the form of unstable
periodic orbits is being created as well as destroyed by the dynamics. The
logarithmic rate of formation of these new orbits is computed as the system’s

topological entropy (see below).

Assuming the real neurobiological system under study is behaving in these
ways (and often much has to be done to help justify such a claim), the observables
take the form of an irregular and/or episodic time series of amplitudes, as in
repeated sample, neuroendocrine studies of plasma hormone levels (Veldhuis and
Johnson, 1992) or a sequence of times between events as in neuronal interspike
intervals (Katz, 1966; Perkel et al, 1967). These time or time-sequence series are
generally studied from three relatively distinct yet complementary quantitative
perspectives: (1) As stochastic (“random”) processes with various amounts of
sequential dependency (autocorrelations) and scale (sample length) dependencies;
(2) As “deterministic” smooth or discrete, vectorial geometries in phase space
following reconstruction and/or embedding of the series as phase portraits or return

maps; (3) As information generating and transporting, topological (about relative
