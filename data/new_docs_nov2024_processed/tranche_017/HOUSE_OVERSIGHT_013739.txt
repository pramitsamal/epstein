decrease in entropy in brain-relevant dynamical systems. As we shall see, certain
pathophysiological processes appear to manifest themselves as reductions in
background or “resting” state entropy which then limits its supply with respect to
information gain and/or transport. Relationships between “physical” thermodynamic
observables, such as changes in heat capacity or temperature dependence of
kinetic constants, and information-transport driven, neurotransmitter evoked
conformational changes in neural membrane proteins may someday come together
in an experimentally productive way (Hitzemann et al, 1985; Zeman et al, 1987;

Borea et al, 1988), but they are beyond the scope of this paper.

The idea of taming the orbit of an expanding flow (with at least one 2(+) ) by

partitioning the geometric space supporting its actions, its “manifold,” and then
labeling each box so that its trajectory is representable by a symbol string of box
indices is the way “symbolic dynamics” are applied to dynamical systems. Symbolic
dynamics arose in pure mathematics in the context of obtaining a one-to-one,
topological (sequence not distance preserving ) representation of a difficult to
characterize system of “geodesics on surfaces of negative curvature” (Hadamard,
1898; Morse, 1917; Morse and Hedlund, 1938). Geodesics here are the shortest
lines in this curved, non-Euclidean space in which nearby lines spread apart and far

away ones came together with (in Euclidian space) parallel lines meeting at infinity.

Remarkably, symbolic dynamic encoding of the motions on this abstract
manifold of negative curvature also capture how uniformly divergent (and
convergent), “hyperbolic” chaotic systems, such as brain systems, behave in
Euclidean space, an intuitive similarity about which Poincare experienced his
famous vacation bus trip epiphany (Stillwell, 1985). It should also be noted that
encoding neural spike trains in one dimension for symbolic dynamical comparisons
of sequence structure and recurrances, “favored patterns” has been developed
independently of orbital dynamics on manifolds (Dayhoff, 1984; Dayhoff and
Gerstein, 1983a; 1983b). A similar approach has been used to characterize firing
patterns and their response to acupuncture in dopamine neurons in the substantia

nigra and hypothalamic neurons (Chen and Ku, 1992).
