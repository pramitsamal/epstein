Full-Service Infomercial Producers

These are the companies that made Oreck Direct, Nutrisystem, Nordic-Track, and Hooked on Phonics
household names. The first has an excellent DRTV glossary and both sites offer excellent resources.
Don’t call unless you can budget at least $15,000 for a short-form commercial or $50,000+ for a long-
form infomercial.
