2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 77

Passed in 1990, the VRRA provided crime victims with a set of procedural
rights similar to those found in the CVRA, along with rights to notification
about victim services.” In 2004, the CVRA repealed and replaced the
section of the VRRA listing procedural rights, while leaving other parts of
the VRRA intact.°? Under the remaining parts of the VRRA, the Justice
Department must inform victims of federal crimes of services that are
available to them, including “emergency medical and social services,”
counseling, and support.”’ The Department is further obligated to keep
victims fully informed about “the status of the investigation of the crime, to
the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and to the extent that it will
not interfere with the investigation.’ These rights to notice about
“emergency medical and social services”? as well as to the “status of the
investigation of the crime” obviously require the Department to identify
victims of federal crimes before formal charges have been filed. Indeed, the
VRRA makes this point clear by directing the Department to not only notify
the victim about the status of the investigation but also about the later
“filing of charges against a suspected offender.”°’ The VRRA then extends
victims’ rights to information through the rest of the criminal justice
process by requiring the Department to provide notice to victims of such
things as the imposed sentence and the defendant’s release.*°

The VRRA not only requires the Department to identify victims during
the investigation of a crime, it also defines those victims in a very similar
fashion to the CVRA. The VRRA defines “victim” as a “person that has
suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the
commission of a crime.””’’ Thus, the Department is already routinely
identifying persons who have been “harmed” by federal crimes shortly after
the commission of those crimes and well before formal charging.

The Attorney General has also promulgated internal guidelines
requiring Justice Department components to identify victims rapidly after a
crime. The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance
provide that “Department responsibilities to crime victims begin as soon as
possible after the detection of a crime at which they may be undertaken
