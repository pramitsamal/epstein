contained in a police file in a civil proceeding, even though it appears that
there was little indication that criminal charges had been filed.”*8 Similarly,
the South Carolina Supreme Court, while limiting the ability of the victim
to challenge the conduct of a prosecutor, concluded that the same rights
under the state constitution must attach prior to the formal filing of an
indictment.” Other courts have even permitted a victim to recover
compensation or reparations for unindicted or acquitted conduct.**°

In other words, while few state judiciaries have addressed the precise
timing of state crime victims’ rights, those that have addressed the question
have typically found that the rights do extend to pre-charging situations.

Despite the relative dearth of state court cases, it is worth noting that
most state statutes unequivocally provide for notification rights early in the
criminal process.”! For example, the Illinois statute imposes a limited duty
on law enforcement agencies to keep victims informed of the status of an
investigation until the accused is apprehended or the agency discontinues
the investigation.’ Similarly, law enforcement agencies in Iowa must
keep the victim apprised of the investigation “until the alleged assailant is
apprehended or the investigation is closed.””°? Michigan’s statute requires
law enforcement to provide information within a mere twenty-four hours of
contact between the agency and the victim.”

In sum, while state law on crime victims’ rights before charging is not
fully developed, what law exists tends to support the position that crime
victims deserve rights before the formal filing of charges. This law fits the
long-standing trend in states toward expanding protections for crime

particularly ambiguous, because the notification requirement imposed upon the prosecuting
attorney contains a time limitation (after arraignment), but the legislature did not include an
express time limitation on the conferral right. See Micu. Comp. Laws ANN. § 780.756(3)
(West 2007) (requiring the victim have the opportunity to consult prior to “any negotiation
that may result in a dismissal, plea or sentence bargain, or pretrial diversion”); see also Miss.
