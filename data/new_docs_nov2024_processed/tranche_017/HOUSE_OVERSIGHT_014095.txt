Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Production of Documents

any and all ‘absolute proof’ as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn declaration of Alan M.
Dershowitz.”

On February 11, 2015, counsel for Edwards and Cassell sent an email to counsel for
Dershowitz, noting that discovery production was past due and inquiring as to whether a motion
to compel would be necessary. That same day, a paralegal for Cole, Scott & Kissane confirmed
that appropriate production would be made by the end of the week. Shortly after, an attorney for
Dershowitz disavowed that commitment, and indicated that Dershowitz would make his
productions by February 23, 2015.

On February 23, 2015 — 45 days after the discovery requests had been served —
Dershowitz responded. With regard to the request for production of documents, Dershowitz
produced no documents whatsoever. Instead, he made a vague commitment to produce
unspecified documents at some unspecified time in the future. [Illustrative of Dershowitz’s
failure to make any substantive production is the following request for production and
Dershowitz’s answer:

9. Copies of any and all “absolute proof” as described in paragraph 8 of
the sworn Declaration of Alan M. Dershowitz.

RESPONSE: Defendant objects to this Document Request to the extent
that Plaintiffs seek to alter or shift any burdens of proof as a matter of law in this
action. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing specific objections and

General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce all responsive, non-
privileged documents currently in his possession, cuStody or control.

Dershowitz made the same evasive response — “Defendant responds that he will produce”

unspecified “non-privileged documents” — to multiple discovery requests. See Dershowitz
