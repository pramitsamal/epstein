Pricing/fee structure in retail seems to have more of a following

Given some underperformance of active managers, some scrutiny around fees, as well
as fee pressure from passive, we asked investors if they thought a change in active
pricing could make sense, i.e. charge a lower base fee with a variable performance fee
that would be earned when alpha is generated. We found a majority of respondents
thought it would make sense to change the pricing structure and it could make active
more competitive vs passive (67%). The rest of respondents felt it didn’t make sense
either because it would be too challenging for the active industry or it would not slow
the flows into passive.
