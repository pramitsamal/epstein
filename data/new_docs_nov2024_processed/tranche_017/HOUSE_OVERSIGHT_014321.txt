Alternative Asset Manager Takeaways

Within alternative asset management, four of the public managers, ARES, BX, CG, and
KKR presented, while the others did meetings. During the conference we polled the
audience on several key topics including the outlook for the equity and real estate
markets, potential impacts from the recent election, distribution outlook, and firm
structures and business models. Investors were generally bullish on the equity market,
potential for fiscal stimulus ahead, and a key focus from investors was on the potential
change in taxes following the election, and whether that means reassessing corporate
structures for the alts, with a possible change from PTP to C-corp.
