Equities: Add long Nikkei to EM Asia

Global equity markets have gone in very different directions post the US election. EM
have fared worst, Europe little changed, S&P at new all-time highs, the Russell and
Nikkei on a tear higher. This is not how we were positioned so we need to ask the
question of whether and what we need to change.

If we stand back from the noise and just look at the valuations, the US is the most
expensive, MSCI Asia ex the cheapest in absolute terms. Our strategists see decent
earnings growth likely to come through in EM Asia, and while there is upside to US
earnings estimates from potential corporate tax cuts at least part of it is priced in.
Savita Subrahamian has a target for the US of 2300 in her year ahead Euphoria or fiscal
fizzle?, an upside of a less than 5%. Our European strategists have an upside of around
6%. So that leaves EM Asia and Japan (given our 20k target) as the stand outs according
to our equity strategists. Indeed, the PE of Japan is towards the bottom end of the
range since 2000.

Sticking with EM Asia

One of our concerns on EM was a more hawkish Fed and therefore a stronger USD. So
we regarded our positions in those asset classes as something of a hedge to our EM
positions. As we explained above we are keeping that stance as on our central scenario
there is more to go and on a risk scenario where bond markets overshoot the USD is
likely to follow.

In the equity world, if our fixed income and FX forecasts are right, then we do not see
them as being an impediment to our EM Asia position working again. Our EM strategists
remain upbeat and Ajay Kapur actually upgraded his call to buy from a tactical pause
post the election (A Call to Action: Time to BUY Asia/EMs). They think the right focus is
one on growth rather than the USD and we continue to be upbeat on the prospects for
EM growth, particularly in Asia. Ajay in particular makes the point that Chinese nominal
GDP growth has been accelerating and that tends to be very good for Asian equity
markets. Nigel Tupper’s global wave has continued to improve and he argues that
remains consistent with strong performance from Asia ex Japan equities.
