The question then is whether the strong USD or trade tensions from the new Trump
administration can outweigh the more positive macro backdrop. We are inclined to back
the view of our strategists and think that it will, so we are sticking with our long EM

Asia position. We are doing so with hedges via a long USD and a CNH put.

Long Nikkei: target 20,000

We had previously paired our long EM position with a long US oil equity position, but
with our US strategists downgrading the sector ahead of OPEC we removed it earlier
this week. We were therefore looking for another pro-growth trade to run alongside our
EM position. Long Japanese equities seemed the logical place to look. While we
acknowledge we have missed the lows and that today’s entry point may not be ideal, we
suspect investors are not particularly long Japan yet since it was still showing as

modestly underweight in the last Fund Manager Survey.

2016

Our Japanese equity and FX strategist Shusuke Yamada has been arguing for a while
that we would see both a weaker JPY and a rebound in Japanese equities. While arguably
the JPY had turned beforehand, the Trump victory turbo charged the move. As the chart
shows below Japanese equities do well historically during a period of bear steepening of
the US yield curve. Our economists are also more upbeat on Japan thinking the weaker
USD, the new policy stance of the BO) and the fiscal stimulus will push growth and

inflation higher next year.
