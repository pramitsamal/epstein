Volatility: Sticking with Relative trades
While 2016 started off with a bang volatility wise it has ended with a whimper. Neither
Brexit nor the US presidential election proved to be anything more than a blip. Realised
vol in the S&P 500 over the last 100 days is just 9.5%. That compares to 13.6% for the
Eurostoxx 15.1% for the Russell and 21.8% for the NKY.

That is why we prefer relative variance trades. They tend to carry flat to positive but
have convexity to the downside. We are happy to continue to run these trades into 2017
and then use shorter term instruments to hedge specific events.

We did this around Brexit and have recently bought a 3000-2850 Eurostoxx put spread
to hedge our European exposure around the Italian referendum. While a No vote is
expected we are not sure what the aftermath will look like and there is considerable
uncertainty over the bank recapitalization of the banks afterwards.

We also have a calendar put spread in eurostoxx which tends to pay off best around the
2500-2600 levels so that remains something that we will look to keep for now given
downside risks in Europe over the first half of next year.

One trade we are taking off today is our Kospi forward vol position. We had held that as
a hedge against a China hard landing. Our derivative strategists no longer like it and we
have no opted for a currency hedge for our China risk, as discussed above.
