very depressed despite the recent uptick in rigs,
providing scope for further increases (see Exhibit
97). As a result, we expect shale production to
recover in 2017, partially offsetting cuts elsewhere.

Despite these potentially destabilizing forces,
we still think the oil market can swing to a small
deficit this year. While lower input costs create
upside risks to US shale production, these costs are
highly correlated with oil itself. As a result, today’s
$50 average breakeven level for shale is likely to
move higher with oil prices, limiting the rebound
in US production. Moreover, even if just half of
the proposed production cuts are realized, our
work suggests the oil market will still switch into a
deficit this year. Finally, OPEC spare capacity has
been largely exhausted by the production increases
of the last year, while Iran’s production has now
returned to pre-sanction levels. In turn, the risk of
another disorderly market-share battle has declined
significantly.

Against this backdrop, we expect oil supply
growth to moderate and enable oil demand to
again exceed oil production, creating the first
deficit since 2013 (see Exhibit 98). With balance
restored, we expect oil to trade in a $45-65 range
in the year ahead. Thus we continue to recommend
an overweight to US high yield energy bonds
and US MLPs.

Gold: Still Searching for Its Luster

Gold was not immune from the reversal of fortune
that befell interest rates last year, reminding us
that their fates are fundamentally linked (see
Exhibit 99). Put simply, higher interest rates raise
the opportunity cost of holding gold, since the
yellow metal generates no cash flow and must

be physically stored, often at a cost. A similarly
inverse relationship exists with the US dollar, as
investors often purchase gold as a hedge against
the debasement of fiat currencies; gold has traded
inversely to the dollar index 73% of the time on an
annual basis over the last 40 years.

Given these relationships, we believe the key
elements of our macroeconomic forecast—Federal
Reserve tightening, rising interest rates, modest US
dollar gains and average inflation—will represent
headwinds for the yellow metal in 2017. Keep in
mind that gold prices have declined in four of the
last five Federal Reserve tightening cycles, with
the only exception occurring during a period of
dollar weakness in the mid-2000s. Based on these
precedents, our expectation of two or three Federal
Reserve rate increases in 2017 does not bode well
for gold prices.
