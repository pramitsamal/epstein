see the most uplift in spending from any potentially large fiscal stimulus and
infrastructure spending under the new US administration.

Tax Policy: Unlike most semis, TXN reports its financials on a pure GAAP basis and its
tax rate at 30% is one of the highest in the industry. We think TXN stands to
disproportionately benefit from the looser tax policies foreshadowed by the upcoming
administration. Specifically, a 10% drop in the corporate tax rate would lead to 15%
higher EPS for TXN in 2017, all else equal.

Catalysts: (1) Seasonally stronger period for industrial/automotive spending — 46% of
TXN’s revenue come from these end markets; (2) Annual strategy and capital allocation
policy update call with shareholders which is likely to occur at the beginning of February.

1Q risks: (1} Still somewhat large (>10%) exposure to consumer electronics could create
near-term volatility in topline results; (2) Historically lumpy communications equipment
spending trends; (3) Larger than expected slowdown in North America automotive unit
production

1Q investment thesis

Despite easier y/y comps in 2017, we see risk that Click-based & Transaction Hotel
revenue continues to decline as 1) higher monetizing desktop traffic structurally
declines, 2) mobile monetization remains at 30% of desktop traffic and is unlikely to
meaningfully close the gap, and 3) Instant Book is unlikely to help reverse the revenue
and earnings trend. At the same time, TRIP has been accelerating marketing spend,
implying increasing acquisition costs, with further ad spend ramp in ‘17. TRIP noted
2017 EBITDA margin will decline further from 2016 levels as ad spend ticks up to re-
accelerate growth.
