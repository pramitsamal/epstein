any further rebalancing to be unhedged, strengthening USDJPY. We believe the
Republican sweep of Congress makes it very likely that HIA 2.0 will be passed
(Homeland Investment redux?}. Following the 2005 HIA, USD/JPY rose from 102 to
117 (Chart 20). Given US corporate exposure is heavily concentrated in European
and Asian countries (including Japan), flows out of these currencies into USD would

be the most pronounced.

Trade: We recommend buying a 6m USD/JPY digital call for 10% spot ref: 108.95).
The strike aligns with our end-2017 USD/JPY forecasts of 120, and with a 10%
entry level provides a 10 to 1 return. The risks to the trade are a decline in risk
sentiment, a retreat from the US Treasury’s “strong dollar” policy by the new
administration, and/or a failure of the US to meet already high expectations for

significant fiscal easing.

EM sovereign credit has more downside

Our bullish dollar + bearish US rate view leaves us bearish on EM. In our view, Mexico,
Brazil and Colombia (longer duration low spread foreign currency bonds) are especially
vulnerable, while the higher yield and lower duration of lower quality and shorter EM
bonds will be more defensive. A review of the taper tantrum (May 2013) shows that: 1)
EM underperformed UST at the start; 2) BBB sovereigns underperformed the most, and
had not yet recovered in a year; and 3) BB and B-rated bonds recovered to beat USTs 8-
10 months later. This time, we expect a sharp selloff with an eventual recovery.

Our bearish view on LatAm credits in particular is driven by 1) positioning in LatAm is
heavier than in EMEA or Asia — watch outflows from IG crossover investors who will
rethink their EM IG investments; 2) their exposure to commodities and 3) vulnerability to
a potential decline in US trade. Our choice of the basket is fairly obvious - Mexico is
clearly the most vulnerable to NAFTA and a decline in remittances, uncertainty on the
pace of the economic recovery and debt dynamics are extremely challenging in Brazil
while tax reform delays could mean a credit rating downgrade in Columbia.

Taking account of both oil and US rates as independent variables, a regression analysis
shows that a 100bp Tsy backup would be related to 30-45bp wider spread (Chart 22).

Note that residuals show spreads are currently about 35bp too tight.

The trade: Sell equally weighted basket of Mex 47s, Brazil 45s and Colom 44s
Current average yield: 5.74%, annual carry & roll 30bp; target: 6.35%; stop: 5.25%

On a portfolio basis for benchmark real money investors, we recommend moving out of
long higher quality LatAm, leaving higher yielding shorter bonds. A commodity price

rebound or a reversal of US rates is a risk to the trade.
