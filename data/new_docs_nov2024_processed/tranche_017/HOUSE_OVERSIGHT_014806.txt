Claims: Virginia Roberts says she twice met ex-president Bill Clinton, pictured last month, but was never
‘lent out'

Epstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over the years to candidates from the Democratic Party,
also flew with Mr Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including Russia, Oslo, Hong Kong, Shanghai
and Beijing.

Yet Virginia Roberts stresses that she was never ‘lent out’ to Mr Clinton.

On one occasion, she adds, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his
Caribbean island for Mr Clinton shortly after he left office. But, as far as she knows, the ex-President did
not take the bait. ‘Il’d have been about 17 at the time,’ she says. ‘I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and
then Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her.

talking about what a good job she did.‘l only ever met Bill twice but Jeffrey had told me that they were
good friends.

‘| asked, “How come?” and he laughed and said, “He owes me some favours.” Maybe he was just joking
but it constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as Bill and [Prince] Andrew weren’t more
