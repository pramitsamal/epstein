Once | express concern to Bebe that word might get out about my
“affairs” in Key Biscayne. “These girls,” | pointed out, “are likely to
brag about going to bed with a United States senator.”
“They’ re professionals,” Bebe reassured me. “It’s just like your
lawyer-client privilege. Stop worrying.”

One evening in 1949, while | was still serving in Congress, | received
an anonymous call at my home. A male voice said three words, “Watch
Jeane Dixon,” and hung up the telephone.

A week later, the psychic Jeane Dixon held a press conference. One
of the reporters asked her to predict my future. She drew a blank, however,
explaining that she needed time to meditate. | believe that in show
business parlance this is known as “milking the audience.” Finally she
said it: “| predict that one day Richard Nixon will become president of the
United States.”

| could only conclude that the higher source from which she had
received her intelligence was not necessarily supernatural. When | lost the
presidential election to John F. Kennedy in 1960, Jeane Dixon continued to
predict that | would be president. “Destiny,” she said, “cannot be

denied.”
