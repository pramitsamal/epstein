John Mitchell would get thoroughly briefed on whatever the issue
was—Haiphong Harbor or Senator Fulbright or the need for increased
spending—and then, without ever letting Martha know that he expected
her to give a scoop to some lucky reporter that evening, John would
simply smoke his pipe and just happen to engage her in casual

Martha was much too strong-willed to be /nstructed to make a call,
but she could be counted on to make the call, even if it was three 0’ clock

reporters. One little news item quoted her latest pronouncement, and after
the quote that sentence was completed with, “Martha Mitchell confided

But in the process of becoming a public character, she developed
many contacts in the media. By the time her husband became my
campaign manager, Martha Mitchell was already a household word. We
thought she would prove to be a wonderful asset until she started
blabbing about Watergate.
