conspiracy researcher. Off camera, | asked what the turning point had
been for him. He said that it was when his fiancée, a CIA operative, tried to
involve him in drug smuggling, and he refused. Ruppert and | were both
columnists for High Times then, but, he told me, “I don’ t smoke grass.”

The other panelist was scheduled to be former Nixon speechwriter
and now bespectacled, drone-voiced personality Ben Stein, but he
canceled out at the last minute. Ann Coulter, former Justice Department
attorney and Senate aide, now a professional reactionary and Stepford
pundit, was at the studio for a subsequent taping about secret societies,
and she was drafted into taking Stein’ s place. A frequent guest on talk
shows, Coulter is recognizable by her long blond hair, her short black skirt,
and her drag-queen aura.

When she was a guest on CNBC’ s 7he Big /dea, host Donny
Deutsch asked her what an ideal country would be like, and she replied
that it would be one in which everybody was a Christian. “We just want
Jews to be perfected,” she said. As for Muslims, two days after the
terrorist attacks on 9/11, she wrote in National Review Online “We
should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to
Christianity.” But now, the taping of 7he Conspiracy Zone had to be

delayed because she was still in the makeup room.
