drug use and other destructive temptations. Drug testing is as appropriate
for chess players as for shot-putters, or any other competitors who use
their heads as well as their hands.”

Accompanying the television image of a couple of eggs sizzling in a
frying pan, the phrase, “This is your brain on drugs” has always carried
negative connotations, but apparently General McCaffrey has changed his
mind about that. He now seems to believe that drugs can actually /mprove
the way your brain functions.

There was an infamous chess player named Alexander Alekhine who
held the world championship longer than anybody else. His games often
had superb surprise endings, known in chess circles as_ “brilliancies.” For
instance, he would checkmate with a pawn move that no sane and sober
mind could ever imagine. However, he was a notorious alcoholic, and
McCaffrey is only referring to illegal drugs.

“Just when | thought I’ d heard it all from McCaffrey,” was the
reaction of Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the NORML (National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) Foundation. “Drug
testing for chess players? What’ s next from this overreaching drug czar?

Drug testing for tiddlywinks players? How about bingo players?”
