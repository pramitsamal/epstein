trips, but there | was, a first-timer, standing in the open doorway, reversing

When | told my mother about taking LSD, she was quite concerned.
She warned me, “It could lead to marijuana.” And she was right. It did.

After Leary got arrested in Texas for possession of pot, the notoriety
of his research in Millbrook spread. Law enforcement in nearby
Poughkeepsie, led by Assistant District Attorney G. Gordon Liddy, raided
the estate. In the summer of 1966, Leary and his associates ran a two-week
seminar on consciousness expansion, culminating in a_ theatrical
production of Hesse's Steppenwo/flegend that weaved its way around the
Millbrook grounds and buildings. Leary invited Liddy and members of the
grand jury that indicted him, but none showed up.

Leary told me about prominent people whose lives had been
changed by taking LSD: actor Cary Grant, director Otto Preminger, think-
tanker Herman Kahn, Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill Wilson, 7/ME
magazine publishers Henry and Clare Boothe Luce. Of course, it wasn't so
difficult to drop out when you had such a stimulating scene to drop into.

for Spiritual Discovery (LSD), | signed up as their first heretic.
