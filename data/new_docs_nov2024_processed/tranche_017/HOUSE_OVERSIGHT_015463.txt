NAUTIL.US | TEXT SETS

Introducing
Nautilus Education

The modern world has placed an unprecedented emphasis on
science literacy. But most existing science texts do not emphasize
literacy, and most literary texts don’t have science.

This Nautilus Education text set pamphlet 1s a beta product
intended to fill this gap. It contains three groups of articles from the
award-winning science magazine, Nautilus, each accompanied by lesson
plans and guides for teachers.

Key science concepts like genetics and astronomy are explored
through narrative story telling and tailor-made artwork, letting science
spill over rts usual borders, and waking the imagination and interest of
the student. This kind of literary science classroom material was
designed to helps teachers satisfy the new U.S. common core and
next gen standards but have global application. The relevant standards
are listed in each lesson plan.

Nautilus is looking for partners interested in using and further
developing this kind of content. For more information, please write
to education@nautil.us.
