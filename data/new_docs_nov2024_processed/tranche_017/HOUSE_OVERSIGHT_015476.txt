You Are Made of Waste

Searching for the ultimate example of recycling? Look in the mirror

BY CURT STAGER

YOU MAY THINK OF YOURSELF asahighly refined and
sophisticated creature—and you are. But you are also
full of discarded, rejected, and recycled atomic
elements. Don’t worry, though—so is almost everyone

and everything else.

Carbon: Your inky nails

Look at one of your fingernails. Carbon makes up
half of its mass, and roughly 1 in 8 of those carbon
atoms recently emerged from a chimney or a tail-
pipe. Coal-fired power plants, petroleum-guzzling
cars, and kitchen gas stoves release carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere. Each of those waste molecules
is a carbon atom borne on two atomic wings of oxy-
gen. Fossil-based carbon dioxide molecules that are
not soaked up by the oceans or stranded in the upper
atmosphere are eventually captured by plants, shorn
of their oxygen wings, and woven into botanical sug-
ars and starches. Eventually, some of them end up in
bread, sweets, and vegetables, while others help form

carbon-rich animal tissues, finding their way into
meat and dairy products. Historically, atmospheric

carbon dioxide was mainly replenished by volcanoes,
forest fires, and biotic respiration. Today, one quarter of
atmospheric CO: is the result of fossil fuel combustion,
whether it rose from smokestacks or was displaced
from the oceans. (When fossil-fuel CO dissolves into
ocean water, it displaces already-dissolved carbon
dioxide derived from natural sources.) And because
all of the carbon in your body derives from ingested
organic matter, which in turn obtains it from the atmo-
sphere, your fingernails and the rest of the organic
matter in your body are built, in part, from emissions.
