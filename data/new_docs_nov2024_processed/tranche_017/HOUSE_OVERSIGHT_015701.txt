Man v Machine

re humans advanced computers with a temporary hold on the title,
‘most intelligent being on the planet; or are we fundamentally
different?

We are extraordinarily creative, but we can't add up as
well as a cheap pocket calculator. We have poor memories, but we can
use common sense to solve problems we have never seen before. Our
communication skills are woefully imprecise, but we can tell jokes that
send our fellow humans into paroxysms of laughter. We might conclude
humans are not computers, but the scientific consensus is that brains
are ‘wet computers. I don’t agree with this and I’m going to set out the
argument to show why man is not a computing machine.

There is an urban legend we think with only 10% of our brains. This
is not true. Science has mapped the vast majority of the human brain
using two methods. The first, an amazing set of noninvasive imaging
techniques, allows us to ‘see’ the brain as it thinks. The second is more
macabre: with seven billion humans on the planet, enough accidents
occur through sports injuries, car crashes and surgical mistakes to
provide a large enough sample to conduct research. Questioning
patients with brain-damage allows us to work out what the injured part
did before the accident.

One famous patient had an accident where the blade of a toy
sword went up his nose and damaged a small part of his amygdala and
hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for storing memory. This
rendered the man unable to lay down permanent memories after the
accident. Events before the accident remained clear but he could not
memorize new information. You could tell a joke and he would find it
