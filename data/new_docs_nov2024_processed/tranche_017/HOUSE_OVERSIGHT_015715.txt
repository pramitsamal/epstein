Intelligence

Ithough my computer appears to havea mischievous sense of humor

— deleting files and crashing just before important presentations

— it does not appear to enjoy listening to Bach, nor does it ever

ask me to put it near the window to admire the view. I think this means
it’s not intelligent, but what is ‘intelligence’?

Intelligence is hard to define; I usually conclude someone is
intelligent if I have an interesting conversation with them. In the
workplace we typically hire people based on interview, rather than
practical tests. Could a computer hold a conversation with me and
persuade me it is intelligent? Meet Eliza.

Invented by Joseph Weizenbaum of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, and named after George Bernard Shaw’s character in
Pygmalion, Eliza runs an algorithm pretending to be a psychiatrist
offering a sympathetic ear to anyone who cares to talk. Try her out at my
website or read the sample dialogue below!

User: Men are all alike.

Eliza: In what way?

USER: Men are all alike.

ELIZA: In what way ?

USER: They’re always bugging us about something or other.

ELIZA: Can you think of a specific example ?

USER: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.

ELIZA: Your boyfriend made you come here ?

USER: He says I’m depressed much of the time.

ELIZA: | am sorry to hear that you are depressed.

USER: It’s true. | am unhappy.
