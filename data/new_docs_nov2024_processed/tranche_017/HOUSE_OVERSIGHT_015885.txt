In 1890, the Cambridge mathematicians Alfred North Whitehead and
Bertrand Russell embarked on the mammoth task of writing out all the
rules of mathematics and publishing them ina set of books called Principia
Mathematica. Every rule is written down in meticulous detail. The books
are heavy going and look like more like computer programs than text.
They set out precisely what you can, and cannot, do with numbers, and
are the most impenetrable textbook you will ever read. Just to give you a
flavor here is one line where Russell proves 1+1=2. It has taken about 100
pages of densely packed equations to get to this point!

From this proposition it will follow, when arithmetical addition has been
detined, that 1+1= 2.

One Plus One Equals Two, PM
PM is a 3-volume set of books. Volume One costs £480 on
