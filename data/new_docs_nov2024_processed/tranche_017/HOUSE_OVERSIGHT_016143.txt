4) Industrial policy

Norway’s active use and introduction of a national industrial strategy has helped shelter
infant industries and create linkages between the natural resource-based industries and
other sectors of the economy. For two decades (1972-1994), preference was given in a
transparent fashion to local content in procurement to help build supply industries, and
provisions were set in for international firms to train nationals, use domestic service
industries and cooperate in R&D with local institutions. Though Norway pre-dates the
GCC in this development, the region shares in many ways some of these policies,
leading to the emergence of national champions. The main difference appears to relate
to the scope, extent and degree of innovation involved in offshoot industries at this
stage, in our view.
