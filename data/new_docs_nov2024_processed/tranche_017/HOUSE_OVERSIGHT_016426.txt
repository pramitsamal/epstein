District Attorney. Mr. Weinberg told me that he was unable to take a position on the Post’s
motion without first reviewing it and reserved the right to file an opposition, if necessary.

11. | On December 21, 2018, the Post filed a motion requesting an order unsealing the
appellate briefs and directing the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to produce copies with
the names of victims redacted (the “December 21 Motion”).

12. On or about December 28, 2018, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office filed an
affirmation in response to the Post’s motion, signed by Assistant District Attorney Karen
Friedman Agnifilo and dated December 28, 2018 (the “DA Affirmation”). A true and correct
copy of the Affirmation is annexed hereto as Exhibit E.

13. On January 2, 2019, I spoke with Ms. Friedman Agnifilo to discuss the DA
Affirmation. Ms. Friedman Agnifilo told me that there had been a miscommunication by Mr.
Frost and that the District Attorney’s Office did oppose the December 21 Motion. Ms. Friedman
Agnifilo also told me that, in the view of the District Attorney’s Office, the Post should give
notice of their motion to unseal the appeal briefs to the prosecutors in Florida that handled the
prosecution that led to Mr. Epstein’s conviction for solicitation of prostitution from a minor. The
Post disagrees with that position but nevertheless decided to moot any procedural issues related
to requirements to notify the Florida prosecutors. Ms. Friedman Agnifilo subsequently informed
me that the agency in Florida responsible for Mr. Epstein’s prosecution was the Palm Beach
County State Attorney’s Office.

14. On January 3, 2019, I received an email from Mr. Weinberg stating that “after
consideration of your request for the unsealing of the appellate briefs with redactions of certain
identities, we take no position on behalf of Mr. Epstein.” A true and correct copy of that email is

annexed hereto as Exhibit F.
