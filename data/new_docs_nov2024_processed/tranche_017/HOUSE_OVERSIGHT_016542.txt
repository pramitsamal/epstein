rationale that oversight of prosecutors lies in the political process rather than judicial enforcement of legal parameters for
charging. 7!8 Third, popular and political pressure has succeeded in redressing some underenforcement practices by
prosecutors (and police) when victim groups, or issues tied to specific offenses, achieve political potency. Intoxicated driving is
perhaps the best example of harmful wrongdoing about which many enforcement agencies have successfully revised their
policies to increase enforcement. 7!? Domestic violence and sexual assaults are other examples where enforcement shifts have
been more limited but still significant. °7°

Responses by local agencies to this type of pressure have taken three basic forms. First, chief prosecutors adopted internal
office policies that mandate - or set a strong presumption for - [*909] prosecution of specific crimes when evidence is
sufficient. 27! Second, prosecutors get specialized training on how to address the particular challenges posed by specific kinds
of cases such as domestic violence or sexual assault. **? Finally, many offices have established dedicated, in-house units of
prosecutors who specialize in these same kinds of crimes. 77+ States legislatures have encouraged these reforms, 774 but
virtually everywhere, the adoption, content, and enforcement of policies 1s left to local chief prosecutors. No legislation sets
specific charging criteria, authorized judicial review, or gives enforceable rights to victims. 77°

These responses to underenforcement are meaningful, but their form is more political than legal. They are the kinds of
responses produced by a system of electorally accountable prosecutors and legislatures. 7° Often they are in large part
attributable to successful political efforts by advocacy groups. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), for example,
successfully urged reforms of laws and enforcement practices against intoxicated driving. 77’ Feminist groups and women's
advocates play important, ongoing roles in reforming police and prosecution policies, substantive criminal laws, and evidence
rules for domestic [*910] violence and sexual assault offenses. 77° These efforts have succeeded in changing attitudes,
professional cultures, and enforcement practices in police and prosecution agencies that had contributed to underenforcement in
these areas. 7? Prosecution units specializing in offenses such as domestic violence, for example, strengthen professional
culture committed to enforcement by attracting lawyers who share that commitment and who develop expertise to act on it. 72°

comparative corruption issues).
