E. Case # 08-2514, 235 Sunrise Ave., C8, C.J.’s Simply Gourmet, Inc.
Violation of Chapter 46, Section 46-68 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, annual fire and life safety inspection fees not paid

Code Enforcement Officer Gerry presented the facts of the case and recommended
a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and
payment of the fire inspection fee in addition to any late penalties by July 21, 2008.
Mr. Gerry said he also tried, with negative results, to make contact with the owner
of this business as it is the same owner as the other case at this location. Mr.
Ochstein remarked that this was the same business which had been before the
Board previously and had even “bounced a check” to the Town and wanted to
know if there was something more that could be done other than the standard
$150.00 costs. Mr. Gerry said he could review the case further to see if it could be
brought back for additional fines. Mr. Hoffman asked if these cases were brought
to Code Enforcement by the Finance Department and Mr. Gerry said they came
from the Fire Prevention Bureau who handles their own billing and explained the
procedure for that. Mr. Hoffman said it seemed like a year was a long time for
these cases to be in arrears. Mr. Gerry said the cases were coming over quicker
now from Fire Prevention and he thought it would improve in the future.
