Eventually, after a long and torturous road through the Arizona courts, the death penalties against
Ricky, and Raymond Tison were reversed. They would not be executed, despite the Supreme
Courts green light. Once again, as with the issue of obscenity, the Highest Court did not get the
last word. We refused to give up, and in the end we prevailed. Ricky and Raymond are now
eligible for parole and may soon be free. Greenwalt, who was represented by other lawyers, was
executed.

Following the reversal of their death penalties, one of the brothers wrote me a letter saying that
his minister had told him that Jews can’t go to heaven. My client pleaded with me to convert to
Christianity so that we could spend eternity in the same place. I wrote him a nice letter back
saying that Jews believe that they can go to heaven. He wrote back telling me that he had decided
to become a Jew, because he wanted to be sure he would be in the same heaven that I was in. I
replied assuring him that I had checked, and that Jews and Christians go to the same heaven, so
that he didn’t have to convert.’

°! Another one of my clients, a far more sophisticated one, did convert to Judaism — on a weekly basis. He
discovered that all the Jews in a particular federal prison were taken out every Friday night to have Shabbat dinner
in the homes of local Jews where they were treated to wonderful home-cooked meals. He told me that since he had
become a Jew, he had gotten to love “those balls made out of fish and the other balls that they put in the chicken
soup.” I reminded him that he had always been a very religious Catholic, and he said, “Oh I’m still a religious
catholic. My priest has given me permission to be a Jew on Friday night as long as I go back to being a Catholic
for Sunday morning.”
