Marsha Clark without underwear

Marsha Clark may not have been the most sophisticated prosecutor I ever encountered, but she
certainly was among the most resourceful, employing everything she had to her advantage. In the
OJ Simpson case, Johnny Cochran was about to make his closing argument. As we walked to the
lecturn, Marsha Clark went over to him and whispered, “when you’re up there, I want you think
of only one thing: I’m not wearing any underwear.” When Johnny Cochran told me this story, I
was skeptical. So I called Marsha Clark and asked her. She told me, “Absolutely true.” I asked,
“which part of it was true: the fact that you told him you weren’t wearing any underwear or that
you weren’t, in fact, wearing any underwear?” She replied, “That’s one thing you’ll never know.”
