AAD OF WNHE

of 2009 about the Epstein meeting and some additional
investigation into the Epstein case.

Does that refresh your investigation as to
when you met with the investors in the
Discala/Clockwork Group?

A. It does not. The best thing to refresh my
recollection as to when ] met with them would be to
see the dea] documents.

Q. Okay. J unfortunately don't have those.

Do you recal] if you took Discala and his
other investors to a football game in 2009?

A. Sure, ] did.

Q. Okay. Would that be around the time you
were trying to get them to invest in the case?

A. It would have been around the time | was
trying to get them to invest in general. H's may
have been around the time that | was showing them the
Epstein file.

Q. Did you show them any files other than the
Epstein file?

A. I] may have. ] don't have a specific
recollection one way or the other.

Q. You testified earlier that you had over a
dozen boxes brought to your office that were related
to the Epstein case.

MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, counsel.
there has been no such testimony.
BY MS. HADDAD:

Q. You said there were several boxes brought to
your office by different people. You don't recall who
that is; is that correct?

A. Yes, ] had some boxes already in my office
and ] had Ken Jenne and some other people bring some
others. | don't remember how many boxes.

. Was it more than three?
Sure, it was more than three boxes, yes.
. Was it more than 10?
. ] don't believe so, no.
You stated that you looked -- ] don't want
to put words in your mouth. What did you look at
specifically in that case?

A. Other than looking at the flight manifest
that Russ Adler told me to look at, I have no specific
recollection as to what J looked at in that file.

Q. Do you know if there was more than one case
being prosecuted by your office against Mr. Epstein?
A. To the best of my recollection there were --

it was multiple plaintiffs.

Q. Okay. Do you recall if those cases were

pending in state or federal court?

Counsel,

A. | don't recall.

Q. Did you check?

A. 1] don't remember one way or the other. It
was insignificant to me,
Q. Well, then explain to me. You testified

earlier that what was important to the investors to
see is that there was a real case, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you look at or show them -- what
did you look at, first of all, to see if it was, in
fact, areal case?

A. | knew it was a real case.

Q. How did you know?

A. Because my lawyers told me it was a real
case. ] believed them.

Q. What Jawyers told you that?

A. | already told you it was a mixture of Russ
and Jaffe and Fistos and Farmer and Mr. Edwards. 1
mean, ] knew it was areal case. We had all these
boxes, we had people really working on the file --

Q. How do you know --

A. -- or they were pulling a hell of a scam on
me. Not that] didn't deserve it but ...

Q. How did you know, you just said you knew
people were working really hard on this case. Who do

Page 52

you know was working on the case?

A. The only people that ] knew for certain were
working on the case was Brad Edwards and Russ Adier
was doing his supervisory schtick, whatever that was.
But other than that, ] don't know which other lawyers
were assisting Mr. Edwards. | didn't get involved at
that level.

As far as the Ponzi scheme goes, the only
thing ] cared about, Tonja, was being able to show the
investors that this case that ] was utilizing to steal
a significant amount of money from them was a real

“case. That's all 1 cared about,
Q. That case came into your office through
Mr. Edwards, correct? He brought it with him when he
came to RRA?
A. Yes.
Q. He was lead counsel on the case, correct?
A. l assume he was Jead counsel. J never
checked to see if he listed himself as lead counsel.
Q. Do you know if any additional complaints
were filed while the case was at RRA?
A. I have no idea one way or the other.

Q. Did you ever instruct, in furtherance of

your Ponzi scheme, Mr. Edwards or anyone in that

litigation group to file additional complaints?
