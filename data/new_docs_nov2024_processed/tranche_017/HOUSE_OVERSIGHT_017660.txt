2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *896

Even where the defendant can establish need, it may be the case that victims’ safety interests will prevail. For example, in
United States v. Wills, the district court allowed the government to delay the disclosure of the name of a witness because the
witness feared for her safety and the defendant had a violent history. !°* On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the defendant sought
reversal of his conviction, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in finding good cause to permit the government
to withhold [the witness] from its alibi rebuttal list and witness list. 19? Before his trial, Wills had provided the government
with the name of one alibi witness. In response, the government filed a sealed, ex parte application under Rule 12.1(e) seeking
an exception to its obligation to disclose its alibi rebuttal witness to the defense. !°4 Based on the defendant's violent history
and apparent ability to induce others to commit crimes on his behalf, the court allowed the government to delay the
disclosure of the witness. !?>

The Wills court noted that two other circuits had addressed or commented on the issue. The Sixth Circuit, in United States v.
Causey, held that good cause existed to justify the nondisclosure of a witness to the defense. !°° The Causey court found
evidence in the record indicating that witnesses were being threatened in an attempt to prevent them from testifying. !°7 In
such a situation, the physical safety and protection of potential witnesses constitutes a proper consideration of a trial court in
determining whether good cause exists to justify nondisclosure of witnesses to opposing counsel and thus noncompliance with
Rule 12.1. 198 Similarly, in United States v. Elizondo, the Seventh Circuit cited Causey for the proposition that the protection
of potential witnesses could justify postponing disclosure. '°? Following the reasoning of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits, Wills
held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that good cause existed to authorize the Government to delay
disclosure of [the witness's] identity. 7°°

The Advisory Committee might respond to these criticisms of its proposal by pointing to discretionary language; the proposed.
rule states that the court may order production of the evidence or the fashioning of an alternative procedure. But given the
obvious safety concerns that attend disclosure of the victim's home [*897] address to the defense, the Advisory Committee
should exercise extreme caution. More important, courts have no discretion to ignore the commands of the CVRA. Courts must
always protect a victim's right to be reasonably protected from the accused. 7°! The proposed rule does not faithfully
implement that instruction. Indeed, the safety problems attendant to the Advisory Committee's proposal are heightened by fact
that disclosure is authorized to the defendant or the defendant's attorney. It does not take a great deal of imagination to
foresee problems arising from telling criminal defendants where the victims who will testify against them live. In fairness to the
Advisory Committee, it was only tracking language used elsewhere in Rule 12. 7°? All of Rule 12 should be redrafted to
require disclosure only to defense counsel, rather than to the defendant personally. 7°
