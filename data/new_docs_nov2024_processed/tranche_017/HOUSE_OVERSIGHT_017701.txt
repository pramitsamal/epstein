516 as do some states. >!7 To ensure that the

prosecutors and their agents to provide notice to crime victims for their rights,
Justice Department has sufficient resources to provide notice, the CVRA authorizes $ 25 million over the next five fiscal years
to the Office for Victims of Crime of the Department of Justice for enhancement of victim notification systems. *!® The
Advisory Committee should therefore add language to its proposed rule change to require prosecutors to give victims notice of

their rights.
[*954] (New) Rule 60(a)(1) - Proceeding Without Notice to a Victim The Proposals:

I proposed spelling out what would happen in circumstances where a court wanted to proceed with a hearing but no notice had
been given to a victim as follows:

(b) Proceeding With and Without Notice. The court may proceed with a public proceeding without a victim if proper notice has
been provided to that victim under Rule 10.1. The court may proceed with a public proceeding (other than a trial or sentencing)
without proper notice to a victim only if doing so is in the interest of justice, the court provides prompt notice to that victim of
the court's action and of the victim's right to seek reconsideration of the action if a victim's right is affected, and the court

ensures that notice will be properly provided to that victim for all subsequent public proceedings. *!°

The Advisory Committee did not propose any such change. **°
Discussion:

It seemed desirable to me to spell out how courts should proceed when victims lacked notice of a hearing. In contrast, the
Advisory Committee has chosen not to address the subject.

By not addressing the subject, the Advisory Committee may be suggesting that the court is forbidden from moving forward
when a victim has not been given notice of a proceeding. The caselaw makes clear that when a defendant has not been given
notice, any subsequent court action is void. >?! The CVRA's legislative history shows that the same rule was to apply for
victims. As Senator Kyl explained,

It does not make sense to enact victims’ rights that are rendered useless because the victim never knew of the proceeding at

which the right had to be asserted. Simply put, a failure to provide notice of proceedings at which a right can be asserted is

equivalent to a violation of the right itself. >?

[*955] In light of the fact that a court might otherwise be barred from proceeding when a victim has not been given notice, it
still seems preferable to me to spell out a way to allow the court to move forward while simultaneously protecting victims'
interests. But I will not elaborate the point further here.

(New) Rule 60(a)(2) - Victims' Right to Attend Trials Both the Advisory Committee and I proposed a rule that guarantees
victims the right to attend court proceedings except in those very rare instances where the victim's testimony would be

517 See, e.g., Ala. Code. § 15-23-62 (LexisNexis 1995) (requiring law enforcement officers to give victims initial description of their rights
and the name and telephone number of the office of the prosecuting attorney to contact for further information).

Kyl) (We authorized an appropriation of to assure ... that moneys would be made available to enhance the victim notification system,
managed by the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime, and the resources additionally to develop state-of-the-art systems for
notifying crime victims of important states of development.) (emphasis added).

to track the Advisory Committee's nomenclature.
