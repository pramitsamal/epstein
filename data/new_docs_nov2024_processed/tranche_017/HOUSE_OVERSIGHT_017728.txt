2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *857

[*858] Rule 1 also appears to be the best place to include the CVRA's language about a representative of a victim. This
language, too, draws from the restitution statutes. !?7

Rule 2 - Fairness to Victims in Construction
The Proposal:
Rule 2 should be amended to require fairness to victims in construing the rules as follows:

These rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in
procedure and fairness in administration to the government, defendants, and victims, and to eliminate unjustifiable expense and
delay.

The Rationale:

The CVRA broadly mandates that victims have the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity
and privacy. !?8 This creates a substantive right to fairness, similar to that found in various state victims' rights amendments -
including the [*859] amendment found in Senator Kyl's home state of Arizona. !°? This broad reading was explained by
Senator Kyl, who, along with Senators Feinstein and Hatch, was the primary legislative sponsor of the CVRA: The broad
rights articulated in this section are meant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just be aspirational. One of these
rights is the right to be treated with fairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process. 13°

In light of victims’ new substantive right to fairness, Rule 2 should be amended to make clear that all of the rules must be
construed to be fair to victims no less than to the government and defendants.

(New) Rule 10.1 - Notice of Proceedings for Victims
The Proposal:
A new Rule 10.1 should be added to guarantee victims their right to notice of proceedings as follows:

Rule 10.1 Notice to Victims.

crime deserve to have their rights protected, whether or not they are the victim of the count charged. See 150 Cong. Rec. $10,910-01 (daily
ed. Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl). At least one court has suggested that, as a matter of discretion, it is desirable to notify even victims
of uncharged conduct under the CVRA. See United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 327 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (concluding that, absent
reason to think otherwise, any person who the government asserts has been harmed by a crime or who self-identifies as such qualifies as a
victim); cf. In re WR. Huff Asset Mgmt. Co., 409 F.3d 555, 561 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that the CVRA does not grant victims any rights
against individuals not convicted of a crime, but the government can attempt to obtain voluntary restitution from such persons).

27 See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3663A(a) (same definition of victim representative).

128 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(8) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).

29 See, e.g., Ariz. Const. art. II, 2(A)(1) (victim's right to be treated with fairness, respect, and dignity); see also Alaska Const. art. I, 24
(victim's right to be treated with dignity, respect, and fairness during all phases of the criminal and juvenile justice process); Idaho Const.

their dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process); N.J. Const. art. I, P 22 (victim's right to be treated with fairness,
compassion and respect by the criminal justice system); N.M. Const. art. II, 24 (the right to be treated with fairness and respect for the
victim's dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process); Ohio Const. art. I, 10a (victims shall be accorded fairness, dignity,
and respect in the criminal justice process); Tex. Const. art. I, 30(a)(1) (right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's
dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process); Utah Const. art. I, 28(1)(a) (victim's right to be treated with fairness, respect,
and dignity); Wis. Const. art. I, 9m (victim's right to be treated with fairness, dignity and respect for their privacy). See generally Cassell,
