In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 392 F.Supp.2d 539 (2005)

10 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 789

connections with the Committee for the Defense of
Legitimate Rights (“CDLR”) and the Advice and
Reformation Committee (“ARC”), two dissident Saudi
groups with ties to Osama bin Laden. (Burnett Compl. Jf
561-62.) A radical Arabic publication allegedly provided
a phone number registered in Hamdi’s name when it
advertised the contact information of CDLR’s U.S.
branch. (Burnett Compl. § 580.) CDLR published bin
Laden’s October 12, 1996 fatwa on the Muslim Students
Association listserve, the “MSA News.” (Burnett Compl.
4 584.) Plaintiffs claim that ARC allegedly serves as al
Qaeda’s front in the United Kingdom and facilitates
communication to and from Osama bin Laden. (Burnett
Compl. Jf 562, 564, 575, 577, 584-85.) Hamdi is also
alleged to have connections to Khalid al-Fawwaz, one of
the masterminds of the embassy bombings. (Burnett
Compl. § 582.) Finally, Plaintiffs claim Hamdi is a
co-conspirator with the SAAR Network. He worked at
IIT in Herndon, Virginia, “the central address
surrounding the SAAR Foundation raids, evidence and
investigation.” (Burnett Compl. F§ 267, 583; Federal
Compl. ¥ 146, 224.)

Hamdi asserts that he is a journalist. He argues that ABC
requested that he arrange the interview with Osama bin
Laden and that he did not purchase the phone or battery
pack. He claims he has not had any ties to CDLR since
1995. He admits that he worked at IIIT as an editor. These
factual disputes cannot be resolved on a 12(b)(6) motion.

Bl The Federal Plaintiffs have not alleged that Mr.
Hamdi participated in the operation or management of
any enterprise. The RICO claims against Mr. Hamdi must
be dismissed. See Redtail Leasing, Inc. v. Bellezza, 1997
WL 603496 at *5. Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Hamdi knew
about bin Laden’s terrorist activities at the time he
procured a phone for him because the first fatwas had
already been issued. They allege he provided material
support to bin Laden in the form of a satellite phone
battery. The ATA includes communications equipment in
its definition of material support. See 18 U.S.C. §
2339A(b). “[E]ven small donations made knowingly and
intentionally in support of terrorism may meet the
standard for civil liability in section 2333.” Boim II, 291
F.3d at 1015. These allegations are sufficient to notify Mr.
Hamdi of the claims against him. Tarik Hamdi’s motions
to dismiss the Burnett and Federal complaints are denied.

B. Abdulrahman Alamoudi*
Defendant Abdulrahman Alamoudi has connections with
several organizations that the Burnett and Federal
Plaintiffs claim support terrorism. He is Vice President of

WESTLAW

Taibah International Aid Association’s U.S. branch.
(Federal Compl. | 245.) Plaintiffs claim Taibah was
implicated in the 1998 embassy bombings. (Federal
Compl. ff 66, 239, 244.) Additionally, Taibah allegedly
works closely with designated-terrorist Global Relief
Fund and SHC and has diverted funds to al Qaeda and its
affiliates in Bosnia. (Federal Compl. JJ 241, 243.)
Through Taibah, Alamoudi is also connected with several
SAAR Network entities, including American Muslim
Council, American Muslim Foundation, Hajj Foundation,
Happy Hearts Trust, IIRO, and Success Foundation.
(Federal Compl. JJ 245, 490; Burnett Compl. F¥ 237,
248.) He allegedly used his SAAR connections to funnel
money to al Qaeda *568 through various fronts. (Federal
Compl. § 247.)

Plaintiffs allege that Alamoudi has openly stated his
support for Hamas and Hezbollah, both designated
terrorist organizations that cooperate with al Qaeda.
(Federal Compl. Jf 50, 53 Burnett Compl. § 237.)

In August 2003, Alamoudi was detained at Heathrow
Airport on his way to Syria. Customs officers seized
approximately $340,000 in sequentially numbered bills,
two U.S. passports, and one Yemeni passport. (Federal
Compl. 7 246.) Alamoudi was arrested by U.S. officials at
Washington Dulles Airport on September 28, 2003.
(Federal Compl. § 247.) He subsequently pleaded guilty
to unlicensed travel to and commerce with Libya, false
statements on his naturalization application, and tax
offenses involving Libyan financial transactions. (Federal
Mem. in Opp’n at 6.) He is currently serving a
twenty-three year sentence. (/d.)

31] 82] 33] The Burnelf complaint does not allege any act
taken by Mr. Alamoudi that could be considered the
provision of material support for al Qaeda. The Federal
complaint is sustained inasmuch as it claims that Mr.
Alamoudi funneled money to al Qaeda through the
charities with which he was involved. (Federal Compl. Jf
241, 243.) See 18 U.S.C. § 2339(A) (including “currency
or other financial securities [and] financial services” in
definition of material support). This claim puts Mr.
Alamoudi on notice that he is alleged to have provided
financial material support to al Qaeda. Because the
Federal complaint does not allege that Mr. Alamoudi had
any role in directing an enterprise, however, the RICO
claims against Mr. Alamoudi are dismissed. In sum, Mr.
Alamoudi’s motion to dismiss the Burnett complaint is
granted; his motion to dismiss the Federal complaint is
denied.
