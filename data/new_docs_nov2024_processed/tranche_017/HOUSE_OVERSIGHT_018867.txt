Monday is Veterans Day, but the
whole month of November is
Military Appreciation Month, and a
series of activities are planned to
honor and pay tribute to those who
fought for our country.

Today, veterans will visit two St.
Croix schools to give presentations
to students.

Members of American Legion Post
102 will be “teachers for a day” at
Ricardo Richards Elementary School.
They also will present gifts to the
school and administer an essay con-
test for students.

American Legion Post 133 will be
at Arthur Richards Jr. High School
talking to students about veterans
issues.

“These are things they’re doing
through the week to celebrate
Veterans Day and National Education
Week,” American Legion District
Commander Charles David said.

Parades and programs honoring
the territory’s veterans will take place
Sunday and Monday.

Sunday, St. Thomas will host a
Veterans Day Parade and ceremony.
The parade starts at 3 p.m. at Addelita
Cancryn Junior High School and
travels to Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Veterans Memorial Park.

Retired Army Sgt. Ist Class Patrick
Farrell will be the parade marshal,
and the ceremony will feature retired
Lt. Col. Marilyn Georges of the U.S.
Marine Corps as the guest speaker.

On Monday, St. Croix and St. Jolm
will host Veterans Day parades and
programs.

On St. Croix, the parade starts at
9:30 a.m. sharp at Bassin Triangle and
ends at the Christiansted grandstand.

“This year we have as our parade
marshal retired Sgt. Major. Monroe
F. Clendenden Jr.” David said.

At the bandstand, the guest speak-
er will be Virdin C. Brown, the civil-
ian aide to the secretary of the Army
for the Virgin Islands.

David said many youths will be
participating in the parade including
the marching bands from Central
High School] and St. Croix
Educational Complex, the Boy
Scouts, and the Girl Scouts.

The American Legion will also
have a large contingent marching in
the parade, he said.

“It should be a good parade, just
remembering and thanking the veter-
ans for their service and all they’ve
done helping to keep us free,” David
said.

On St. John, the parade will start at
3 p.m. in Cruz Bay, followed by a
program in Franklin Powell Park.

David said the parade marshal will

be Elmo Rabsett Sr., and Georges also
will be the guest speaker on St. John.

“We're expecting the governor to
make presentations at all of these
events,” David said.

On Thursday, a tree planting cere-
mony will take place 5:30 p.m. in
Frederiksted at Verne Richards
Veterans Park.

“That will more or less close out
the week for Veterans,” David said.

Gov. John deJongh Jr. granted all
government workers administrative
leave Monday to participate in the
festivities honoring the territory’s
veterans.

“lL urge all residents of the territory
to remember the sacrifices and con-
tributions of all those who, when
called upon to do so, served this ter-
ritory and this nation honorably in
time of war and peace to preserve our
hetitage of freedom,” deJongh stated
in hts Veterans Day proclamation.

“We must rededicate ourselves to
the task of promoting world peace as
the most profound reward which we
might bestow upon our veterans.”
