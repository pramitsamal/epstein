ST. THOMAS — Luke Neely
might not know where to begin if he
were in an opposing coach’s posi-
tion and had to gameplan against his
St. Thomas-St. John Private Schools
Arawaks. The variety of formations
running through his no-huddle
offense can be a headache for
defenses.

“It’s difficult,” Neely said. “We're
a multi-formation, multi-game
| offense. We run a power game, a gap
scheme to zone scheme. It’s a lot to
prepare for. Teams could potentially
stop us.”

Ivanna Eudora Kean High School
(1-3) hopes to tum that potential into
reality when the two teams meet at 7
tonight in an IAA tackle football
‘game at Lionel Roberts Stadium.

The Arawaks (2-1) crushed the
Devil Rays, 44-0, in the season open-
er, which ended early in the fourth
quarter because of the league’s mercy
rule.

“Wehope that the defense, by now,
has leamed the schemes,” Kean High
coach Elroy Donovan Jr. said. “It was
the first game of the season and we

have a lot of young guys.”

Donovan is eager to see if his
defense learned from the tough les-
sons ‘handed out by the Arawaks’
senior tailback tandem of Chris
Cilliers and David McDonald.

Cilliers pounded his way to two
rushing touchdowns and a receiving
touchdown, and McDonald led the
team with 75 rushing yards on seven
carries. At 210 pounds, Cilliers can
easily shed routine tackles.

“He’s a big, strong guy,” Donovan
said. “Our guys have to realize that
you have to adjust for that type of
running back. We can’t expect to
wrap him up high and take him
down.”

At 170 pounds, McDonald offers a
speedy change of pace. But he won't
shy away from contact.

“They're tough guys to bring
down,” Neely said. “They’re bruis-
ers and it’s gonna take two or three
guys to bring them down at any
time.”

ST. THOMAS — There is no question who
the vocal leader is on the Ivanna Eudora Kean
High School girls varsity volleyball team.
Chantell Grant can be heard loud and clear after
nearly every point.

After dropping the first game by 11 points
against Ss. Peter and Paul on Thursday at Keap
High, Grant and the Lady Rays began commv-
nicating. The result was a loose, energetic and
more confident team through the next three

25, 26-24, 25-16,25-18).

“T got to cheer them up,” Grant said. “That's
that motivation. My team’s gonna back me up
too, you know.”

Grant backed up her talk and recorded two
consecutive aces in the final game to push the
lead to 17-9. She was also involved in a signa-

players on three different hits had to lunge and
punch at the ball with one hand to keep the vol-
ley alive.

The Lady Jaguars were stunned when Kean
sophomore Akia Frett finished that point by hitting
