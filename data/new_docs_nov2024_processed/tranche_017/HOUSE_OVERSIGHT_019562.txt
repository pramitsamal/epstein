CHAPTER 8
Raider of the Inner Sanctum

They think there’s a smoking gun in there that would be the
death of them all politically.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2014

HE NIGHTMARE OF THE NSA is a penetration. As the CIA, the

FBI, and the NSA found out in the 1990s, no intelligence service
is invulnerable to it. Any employee of a large intelligence organiza-
tion can turn, or be turned, against it. Among the more than ten
thousand intelligence workers employed by the NSA, it is a near
certainty that over time more than one of them will become dis-
satisfied with their work. A worker may have a personal grievance
about salary, lack of promotion, or treatment by his or her superi-
ors. Disenchantment with the NSA may also proceed from idealis-
tic objections. The NSA is in the business of secretly intercepting
messages, and an insider could come to find its spying activities at
odds with his or her own beliefs about the violation of privacy. For
any of these reasons, a disgruntled insider could go rogue. He or she
then might attempt to right a perceived wrong by disclosing NSA
secrets to another party. That party might then induce or blackmail
the rogue employee into disclosing further secrets.
