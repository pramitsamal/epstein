President Trump, is a substantial improvement to CFIUS, closing loopholes that the Chinese
had been exploiting and broadening the scope of the CFIUS authorities in important ways.
The new law extends CFIUS review time-frames, increases the types of transactions
subject to CFIUS’ jurisdiction, makes certain notifications mandatory, and establishes a
process for potentially expedited review and approval of certain transactions. The four
new “covered transactions” include real estate deals near US national security facilities,
deals involving “critical infrastructure” or “critical technologies,” changes in ownership
rights by a foreign investor, and any transaction designed to evade the CFIUS process. In
exchange for all these additional burdens, the new law also helps companies by clarifying
time limits for decisions and places important jurisdictional limits on the expansion of the
law’s scope.
