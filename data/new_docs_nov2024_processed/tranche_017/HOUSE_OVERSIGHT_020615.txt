FRANCE

France is the Western European country with the most favorable disposition toward
China historically, dating back to the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1964.
Yet, it is also the EU country where public opinion toward China is the most negative,
overtaking Italy in 2017. As in other countries, it is difficult to distinguish between the
voluntary exposure to influence by French seeking to benefit from China’s rise and
active efforts by Beijing to exploit French vulnerabilities.

Both the Left and Right in France have supported close ties with China. The dual
nature of these ties differs from other European countries where for the most part
the Left has been critical of US policy in Asia and supportive of China and Vietnam.
In France’s case, it was the Right, under Charles de Gaulle, which recognized China
in January 1964 and criticized US policy during the Vietnam War. So, for example, in
January 2014, an all-night celebration for the fiftieth anniversary of the recognition
was held in Paris with funding largely from major French firms operating in China.
