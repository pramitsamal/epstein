DuSan Krtolica is a 16-year-old artist from Serbia who creates intricate pencil drawings of both real and mythical animals.

Even though the artist is still young, he has plenty of experience under his belt — more specifically, 14 years of it.

The artist started drawing when he was just 2 years old and says it is his greatest passion. He finds inspiration in nature
and is fascinated by animals and their diversity as well as their ability to adapt to different environments. Throughout his
career as an artist, DuSan already had 6 solo exhibitions, participated in TV shows and even written and published

an encyclopedia of the prehistoric world when he was just thirteen.
