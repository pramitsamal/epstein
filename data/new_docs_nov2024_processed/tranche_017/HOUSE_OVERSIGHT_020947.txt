USA Inc. Net Worth:

-$44 Trillion in Perspective

There are doubts about the accuracy of such a big negative number, especially when the value
of USA Inc.’s assets is so hard to calculate. The value of natural resources, the power to tax,
the ability to print the world’s reserve currency, the human capital in our educational system —
these and other assets would clearly reduce that number, if they could be accurately
calculated.

Given the differences between government and corporate accounting, what matters is not the
exact number, but the trend — which is clearly moving in the wrong direction. Liabilities have
been growing faster than assets. Just to put that $57 trillion into context...

-$44 Trillion = $142,999 per Person in USA'
