Then, Aim to Determine What ‘Normal’ Is...

e We review 40-year income statement patterns and focus on
‘average’ / ‘normal’ levels of USA Inc.’s revenue drivers
(primarily related to taxes) and expense drivers (by category)
as a percent of revenue, as a starting point to help define
‘average’ / ‘normal.’

e Established businesses typically determine their expense
levels based on their revenue trend / outlook.

e In a perfect world, the government (and its citizens) would
continually review the multiple variables in the income
statement of USA Inc. (in a bipartisan way) and would

work hard to foster compromise, in order to optimize
revenue and expenses for the long term AND the short term.
