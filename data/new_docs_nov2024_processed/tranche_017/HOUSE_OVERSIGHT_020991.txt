Key Issues:

- Consumers understandably do not
like constraints on their care
location.

- Doctors, nurses and hospitals are
fulfilling a difficult task at the core of
the healthcare delivery system.

- Care providers are very important
to local communities.

- Local hospitals are large
employers.

- Many hospitals are struggling
financially.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors—
Healthcare Service Providers are Already “Underpaid” by Government

USA Community Hospital Profit Margins & Inpatient Discharges by Payor Class

32%

Profit margins by
payor class (%),
2007

Percent of total
inpatient
discharges, by
payor class
(%), February

Profit margins from patients
with employer sponsored
insurance are sufficient to
leave hospital industry with
positive overall margin,
despite being only 36% of
inpatient discharges.

Reimbursement cuts to
Medicare and/or Medicaid
would pose significant
challenges, as hospitals
already realize negative
margins from those payor
classes.
