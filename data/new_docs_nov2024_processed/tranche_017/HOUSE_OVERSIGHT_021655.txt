4A THE PALM BEACH POST

e WEDNESDAY, JUNE 10, 2009

Public has right to know details

of deal, Post attorney will claim

pb EPSTEIN from 1A

such as protecting a trade
secret or a compelling gov-
ernment interest.

Yet no notification
or reason occurred in
Epstein’s case, according
to court records.

Epstein’s own attorneys,
in federal filings, have
referred to his confiden-
tial deferred prosecution
agreement with the US,
attorney's office, struck in
September 2007, as “un-
precedented” and “highly
unusual.” And it was “a

significant . inducement” —

for Epstein to accept the
state’s deal, observed the
state judge who accepted
his plea, County Judge
Deborah Dale Pucillo.

Epstein now faces at
least a dozen civil lawsuits
in federal and state courts
filed by young women who
said they had sex with
him and now are seeking
damages.

Attorneys for some of
those women want his
agreement with federal

_ prosecutors unsealed and

will ask Circuit Judge Jet
frey Colbath to do.so today.

‘Tt is against public
policy for these documents
to be have been sealed and
hidden from public scrutiny.
As a member of the public,
EW. has a right to have
these documents unsealed,”
wrote former Circuit Judge
Bill Berger, now in-private

practice and representing
one of the women.

The Palm Beach Post also
will ask Colbath to unseal
the agreement. Post attor-
ney Deanna Shullman will
argue that the public has a
right to know the specifics
of Epstein’s deal.

According to various
media accounts, Epstein
moved in circles that in-
cluded President Clinton,
Donald, Trump and Prince
Andrew. “International

'Moneyman of Mystery,” de-

clared a 2002 New York mag-
azine profile of Epstein.
Epstein, 56, is in the
Paltn Beach County Stock
ade, serving an 18-month
sentence after pleading
guilty nearly a year ago
to felony solicitation of
prostitution and procuring
teenagers for prostitution.
He is allowed out from 7
am. to 11 pm., escorted by
a deputy, said Palm Beach
County Sheriffs Office
spokeswoman Teri Barbera.
During a Palm Beach
Police Department
vestigation, five victims
and 17 witnesses gave
statements. They told of
young women brought by
his assistants to Epstein’s
mansion on El Brillo Way
for massages and sexual
activity, and then béing
paid afterward.
At Epstein’s plea confer-
ence last year, his attorney,
Jack Goldberger,

in- .

and.
then-Assistant State At-

4

torney Lanna Belohlavek |
approached Pucillo in
a sidebar conference.
Pucillo, who had left the
bench nine years earlier, ,
was filling in temporarily
as a senior judge. °
According to atranscript,
Goldberger told Pucillo that ,
Epstein had entered a con-
fidential agreement with '
the US. attorney's office
in which federal prosecu-
tors brokered not pursuing
charges against him if he
pleaded guilty in state

court. Pucillo then said she |
wanted a sealed copy ofthe |

agreement filed in his case,
and Goldberger concurred
that he wanted it sealed.
Belohlavek later signed off
on it.

The Florida Supreme
Court has expressed “seri-
ous concern’ and launched
an all-out inquiry into seal-
ing procedures across the
state following media re-
ports in 2006 of entire cases

being sealed and disappear |

ing from court records.
“The publics constitu-
tional right ofaccess to court
records must remain invio-
late, and this court is. fully
committed to safeguarding
this right,”.justices wrote in

their final report.
Epstein’s office on
Tuesday referred any

questions to Goldberger,
who declined to comment.
Pucillo also has declined
to comment.
