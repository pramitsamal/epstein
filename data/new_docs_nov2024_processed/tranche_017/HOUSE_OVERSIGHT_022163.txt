Epstein; they obviously put Prince Andrew in there in order
to get massive publicity around the world. And every media
in the world, practically, called me, from the BBC to CBS to
ABC to CNN, and I responded to lies with the truth.

- And the truth that you attempted to convey was that Bradley
Edwards and Professor Paul Cassell were unethical lawyers
who fabricated false charges against you, right?

- The truth that I intended to convey was that the charges
against me were false and fabricated, that 1 never had any
sexual contact—

- Fabricated by whom, sir?

- Please don’t interrupt me. ...that I never had any sexual con-
tact with Virginia Roberts. Because Professor Cassell insisted

on conveying to the public that he was a former judge and —

that he was a professor and that he was using —improperly,
in my view—the stationery and name of his university to
add credibility to his claims, | felt that it was imperative for
me to indicate that he was engaging in improper and unethi-
cal conduct. It would have been improper for me to have
allowed his use of his credibility as a former federal judge, as
a professor who uses, misuses, his university imprimatur —
it was very important for me to attack the credibility of the

messengers of the false information. And it was important =
for me to also remind the public that Bradley Edwards was a 2
partner of [Scott] Rothstein, a man who is spending fifty a
years in jail for fraudulently creating a Ponzi scheme to sell 4

Jeffrey Epstein cases that didn’t exist.
