Corporate bribery is bad business. In our free market system it is basic that the
sale of products should take place on the basis of price, quality, and service.
Corporate bribery is fundamentally destructive of this basic tenet. Corporate
bribery of foreign officials takes place primarily to assist corporations in gaining
business. Thus foreign corporate bribery affects the very stability of overseas
business. Foreign corporate bribes also affect our domestic competitive climate
when domestic firms engage in such practices as a substitute for healthy com-

petition for foreign business.
