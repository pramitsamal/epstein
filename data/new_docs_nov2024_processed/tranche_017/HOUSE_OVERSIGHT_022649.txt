Well, your post just proved my point about not being able to base an idea independent from a political view.

About categorizing a populace: anyone intelligent enough to think for themselves isn’t going to need me to
validate their self-worth, and realises within themselves that this label doesn’t apply to them.

Good thing it was on here for a moment or two, because once the powers that be get their paws on this, Bubba,
The Pervert info, they will bend over backward to make it disappear from view.

By the time 2016 rolls around, Hillary and the co-president (Bubba) will be scrubbed squeaky clean and she’ll
be so sanitized, the Pope will bow to her when she deigns to meet him.

I find the funniest thing is the word “Choice” has been taken over by the pro-abortion mob, and the stupid
people of the former united States don’t have any choice, anymore, period.

If we had a smidgen of Choice anymore, the Clintons would be whining about getting paroled from their
original prison sentences for wasting Vince Foster — on, get this, humanitarian grounds.

We have no choice. All you have to do is open your eyes and you’|l see that we’re still nothing but the serfs
