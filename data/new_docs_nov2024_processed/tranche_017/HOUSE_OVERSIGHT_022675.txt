But sometimes stories that seem too good to be true — just might be. A detailed review by a team of BuzzFeed News reporters of
more than 2,000 pages of pleadings, depositions, affidavits, police reports, flight logs, and other documents filed in state and federal
court found that many of the most provocative allegations about Clinton have little to no factual foundation and are exaggerated at
best; that the documents — which appear to be the source for nearly all current reporting on this subject — themselves never suggest
that Clinton was doing more than using his wealthy friend as a kind of global taxi service; and that many of the most lurid insinuations

have been floated without any visible support from verifiable information.

While it’s still possible that some Rosetta stone of Clintonian depravity will surface from a pair of ongoing lawsuits involving Epstein, the
fact that nothing even close to that has been dug up over the course of a half-dozen years of heated litigation should not be

encouraging for Republican operatives and other Clinton critics hotly anticipating the very worst.

One sign that the connection is a bit weak: The lawyers who have used the Clinton link to help publicize their cases have been

markedly vague on details.

When asked to present actual proof, Jack Scarola, the Florida attorney responsible for filing some of the most attention-grabbing
documents that have come to light in recent weeks, warned darkly in an email of “extortionate threats, power, wealth or political

pressure.”

“The time will come when all your questions will be answered,” said Scarola, who represents another trial attorney suing Epstein in

Palm Beach County Court. “But that time is not now.”

Unwilling to wait, perhaps, publications on both sides of the Atlantic have gleefully dipped into those documents to publish breathless
descriptions of Epstein’s “black book,” which contains a host of Clinton phone numbers (along with just about every other powerful
figure in the Western world); dissections of handwritten flight logs for the financier’s private 727 aircraft that frequently capture Bubba
at 30,000 feet; and extensive allegations from a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was Epstein’s sex slave as a teenager and
whose recollection places the former commander-in-chief on “Orgy Island” in 2002 to participate in a sexual romp, possibly with

women who were not yet of age.
