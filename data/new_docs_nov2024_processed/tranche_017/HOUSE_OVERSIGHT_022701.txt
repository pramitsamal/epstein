Despite what some called among the most exhaustive investigations in Palm Beach Police history — which dug up such evidence
as an Amazon receipt for Epstein’s purchase of titles including “Training With Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Exotic Slaves and

Their Owners” — there is nothing in the police record suggesting any other men were involved in Epstein’s predatory behavior.

Palm Beach County Court

The criminal case provoked numerous lawsuits from women alleging they were victims of Epstein’s proclivities, followed by secret
settlements with more than two dozen of them. One firm bringing some of those cases employed a young lawyer named Bradley
Edwards, who managed some of the cases. In 2009, a founding partner at the firm, Scott Rothstein, fled the country before
ultimately returning to plead guilty of running a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme built around recruiting investors to buy stakes in

litigation settlements that turned out to be phony.

As details of the fraud emerged, Epstein sued Rothstein and Edwards in Palm Beach County Court for racketeering, alleging,
among other things, that they dangled Bill Clinton’s association with Epstein as a lure to investors, implying that settlements would
be fast and sizable. Epstein ultimately dropped his suit in 2012, but by that time, Edwards had countersued for malicious

prosecution and abuse of process.

That case, along with a claim by Virginia Roberts against the federal government over the 2007 prosecution deal in district court
(which she filed as a “Jane Doe” in 2008), are still pending and are the source of most of the scant information about Clinton that
has appeared. Scarola, who in the past sued Chiquita over payments to violent leftist Colombian rebels and won a $1.45 billion
verdict over Morgan Stanley (that was later overturned), is the lawyer bringing the suit in county court in West Palm Beach, while
Paul Cassell, a former federal judge known for his critical take on mandatory-minimum sentences, mans the federal case four

blocks away.
Neither Cassell nor Edwards responded to requests for comment.

It is primarily from pleadings in those cases that the press has been getting a glimpse inside the lifestyle of Epstein, and, by

extension, Clinton. “Edwards had sound legal basis for believing former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable
