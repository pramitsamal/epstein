The distribution phase will rely heavily on our media and educational partners. Distribution
emanates from PPE, which attracts thousands of educators every year to its programs on
Harvard’s campus, and enrolls thousands of others in its highly successful WIDE World
courses. Previous offerings of Poetry in America courses on edX have attracted over 25,000
learners worldwide.

C: OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES

This project will eventuate in for-credit professional development materials, developed by the
Harvard Graduate School of Education to support relevant educational standards, including
but not limited to the Common Core. With funds sufficient to the task, we expect to release
two full-credit courses for teachers by Spring 2016. HGSE has a business plan to produce
these courses, which they expect will fill a market niche.

D: FUNDING OPTIONS

Funds to support Poetry in America for Middle and High School Teachers may be directed to
the Harvard Graduate School of Education. There is an HGSE account dedicated to Poetry in
America that is ready to receive donations.

Alternatively, funds can be donated to Filmmaker’s Collaborative, a 501c3 dedicated to
supporting independent film and media initiatives such as the Poetry in America project.
Filmmaker’s Collaborative provides low-cost fiscal sponsorship for over 200 media projects
across the country, and also offers professional support and public programming. Filmmakers
Collaborative allows maximum autonomy and flexibility in the use of resources to support the
objectives of the Poetry in America project.
