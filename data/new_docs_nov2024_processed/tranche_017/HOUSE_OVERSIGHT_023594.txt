US53.6bn Korean auto-callable issuance in May-17, down 21% MoM

¢ Korean issuance fell 21% MoM to US$3.6bn in May-17, which is close to the
average monthly issuance of USS3.8bn since 2014. Products issued in Oct-16
(US$3.1bn) and Nov-2016 (USS3.4bn) have knocked out recently and rolled into
new products. However, the legacy HSCEl-linked products issued in May-15 were
struck at a very high HSCEI spot level and were not able to knock-out this month.
We think issuance may pick up in July and August as ~US$4.0bn of legacy products
may knock-out in Jul-17 with an average HSCEI knock-out level of 9665 (Chart 43).

e — Issuance in KOSPI2-linked products (up from US$840mn to US$846mn) remained
steady in May-17; HSI-linked products fell 66% from US$360mn to US$120mn as
investors prefered HSCEl-linked products (which only fell from USS760mn to
USS700mpn).

e  §X5E-linked (US$1.0bn)}, KOSPI2-linked (US$846mn), HSCEl-linked (US$700mn),
and SPX-linked products (US$550mn) accounted for 86% of the May-17 issuance.
We estimate that structured product issuers are currently long US$10mn of KOSPI2
vega and USS89mn HSCEI vega respectively. The majority of the US$89mn HSCE|
outstanding vega came from the US$14bn of HSCEI-linked legacy products issued
between Apr-15 and Jul-15 that have not knocked-out.
