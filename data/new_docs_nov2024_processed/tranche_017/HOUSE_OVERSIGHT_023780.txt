34 Teaching Minds
Effective teaching, then, means teaching these things:

How to be a critic

Whom to respect and copy
How to know where you fit
How to take action

How to think

The relevant question for a teacher, then, is: Does your teaching result
in students who can do the five things listed above? There are many
ways to get those things to happen for students. These, however, typi-
cally do not include lecturing, being entertaining, giving easy grades
or easy tests, or marching students through boring exercises that teach
them the truth.

Effective teaching is made much easier, of course, if what you are
trying to teach is something worth learning. So, let’s move on to dis-
cussing that.
