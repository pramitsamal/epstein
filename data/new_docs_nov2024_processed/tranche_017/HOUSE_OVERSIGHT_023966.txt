220 Teaching Minds

we keep trying to prevent this from happening with kids. Lots of TV,
that’s the ticket.

Major learning by-doing mechanism ignored: And last but not
least, scholars from Plato to Dewey have pointed that people learn
by doing. That is how we learn. Doing. Got it? Apparently not. Very
little doing in schools. Unless you count filling in circles with number
2 pencils as doing.

Online education can change all this. Build it right once and children
the world over will have the opportunity to learn how to think and to
learn how to work. Such a system would be capable of changing fast.
Any new industry or market or technology could produce a course in
what is needed to work in that field and instantly get the people it
needed.

Schools are an ancient artifact that can’t last much longer.
