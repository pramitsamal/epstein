Some people do yoga on vacation; others go for the occasional run. This week we're thinking a little more... adventurously,
from active escapes at Travaasa Hana in Maui to racecar driving in Baja and hiking Moab with the experts at Austin-Lehman
Adventures. And after all that action, chill out with stays at the new Dream South Beach, the gorgeous Pavilions Phuket and

other luxe resorts worldwide. (Image: The Pavilions Phuket - on sale Fri, July 31.)
