EM currencies

UBS View
¢ With the risk of a Greek Eurozone exit subsiding, we think selected emerging market (EM) currencies
look attractive over the medium term against the USD and JPY and some even against the EUR.

¢ Global growth prospects remain intact, also due to recent policy easing in China, and the risk of a
broader European crisis remains contained, in our view. Over the medium term, this will likely support EM
currencies. However, further bouts of volatility remain likely in the months ahead, since negative headlines
from Europe will likely continue to weigh on investor sentiment.

¢ Our tactical and strategic recommendations list our preferred currencies. For now, we remain cautious on
the Brazilian real, Hungarian forint, Indian rupee, and Turkish lira.

A Positive scenario
¢ Macroeconomic data comes in stronger than expected and contagion risks in Europe subside further. EM
exchange rates could appreciate swiftly against G4 currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP).

& Negative scenario
¢ Global growth prospects suffer a prolonged deterioration and the European debt crisis intensifies
further. EM exchange rates could see a significant, although likely temporary, sell-off across regions.
Should growth concerns return to the fore, we expect export-oriented EM countries (e.g. most Asian
economies) to welcome currency weakness in order to cushion economic growth.

Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)

> 7% outperformance of EM FX against G4 currencies over a 6-month horizon

> 4% depreciation of EM FX across regions against USD over a 6-month horizon

What we're watching Why it matters

Inflation dynamics
in EM

Inflation dynamics are important to forecast central bank policy rate decisions.
Monetary easing typically weighs on EM currencies, while rate hikes tend to be
supportive. Key policy rate announcement dates: 29 June, Colombia; 4 July
Poland; 5 July, Malaysia; 11 July, Brazil; 12 July, Indonesia; 19 July, Turkey

European sovereign
crisis
US growth

Setbacks in sentiment will likely lead to bouts of EM currency depreciation and
elevated volatility across regions, providing attractive entry points for investors.

Growth in the US is key for risk sentiment, growth prospects in EM, and US
monetary policy decisions. Positive surprises tend to support EM currencies. Key
dates: 1 August, US ISM & FOMC rate decision
