Ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP requires affirmative votes from the holders of a majority of the shares present in person
or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote. If Carvana’s stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, the
Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment and may affirm the appointment or retain another independent accounting firm. Even if the appointment
is ratified, the Audit Committee may in the future replace Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm if it is determined that
it is in Carvana’s best interests to do so.

The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors recommend that you vote “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as
the independent registered public accounting firm of Carvana for the year ending December 31, 2019.
