I read the Control factor and it was excellent. I wish more people would realize that our country is at its most
vulnerable than ever in its history. the jihadis have basically taken over the inner cities. Islam's love for
violence coupled with ignorance and narcissim are a recipe for disaster. I hope Americans wake up in time to
save their future. I'm not optimistic though. I think its over but still I fight on.
