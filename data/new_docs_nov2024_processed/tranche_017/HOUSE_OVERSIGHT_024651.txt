m The Cannabis Plant

Cannabis is a genus of flowering plant indigenous to Eurasia. For millennia, humans have consumed
cannabis for therapeutic, medicinal, social or spiritual purposes and have used the seeds and fibrous
stalks of the cannabis plant to produce goods such as rope, paper, clothing and soap.

There are at least three principal cannabis species: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis
ruderalis.' These three species can be distinguished by their plant structures and leaves. Sativa plants are
generally tall, thin and wispy; indica plants tend to be shorter and bushier than sativa plants; and rud-
eralis plants are shaggy and the shortest of all three species. The following pictures depict the Cannabis
sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis plants and their leaves.

‘Botanists disagree about whether sativa, indica and ruderalis are distinct species or are instead distinct subspecies of a single plant
species. Some botanists propose renaming these three species to reflect their geographic origins. This report takes no position on
these botanical debates; it merely adopts one set of commonly used nomenclature.
