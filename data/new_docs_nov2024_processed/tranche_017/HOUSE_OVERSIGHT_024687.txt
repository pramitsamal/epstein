Capsules and Tinctures

Capsules are cannabis concentrates with various cannabinoid profiles encapsulated in a gelatin coating
for easy swallowing. Capsules are digested and metabolized like edibles; typically, the time from swal-
lowing to onset of an effect is one to two hours. Tinctures are concentrates suspended in an alcohol
solution and are usually placed under the tongue using a dropper; effects generally begin within 10
to 15 minutes. Capsules and tinctures are preferred over edibles by some consumers who believe they
deliver more consistent dosing than edibles.

Topicals

Topicals are any form of product infused with cannabinoids and applied topically, such as lotions,
balms, creams, lubricants and transdermal patches. Topicals often include noncannabis ingredients,
such as essential oils or herbal extracts. They are commonly used for localized relief of muscle soreness
and inflammation and for relief of headaches and cramping.
