COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019

Mary’s and Lord Jones positioned at the high-end of the competitive set. To segment
from the broad topicals market, we would note that we classified beauty creams as
products offering soothing and moisturizing characteristics (as opposed to targeted pain
relief).

- Body lotions offer more value per mg of CBD, relative to facial beauty products, with

Bath products are not surprisingly the most reasonably priced within beauty. We would
note that cosmetics are still a niche category within CBD, which is reflected in the lower
number of products and SKUs currently offered. That said, we believe the multiple sub-
categories offering CBD products will appeal to a broad range of consumer
demographics.
