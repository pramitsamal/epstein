Tilray And ABG Sign Partnership

Privately held Authentic Brands Group (ABG) recently signed a deal with Tilray to
capitalize on the general wellness capabilities of CBD. ABG’s product portfolio includes
athletic based names such as Muhammad Ali, Shaquille O’Neal, Dr. J, Nautica and Prince.
The muscle recovery and wellness capabilities of CBD create branding opportunities

products. ABG’s Nine West Brand will offer wellness products containing CBD powered
