Tilray will also gain exposure to ABG’s 150MM followers through its micro-influencer
network, Winston. Tilray will have the ability to display its name on ABG cannabis
products. Tilray will initially pay ABG $100MM and up to $250MM in cash in stock. In
return ABG will pay TLRY 49% of revenues from any cannabis products with any ABG
brand name, with a minimum of $1OMM/year for 10 years, essentially guaranteeing
TLRY will receive a return on its initial S10OMM investment. This type of deal opens the
door for CBD products to partner with IP ownership to expand brands and CBD use
partnerships.

DSW And Green Growth Brands

Green Growth Brands’ CBD infused Seventh Sense products, including foot creams and
muscle balms, will be sold at 96 DSW stores nationwide out of DSW’s 500-store base.
As the sale of CBD wellness products become widely acceptable and stigma around once
illegal products subsides, opportunity should increase to move into other nationwide
retailers. Under our coverage universe, Dick’s Sporting Goods may have the potential to
offer wellness products containing CBD. DKS has a total of 864 stores nationwide. If
DKS were to offer products in a similar percentage of stores as DSW, this would provide
166 incremental distribution points for CBD wellness products.
