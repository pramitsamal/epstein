Valuation Methodology

Cannabis: Our valuation methodology is primarily based on Relative EV-to-Sales (EV-to-Sales
divided by Sales-Growth), followed by EV-to-Sales.

Investment Risks

Cannabis: Cannabis is an emerging industry and is subject to regulatory headwinds. While
over 50% of the population is in favor of legalization, only a few states have thus far
legalized cannabis for recreational use and the product remains illegal at the federal level.
Looking forward, much work and change still needs to occur in order for this industry to
realize its full potential.

Risks Pertaining to U.S. Cannabis-Related Companies: If you are considering investing in a
U.S. company that is connected to the cannabis industry, be aware that cannabis-related
companies may be at risk of federal and/or state criminal prosecution. The Department of
Treasury has issued guidance that The Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) makes it illegal
under U.S. federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense cannabis and cannabis-related
products. Many states impose and enforce similar prohibitions. Notwithstanding the federal
ban, however, many U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized certain cannabis-
related activities.

Risks Pertaining to Canadian Cannabis-Related Companies: |n Canada, cannabis is an
emerging industry and is subject to regulatory headwinds. While medical cannabis is legal
in Canada, legislation has also been introduced to legalize adult-use sales on October 17,
2018. An initial regulatory framework has been laid out for the adult-use market, looking
ahead, the category will be subject a number of potential headwinds, including taxes and
restrictions on from factors and packaging.
