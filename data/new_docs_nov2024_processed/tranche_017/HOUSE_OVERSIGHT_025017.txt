intellectual class, almost in unison. Those death pilots may have been
zealous, but now the Americans know, and for the first time, what it
means to be at the receiving end of power.

Very few Arabs believed that the landscape all around them—the
tyrannical states, the growing poverty, the destruction of what little
grace their old cities once possessed, the war across the generations
between secular fathers and Islamist children—was the harvest of
their own history. It was easier to believe that the Americans had
willed those outcomes.

In truth, in the decade prior to 9/11, America had paid the Arab world
scant attention. We had taken a holiday from history's exertions. But
the Arabs had hung onto their belief that a willful America disposed
of their fate. The Arab regimes possessed their own sources of power—
fearsome security apparatuses, money in the oil states, official
custodians of religion who gave repression their seal of approval. But
it was more convenient to trace the trail across the ocean, to the
United States. Mohammed Atta, who led the death pilots, was a child
of the Egyptian middle class, a lawyer's son, formed by the
disappointments of Egypt and its inequities. But there was little of
him said in Egypt. The official press looked away.

There was to be no way of getting politically conscious Arabs to
accept responsibility for what had taken place on 9/11. Set aside
those steeped in conspiracy who thought that these attacks were the
work of Americans themselves, that thousands of Jews had not shown
up at work in the Twin Towers on 9/11. The pathology that mattered
was that of otherwise reasonable men and women who were glad for
America's torment. The Americans had might, but were far away.
Now the terrorism, like a magnet, drew them into Arab and Muslim
lands. Now they were near, and they would be entangled in the great
civil war raging over the course of Arab and Muslim history.
