Week in review & notable trends (Asia)

The MSCI Asia-Pac USD Index inched down 48bps in an eventful week in terms of macro
news, with equities gains offset by USD strength. Following the monetary policy
changes announced during the Bo), the Abe Cabinet approved a fiscal stimulus package
totalling ¥28.1tn last week. However, the Nikkei fell 190bps and the yen advanced
another 32bps over the week. The Korean government submitted a KRW28tn fiscal
package proposal to the Congress, which our economists believe should sustain growth
near term; the KOSPI2 was little changed (adding 35bps). The RBA cut rates by 25bps
as our economists expected, but Australian stocks declined with the ASX 200 dropping
117bps. Elsewhere in Asia, the HSI, HSCEI, TWSE and Nifty rallied 1.2%, 1.9% 1.2% and
0.5%, respectively.

Japanese equity implied volatility dropped to YTD lows
« Last week, most major Asian implied vols edged down as underlying indices rallied;
ASX 200 vol increased slightly despite the rate cut

« — NKY vol saw a larger decline, with 3M ATM vol dropping 1.1 vol pts to 21.7% mainly
due to diminished uncertainty as the fiscal package rolled out

« Most Asian skews flattened and term structures steepened, especially the Nikkei
term structure (spread between lyr and 1M ATM vols), which increased 3.0 vol pts
and turned positive

NKY Uridashi issuance continues to fall as existing ones haven’t knocked-out
Despite the falling NKY and relatively high implied volatility, Japanese Uridashi issuance
has further retraced as most existing products have not knocked-out. In Jul-16, there
was $450mn Uridashi products issued which are NKY linked. We estimate that the peak
of vega profile is around the current spot.
