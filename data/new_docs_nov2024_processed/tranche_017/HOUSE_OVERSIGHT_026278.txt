will learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire’s genesis. But given

what is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel’s activity be paused.

Those affected by Mr. Mueller’s investigation could litigate such an argument in court. One would

hope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General Rod

Mr. Rivkin and Ms. Foley practice appellate and constitutional law in Washington. He served at the

Justice Department and the White House Counsel’s Office during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush

administrations. She is a professor at Florida International University College of Law.
