GV is in inspection and going well. Not sure what renovations you mean?

On depreciation, we think we cannot use accelerated due to foreign travel preponderance, and obviously
can’t use bonus because not new. We think we are stuck with straight-line depreciation which will be
passive.

Are you saying that Jet vs. EJM could hinge on the type of plane usage? Not sure I follow that.
