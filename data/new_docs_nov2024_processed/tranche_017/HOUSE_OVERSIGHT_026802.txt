The “Americas Decades’ - The energy revolution
keeps moving forward, the implications are enormous

- The NAFTA Bloc (US, Canada, Mexico) is emerging as a new “Super Bloc” for business,
finance and energy.

- Combined, the NAFTA Bloc is comprised of more than 500 million people, a $19
trillion economy and the largest energy capability in the world. Not to mention US
and Canadian military superiority and reach globally.

- Mexican government “got it” and amended their constitution; Canada has “gotten it” for
quite some time (i.e. oil sands, Keystone Pipeline, etc.). US Congress now seeing
strategic imperative (not to mention massive federal revenues).

- The local, national, regional and broader geopolitical implications of greater
hemispheric energy independence are extraordinary and are already creating significant
policy changes — and ruptures globally (i.e. Russia, Middle East, Venezuela, China, Iran).

> Case in point: If the Ukrainian crisis has done anything, it has intensely focused Washington
(and Mexico City and Ottawa) on the need to rapidly build out natural gas and crude oil
development and export capabilities.

> And, in the near future, can tariffs and fees on overseas sales help deal with the US deficit?
There are a growing number of members of Congress who think it can. And will.
