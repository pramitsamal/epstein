ASK

Due to the funding decrease UNFPA is experiencing as the US pulled all their funding
under president Trump, and the European countries have re-directed their funding to
deal with the migrant influx, there is a funding shortfall leading to Female Condom
stock outs in countries.

The Female Health Company is looking for donors who are willing to donate money to
UNFPA, and earmark that money for purchase of the FC2 female condom only, so that
they can purchase the FC2 female condom for the following countries:

Uganda : 3 million units Ghana: 1 million units
Botswana: 1 million units Tunesia: 1 million units
Sierra Leone: 500,000 units Bolivia: 500,000 units
Tanzania: 1 million units Haiti: 500,000 units
Ethiopia: 1 million units Congo DR: 2 million units
