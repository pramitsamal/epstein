could allow a constellation of satellites to remain in the correct position relative to one another, move satellites to polar
orbit from less-expensive launch insertions or increase an orbit.

Surrey Satellite Technology's STRaND-1 also contained a couple of experimental propulsion systems. One is a re-entry
device that ejects a mixture of water and alcohol to tip the nanosat out of orbit at the end of its useful life. The other is
an array of pulsed-plasma thrusters which heat and evaporate a material to produce a charged gas to push the satellite
along.

NASA has plans to offer a $5m prize using a six-unit CubeSat for groups to demonstrate ways both to communicate
across large distances and display the effective use of unconventional propellants. Jennifer Gustetic, in charge of
NASA's prizes, says the winner will have to show that their systems are survivable and can be operated far out into
space. The programme is still at an early stage, but it could involve transporting the CubeSats for release into orbit
around the Moon. But NASA has competition. Dr Longmier believes his technology can beat NASA to the Moon without
the use of an additional spacecraft to carry the CubeSats there. And James Cutler, a satellite-propulsion expert now
also at the University of Michigan, thinks he can propel small birds even deeper into space. Let the nanosat wars begin.
