It is unfortunate that U.S. policymakers are so convinced of nuclear
obsolescence that they have difficulty understanding the motivations of
potential adversaries. It would be tragic, however, if their questionable
assumptions prevent them from recognizing the deterrence problems that
lie ahead and the grave difficulties that will be posed by adversaries, such
as North Korea, that still cling to nuclear weapons.

The Depths of Malaise in Palestine

Daniel DePetris

February 12, 2013 -- When talking about peace in Israel-Palestine, it is
easy to narrow the conversation to the leaders who are responsible for

newspapers and profiles in magazines attempting to document the two
men who are supposed to make the effort—Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud
Abbas.
