WELL, IS CULTURAL ARGUMENTATION SUFFICIENT WITHOUT GENETIC LOGIC?
FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT LANGUAGE AND RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY PER UNIT
AREA IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INTENSITY OF PARASITE SELECTION.
THE STRONGER SUCH SELECTION, THE MORE YOU ARE SELECTED TO AVOID
STRANGERS WHO MAY BE CARRYING PARASITES TO WHICH THEY ARE ADAPTED
BUT NOT YOURSELF.

IN GENERAL PETER—AS WITH HIS ILK—SEEMS OBLIVIOUS TO THE POWERFUL
EFFECTS OF CO-EVOLVING PARASITES ON HUMAN SOCIAL EVOLUITON IN THE
PAST 40,000 YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, PHONEME DIVERSITY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO
OBEY THE SAME RULE AS GENETIC DIVERSITY—AS “WE” MOVED OUT OF ARICA
IN THE LATEST WAVE ABOUT 100,000 YEARS AGO—SERIAL FOUNDER EFFECTS
REDUCED GENETIC DIVERSITY AND ALSO PHONEMIC DIVERSITY STEADILY FROM
THE COMPLEX CLICK-SOUNDS OF THE !KUNG BUSHMEN TO SOUTH AMERICAN
LANGUAGES. A VERY RECENT PAPER SHOWS THE MATTER IS MORE COMPLEX IN
AN INTERESTING WAY.

THIS IS PURE BULLSHIT

THERE IS NO UNIT OF HERITABLE CULTURAL VARIATION. THIS IS JUST A
METAPHOR. CAN YOU NAME A UNIT THAT REMAINS CONSTANT OVER AN
INDIVIDUAL’S LIFETIME AND THEN IS INHERITED UNCHANGED, ABSENT
