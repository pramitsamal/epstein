RECOMBINGATION? OF COURSE NOT. BUT THAT WOULD A TRULY DARWINIAN
SYSTEM...

INCIDENTALLY CANCER DOES EVOLVE IN US BUT IT IS A ONE-GENERATION
WONDER, BEING ONLY PASSED ON IN ONLY A COUPLE OF SPECIES OF THE DOG
FAMILY (where it has become a sexually transmitted disease). INOURSELVES IT
EVOLVES GENETICALLY IN ONE LIFETIME AND WE KNOW THE UNITS THAT ARE
SELECTED FOR. PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE AN ALMOST INFINITE VARIETY OF
CANCERS AND AS WE LEARN TO TREAT ONE, OTHERS COME TO THE FORE.

NONSENSE—THE AUTHORS ARE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT PSYCHOPATHIiC
BEHAVIOR BUT RATHER ‘AGGRESSIVE AND ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR’

TRUMP IS NOT THE PERFECT MATE BUT IS HE REALLY A ‘LOUSY FATHER’?—ASK
HIS CHILDREN, IVANKA, DONALD JR ETC—THEY SURE DON’T ACT LIKE THEY
HATE HIM. HOW ABOUT VICTIMS OF HINDU AND MUSLIM HONOR KILLINGS WHO
ARE ‘ASSASSINATED’ ‘WITH THE ASSENT OF THEIR FAMILIES’—ARE THE VICTIMS
PSYCHOPATHS OR ARE THEIR KILLERS? FOR THE EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS OF
HONOR KILLINGS—SEE BELOW. NOTE THAT CULTURAL PEOPLE HAVE OFFERED
LITTLE OR NOTHING OF VALUE ON THIS SUBJECT BUT EVOLUTINARY GENETICS
AT ONCE SUGGESTS AN INTERESTING AND VERY STRONG EFFECT.
