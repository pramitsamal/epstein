Hi.. update.. noam cannot do anything anyway.. nor UK that week.. So, I have been able confirm I can get the
ticket for the discounted amount of 4500 Euros.. Are you game with my proposal? I have until end of Sept to
buy out the old ticket before they cancel it.

Well it depends on UK.. if they can’t do it, then alas, it would be the whole thing.. I could check for a discount
ticket of course.. and maybe even economy class... There is also a small chance that I might do the event in UK
with Noam Chomsky, and I am wondering whether, if I could convince him to join me in a dialogue at your
place whether that might change the dynamics of the event for you, and free up some more money perhaps..
