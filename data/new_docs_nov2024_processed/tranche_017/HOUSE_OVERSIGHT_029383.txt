collapse from within. But the opposite
is true!

We have no intention of collapsing
from within. But this requires that we
come to our senses and act with the
right national priorities in mind for
society and the economy.

¢ The young generation, the
future, must be prioritized. And the
same applies to those groups in society
who carry its burdens:working hard,
paying taxes and serving in the IDF.
Cultivating mutual respect, openness,
tolerance, and acceptance of others;
More equitable distribution of the
national wealth; equal opportunities for
all and encouraging individuals,
groups and communities to take
responsibility. All of these are part of
our mission — and we have a long road
ahead of us.
