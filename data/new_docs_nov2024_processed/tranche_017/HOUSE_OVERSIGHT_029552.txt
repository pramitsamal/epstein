I feel like time was lost focusing on making sure it was Mr. Epstein properties when he has giving explicit

permission to promote any URL required to dislodge the negatives.

I hope this makes sense.. I haven't heard from Rich on the last invoice I sent (1/29/14) and am hoping all is

well. Do you know if he's out of the office ?

.org and foundation sites are slipping down and the USVI and science are permanently off the first page.

Thanks for you input.
