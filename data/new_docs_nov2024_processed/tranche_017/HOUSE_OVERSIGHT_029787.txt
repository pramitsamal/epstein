questions on the past and future of the
Israeli-Palestinian problem.

FP: What were your best and worst
moments in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, and what was the greatest
missed opportunity?

Saeb Erekat: Though I was not the chief
negotiator at that moment, the connection
between [then Prime Minister Yitzhak]
Rabin and President Arafat made
everyone around them, including myself,
feel that peace was possible. There was
significant progress in all tracks until
Rabin's assassination by an Israeli
terrorist -- after he was killed, no Israeli
leader had the vision to understand that
the window of opportunity for a two-state
solution would close as fast as they
continued their colonization policies.

The missed opportunity has definitely
been Israel throwing away the Arab
Peace Initiative, which offers
normalization of relations of 57 countries
with Israel in exchange for Israeli
withdrawal to the 1967 border. They
threw it away by bombing Gaza, by
intensifying collective punishments, and
by increasing settlement construction all
over the occupied West Bank,
particularly in and around Occupied East
Jerusalem.
