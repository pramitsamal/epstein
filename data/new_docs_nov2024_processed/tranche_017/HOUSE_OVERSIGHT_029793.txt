party. So let’s clear the air right now,
well before the festivities. Before we get
to the matter of coalition politics, which
is very much on our minds right now as
Netanyahu struggles to put together a
government, let us consider the other
negative part of the Peres legacy: his stint
as Defense Minister under Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin from 1974 to 1977. Today
Peres is widely respected as the architect
of the Oslo Accord of 1993, achieved
while he was Foreign Minister. It was the
first political move toward a settlement
between Israel and the Palestinians, and
Peres deserves huge credit for securing
the agreement. However, two decades
earlier, as Defense Minister, he supported
the Jewish settlement project in the
newly-conquered Palestinian territories,
both overtly and covertly. Not for
nothing did Rabin label Peres in his
memoirs as “an indefatigable intriguer.”
In 1975, while Rabin was doing his
utmost to prevent the settlement of Elon
Moreh, near Nablus, Peres continuously
sabotaged his efforts. After no less than
eight settlement attempts, which were
ruled illegal by Israel’s Supreme Court, a
“compromise” was reached, and Elon
Moreh was established five kilometers to
the east of the original site. Moreover,
during the furor over Elon Moreh,
Defense Minister Peres quietly facilitated
the creation of Ofra, near Ramallah.
