January Iran reportedly went silent about
talks. Russia, increasingly frustrated by

the inability of Tehran and the West to
negotiate seriously, vented its frustration.
“Some of our partners in the six powers
and the Iranian side cannot come to an
agreement about where to meet, Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a
news conference. We are ready to meet
at any location as soon as possible. We
believe the essence of our talks is far
more important (than the site), and we
hope that common sense will prevail and
we will stop behaving like little
children.”

According to analysts in Washington,
reinforced by comments from Iran itself,
a big reason for Tehran’s recalcitrance is
that Iran wants to prove to the United
States that its vaunted sanctions regime
will not force Iran to make unilateral
concessions at the bargaining table. In
addition, Iran is concerned that it won’t
get much in return in talks with the West,
and that it will be asked to make
unilateral concessions on uranium
enrichment without getting sanctions
relief in return. Combined with Iranian
internal divisions, as its own presidential

election season gets underway, that could
mean that for the next six months or so
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei simply won’t be
ready to talk seriously, despite scheduling
the Kazakhstan round.
