needs is the emergence of a Pakistan-like political system, where the
military controls the state at the expense of economic development,
democratization, and political stability. The collapse of Arab
autocracies and the impending conflagration in Pakistan should serve
as wake-up calls for policymakers in Washington.

Instead of indiscriminately throwing its weight around and
unconditionally cultivating ties with intransigent allies such as Israel
and Saudi Arabia, the United States should be looking toward further
cooperation with powerful and democratizing countries such as
Turkey and Egypt. Maintenance and deepening of close ties with
legitimate states with civilian governments committed to democracy
and economic development is the best way for the United States to
create islands of peace in different regions and construct durable
multilateral arrangements, which serve common interests.

Such strategic patience could also rehabilitate the battered U.S. image
around the globe. For instance, Brazil’s case is very instructive: the
rise of a democratic and progressive government, under President
Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva, ushered in a new era of stability and
economic progress. Today, Brazil is sharing the responsibilities of
hemispheric leadership with the United States and contributing to
regional stability and integration. The lesson is simple: reliance on
responsible regional powers is America’s best chance for a smooth
transition to a truly multipolar global system. Egypt can and should
be just such a partner.
