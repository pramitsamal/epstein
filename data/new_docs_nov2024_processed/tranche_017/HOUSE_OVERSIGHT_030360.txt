“Surely the fickleminded nature of the angry few will help tie up any loose ends,” the
short email concluded. “You owe me a large Scotch.”

Mr Staley, who has been heavily criticised for his attempt to unmask a whistleblower,

soon replied to the prankster in effusive terms. Presumably thinking he was talking to his
chairman, who has been dubbed “Mack the Knife” for his habit of ousting chief
executives, Mr Staley said, “You are a unique man, Mr McFarlane”.

“You came to my defense today with a courage not seen in many people. How do I thank
you?” Mr Staley wrote. The 60-year-old Barclays boss continued in the same style: “You
have a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humor with grit.
Thank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect
for your guile.”

He had time for yet more praise before he signed off. “And some day I want to see an ad lib
guitar run. You have all the fearlessness of Clapton,” said Mr Staley, referencing the
legendary guitarist Eric Clapton and his chairman’s fondness for playing his guitar in
public meetings.

The brief conversation ended with a final email around 11pm. The imposter sent a poem,
which began “Worry not of tomorrow’s end” and ended “Revel in their bloodied eyes”.
The first letter of each line spelled out the word ‘Whistleblower’.

“Thanks for sharing the foxhole,” Mr Staley replied.

The prankster, who contacted the Financial Times via Twitter, told us the email was part
of his “battle with Barclays” over a customer issue. “I thought I’d see how Jes was relaxing
after his AGM,” he said.

Barclays declined to comment.
The emails, which the FT has verified are genuine, are reproduced below.
