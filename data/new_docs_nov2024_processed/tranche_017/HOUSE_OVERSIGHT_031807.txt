| understand your frustrations and appreciate your willingness to figure out a solution. | have some ideas which | will
send you over the weekend if that is OK.

Re Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been a lot of
focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we hear from
management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger.

This morning the pricing is as follows:

Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10
Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90

Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept puts.
However | still prefer buying the Aug puts as | would fully expect more clarity from management before August expiry.
