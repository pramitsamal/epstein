Jeffery — look forward to meeting you. Wish HEE was with us. I will be in New York from Tuesday the
25th through Friday, 28 September. Let me know if you are available.

Be well.

Jeffrey - Neal

Neither of you requires introduction. I've known Jeffrey 28 years and this isn't a joke -
Donald Trump introduced us. I first met Neal in 16 years ago when Bob Pirie
introduced us ...

Neal will be visiting NYC end of month.

I think you would both enjoy spending time together -

Thanks to you both for always supporting me.

You are both copied.
