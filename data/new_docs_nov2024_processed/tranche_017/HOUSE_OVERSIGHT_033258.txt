and Al Franken:

Thank you for submitting your message to my U.S. Senate office. Each week, several thousand Minnesotans
send me their thoughts and suggestions on legislation and important issues facing our nation. This impressive
volume is a testament to the Minnesotan traditions of grassroots activism and civic participation that distinguish
our state. I closely track the concerns that are expressed in your letters and emails, and will answer them as soon
as possible.

Sincerely,

Al Franken

United States Senator
