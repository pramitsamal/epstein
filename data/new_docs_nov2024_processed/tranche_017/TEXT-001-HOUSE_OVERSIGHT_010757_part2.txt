5 A. Eleven -- A.D. 11:45 and then there's a
6 word that I can't read.
7 Q. How about a.m.?
8 A. Oh, 5:00 a.m., New York City, yes.
9 Q. Okay. Thank you, sir.
10 And the next page, where did — where did
11 your wife have opera instructions?
12 A. I have no idea. We go to the opera in
313
13 Boston, we go to the opera in New York, we go to the
14 opera in Florida. We do a lot -- a lot of opera. I
15 don't know what opera instructions means.
16 Maybe it would be best if you asked my
17 wife about these things. It's her calendar.
18 Q. I -- I intend to, sir, but --
19 A. Sure.
20 Q. -- these are calendars that you produced
21 as part of the evidence that you contend exonerates
22 you. So, I assumed that you had some knowledge of
23 the meaning of these pages.
24 A. No.
25 Q. But I may be wrong.
1 BY MR. SCAROLA:
2 Q. And you would appear in New York --
3 A. Well, no --
4 Q. — for those Court TV appearances --
5 A. I would appear --
6 Q. -- on a regular basis, correct?
7 A. I would appear wherever I was. So when I
8 was in New York, I appeared in New York, but they
9 would do it by remote when I was in a different
315
10 city. And I clearly did some remotes for Court TV.
11 Q. In fact, you took an apartment in New York
12 for purposes of convenience to facilitate your
13 New York Court TV appearances, correct?
14 A. Totally false.
15 Q. Did you have an apartment in New York
1.6 during this period of time in December of 2000?
17 A. I had an apartment for -- I've had an
18 apartment in New York for 30 -- 30 years or more.
19 But I certainly didn't take an apartment for
20 purposes of Court TV, no.
21 Q. On Tuesday, December n, the entry is
22 1:30, Jeff, correct?
23 A. Right. Yeah.
24 Q. And that's a reference to Jeffrey Epstein,
25 correct?
1 A. We have --
2 Q. So you're telling me that you don't know
3 where she was and that's --
4 A. We just -- we just gave you everything we
5 had --
6 MR. SCOTT: We provided hundreds and
7 hundreds of pages. You're picking out one.
8 BY MR. SCAROLA:
9 Q. Let's go -- let's go to the next page, if
10 we could, please, the third page in this composite.
11 A. The third, okay. Third, okay.
12 Q. And can we agree that this is a calendar
13 from December of 2000?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Can we agree it's your calendar from
16 December of 2000?
17 A. That's right, yeah.
18 Q. And can we also agree that during this
314
19 period of time, you were making regular appearances
20 in New York on Court TV?
21 MR. SCOTT: Review the document before you
22 answer the question, please.
23 A. It says 12/30, Court TV, yes. There was a
24 period of time where I had a contract with Court TV
25 and I would appear when they asked me to, yeah.

A. 1 know -- I know many, many Jeffs.
Q. Tell me which other Jeffs it might have
been a reference to --
A. I have no idea.
Q. -- on this calendar page.
A. I just have no idea. I would be
speculating.
Q. During the same period of time on
December 12 when there's a calendar entry that
reflects 1:30, Jeff, we know from the flight logs
that Jeffrey Epstein traveled on December 11 from
Palm Beach International Airport to Teterboro
Airport, which is the private plane facility that
services the New York Metropolitan area.
A. I have no idea.
You don't know?
A. No, I have no idea whether he was on that
plane. 1 haven't seen the flight log.
Q. Well, I'm calling your attention to the
flight log. It's the next page.
A. It's the next page here?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. Okay.

4 MR. SCOTT: Well, let him -- let him read
5 the exhibit.
6 A. What -- what's the date?

8 Q. December 11.
9 A. December 11. Yes, 1 see that.
10 Q. Palm Beach International Airport to

11. Teterboro?
12 A. Right, yeah.
13 Q. Passengers, Jeffrey Epstein?
14 A. Right.
15 Q. GM, a reference to Ghislaine -- excuse me,
16 Ghislaine Maxwell.
17 A. Uh-huh.
18 Q. And ET and Virginia, right?
19 A. That's what it says, yes, sir.
20 Q. And then we see three of the same four
21 passengers leaving the New York area.
22 A. Uh-huh.

Jeffrey Epstein --
A. And that Carolyn --
Q. — and Virginia were in Ncw York and you
were --
A. And that Carolyn arranged for a massage.
Q. -- having a massage.
A. And that my wife arranged for a massage.
Q. No, 1 didn't say that at all, sir?
MR. SCOTT: Well, that's what he's saying
that the record reflects.
A. The record --
MR. SCOTT: Don't cut him off.
A. -- reflects that Carolyn -- Carolyn always
wanted me to have massages because she thought it
would relax me. ldon't like massages particularly,
but when Carolyn arranged massages, almost always we
had them together at the same time. We would have
the same masseuse, sometimes a man, sometimes a
woman, come to the house and give us massages
together.
The idea that my wife would arrange for me
to have a massage with an underage girl for sexual
purposes is so bizarre and absurd as to defy any
kind of credibility, but go on.
318
1 Q. And let's look at the next page of your
2 wife's diary for December 13, the period of time
3 when the flight log shows Jeffrey Epstein and
4 Virginia in New York --
5 A. Uh-huh.
6 Q. -- at the same time when it would appear
7 that you were in New York. And at the bottom of
8 this calendar, Wednesday, December 13, A.D.,
9 massage, right?
10 A. 10:00 a.m. it says? What is it?
11 Q. It says 10, 10-A.D. massage?
12 A. Yeah.
13 Q. Okay.
14 Let's go to the next composite.
15 A. I don't have -- there's another page after
16 that. Oh, the next composite.
17 Q. Yes, sir.
18 A. Yeah.
19 Q. Composite Number 10.
20 A. Uh-huh. But -- but I just want to be
21 clear. So you're saying Carolyn was with me in
22 Ncw York during that period of time.
23 Q. No, I'm not saying that at all, sir. I
24 suggest that when we take a close look at the
25 calendar, it's going to reveal something other than

0110:55 1 Q. I would like to know why you alleged and 01:12:55 1 was your basis for this?
01:10:57 2 other minors given what you have said about your 01:12:56 2 A. All right. So the initial basis for it
01:11:01 3 knowledge of the factual basis, so to speak, for that 01:1100 3 was --
01,11:06 4 allegation. 01:1100 4 MR. SCAROLA: First of all, let me object
0111:06 5 A. Okay. There are going to be -- I'm going to 01:1102 5 because Professor Cassell is not here as an
01:11:08 6 end up giving you nine reasons, each of which is 01:13:04 6 expert witness and hypotheticals are
01:11:11 7 complicated, so I just want to -- if -- if -- I don't 01:1106 7 inappropriate. You're calling for speculation on
01:11:13 8 want to be accused of -- of filibustering or anything. 01:1108 8 his part. I'm not going to instruct him not to
01:11:15 9 I just want you to know that you have asked a broad 01:13:10 9 answer, but it is an improper question.
01:11:18 10 question that's going to require a broad and extended 01:1314 10 MR. SIMPSON: I disagree, but you can answer
01:11:20 11 answer. It -- it -- 01:13:14 11 the question.
01:11:21 12 Q. Answer the question. 01:13:14 12 THE WITNESS: Right. So the -- the factual
011122 13 A. Okay. Then I'm going to refer to a -- I have 01:13.17 13 basis would -- we are setting aside
01:11:27 14 a -- well, actually, I don't. 01:13:21 14 attorney/client communications, right?
01:11:28 15 Q. Let me ask you this: Before you refer to 01:13:21 15 BY MR. SIMPSON:
01:11:30 16 something -- 01:13:22 16 Q. I'm asking: What would you tell the judge?
01:11:30 17 A. Yeah. 01:13:2617 A. Right. So that -- I -- I -- that's
01:11:30 18 Q. -- please give me your best recollection of 01.112818 speculative to -- I don't think I can give a fair answer
01:1134 19 what the basis was, the factual basis that you had in 01:13:30 19 at this point because that would have involved going
01:11:37 20 mind. If the court said to you -- let me put it this 01:113220 back to my client and -- and carving out what kinds
01:11:40 21 way. If you went to court and Judge Marra said, 01:1136 21 of things we were going to present to Judge Marra in
01.11:43 22 Professor Cassell, what's your factual basis for this 01:13:30 22 light of the posture of the case at that point.
01:11:46 23 allegation? Tell me. What would you say? 0113,42 23 So it's a speculative question. I would
01:11:48 24 A. Right. 01:1145 24 have -- let me just -- without going into any
01:11:49 25 MS. McCAWLEY: Wait. Outside the context of 01:1348 25 attorney/client privileged communications, I would have

01:11:50 1 anything that's been communicated to you. 01:13:51 1 provided an ample factual basis for those allegations.
01:11:53 2 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. You have asked two 01:13:55 2 MR. SIMPSON: I move to strike as
01:11:55 3 different questions now, and I need to understand 01:1156 3 nonresponsive.
01:11:56 4 which question you are asking. 01:13,56 4 BY MR. SIMPSON:
01:1158 5 The question that you posed before just now 01:13:58 5 Q. Let me ask it this way: We have talked
01:12:02 6 was: What was the reason for your including 01:14'00 6 about -- somewhat about the basis for this allegation
01:12:06 7 those allegations in this pleading? 01:14.02 7 about other minors. Putting aside information as to
01.12:08 8 Now you have asked: What is the factual 01:14:09 8 which you're claiming privilege, tell me what you knew
01:12:10 9 basis? And that's going back to questions that 01:14:13 9 as of December 30th, 2014, that formed the factual basis
01:12:14 10 we have already covered, and we have, I think, 01:14:20 10 for your -- for that allegation about other minors.
01'12:17 11 exhausted the ability to respond to that question 01:14:23 11 MR. SCAROLA: And I'll instruct you not to
01:12:20 12 outside of privileged information. 01:14:25 12 answer that question for the same reason, that
01:1213 13 Do you want to go back to the question about: 01:14:27 13 when the same question was asked earlier, I
01:12:26 14 What was your reason for including those 01:14:29 14 instructed you not to answer.
01:12:28 15 allegations? 01:1411 15 MR. SIMPSON: I'm -- I'm -- maybe we are not
01:12:29 16 MR. SIMPSON: I'll ask the question a 01:14:33 16 being clear, Jack. I'm asking him to put
01:1210 17 different way. 01:14:35 17 aside -- I mean, certainly, he -- he filed a
01:12:31 18 MR. SCAROLA: Thank you. 01:14:37 18 pleading. You've asserted privilege as to
01:12:31 19 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:14:40 19 certain aspects. I'm simply asking him, putting
011213 20 Q. Mr. Cassell, I'm going to ask you: If you're 01:14:43 20 aside whatever you're claiming privilege for,
0t12:37 21 in court and Judge Marra said to you, counsel, what is 01:14:45 21 right, so I'm not -- I'm not asking you right now
0112:42 22 the factual basis for your allegation that Professor 01:14:47 22 to tell me anything you're claiming as
