0114:53 1 supports that allegation. 01:16:52 1 began, you know, I guess what we would call
01:14:55 2 A. Okay. The privileged information, obviously, 01:16:54 2 knock-and-talks, knocking on doors to try to get to some
01:14:58 3 you're asking me not to reveal at this point. 01:16:57 3 of these girls, and they would get to the girls, and
01:14:59 4 Q. I'm asking you -- I'm asking you to tell me 0116:59 4 many of them initially were -- were afraid to explain
01:75930 5 the nonprivileged information. And I'm not agreeing 0117:02 5 what had happened.
01:15:04 6 with your privilege assertion -- 0117:03 6 But as they -- as they continued talking to
01:15:04 7 A. Sure. 01:17:06 7 them, the girls began to explain that what was happening
01:15:07 8 Q. -- but for purposes of this question -- 0117:09 8 was, they were going over to Epstein's house under the
01:15:07 9 A. For purposes of this question. 01:17:13 9 guise of giving a massage, and when they got there, the
01:1507 10 Q. -- I'm accepting it. 01'1717 10 massage was, in fact, sexual activity.
01:15:07 11 A. All right. 0117:19 11 And for many of the girls, I think, as I say
0115:08 12 Q. Putting aside what you claim is privileged, I 01:17:22 12 around 23, 24, something along those lines, they were
0115:10 13 want to know everything that's the factual basis for 01:1725 13 underage. They were under the age of consent in
01:15:12 14 including the allegation about other minors. 0117:28 14 Florida.
01:15:14 15 A. Okay. Privileged information which I'm not 01.17:28 15 And so each and every one of those events was
0115'17 16 disclosing in any way would have interacted with a vast 01:17:30 16 a crime being perpetrated -- and let's be clear, not
011620 17 body of other information. 01:17:35 17 just being perpetrated by Epstein, but by other people
01:15:22 18 The vast body of other information would have 01:17.36 18 who were involved there at the mansion.
01:15:24 19 started with an 89-page police report from the Palm 01:17:38 19 And so what the -- the Palm Beach Police
0115:29 20 Beach Police Department that showed for about a 0117.40 20 Department was putting together was that this mansion in
01:15:30 21 six-month period in 2005, there was sexual abuse of 01:17:43 21 Florida was the nest of sexual abuse of young girls here
01:15:35 22 minor girls going on on a daily basis, in -- whenever 01:17-48 22 in Florida that involved, literally, in the -- in this
01:15:40 23 Jeffrey Epstein was in his Palm Beach mansion. 01:17:53 23 period of time, more than a hundred events that they
01:15:44 24 And on some cases, it was going on not once, 01:17:57 24 were able to document of sexual abuse.
01:15:48 25 not twice, but three times during the day. That -- let 0117:59 25 And when you put that together with the

01:15:51 1 me just be clear. I mean, I -- I referred to the 01:18:01 1 pattern or practice that was being revealed there, there
01:15:53 2 89-page police report. I have offered to put it into 011803 2 were hundreds of acts of sexual abuse going on in the
01:15:55 3 the record if -- if it would speed things up, but let's 01:1806 3 mansion.
01-15:58 4 just talk about some of the things that are in that 01:18:07 4 But then what becomes -- and this is where I
01:15:59 5 89-page police report. 0118:10 5 indicated that, you know, the answer would continue on.
0116:02 6 This was a -- a very intensive investigation 01:1812 6 The -- the problem was that the evidence was starting to
51:18:05 7 that the Palm Beach Police Department put together. 01:1814 7 show that this was a much broader series of events. For
011607 8 They did, for example, what are called trash covers; 011818 8 example, there were flight logs showing that Mr. Epstein
01:16:09 9 that is when trash came out of the -- of the mansion of 01:18:21 9 was then flying with underaged girls, and those flight
01:16:13 10 Epstein, the police would intercept the trash and then 0118:27 10 logs, you know, as -- as the flight logs began to
01:16.16 11 they would go through the trash and look for 01-18'29 11 develop, for example, we have seen, I know in the last
01:16:17 12 incriminating information. 0118:32 12 day or two here, one underage girl was Virginia Roberts
0116'19 13 And what they began to discover was memo 0118:35 13 who is on the flight, you know, with Epstein, and with
01,1022 14 pads -- and I say memo pads, let's be clear, pad after 01:18:39 14 Maxwell, and those sorts of things.
01:1026 15 pad after pad, or I guess I should say, sheet after 01:18:41 15 So you start to look at the flight logs and
01:16:28 16 sheet after sheet that had the name of a girl, and then 01:1643 16 you see what's going on is not just events that are
0016:33 17 there was a notation of something to the effect of a 01:18,46 17 occurring in Florida, but it's occurring on a
01:16:35 18 massage. 01:18:50 18 multi-state basis, which now starts to make it a federal
01:16:36 19 And so the Palm Beach Police Department began 01:18:53 19 crime. For example, we are seeing evidence that --
01:16:39 20 tracking down, well, wait a minute, these -- these are 01:18:56 20 let's just talk about Virginia Roberts since she's
01:16'41 21 girls giving massages and they don't seem to have any 01:1858 21 central to this case.
01:16:44 22 specialized training in massages; they don't seem to be 01,18:59 22 We are seeing Virginia Roberts being flown
01,16.47 23 masseuses in any sense of the term; what's going on 01:19:02 23 from Florida to New York where she's in the clutches of
01:1047 24 here? 01:19.07 24 Jeffrey Epstein who is sexually abusing her, you know,
01:16:50 25 And so the Palm Beach Police Department 011912 25 many times a week. And not just Jeffrey Epstein, but

01:19:15 1 other powerful persons. For example, Ghislaine Maxwell 01:21:37 1 particular girl had been sexually abused.
01:19:18 2 is there with him on all of these flights and apparently 01:21:40 2 What the Palm Beach Police Department had
01,19:21 3 being involved in the abuse. 01:21:42 3 discovered was brazen, notorious, repetitive activity
01:1924 4 Indeed -- and so you -- you have -- you 01:2146 4 sometimes occurring as often as three times in a
01:1927 5 have that. You also start to see on the flight logs, 01,21:48 5 particular day. And so that led me to believe that the
01:19:30 6 what to my mind are some very sinister things, 01:21:51 6 sexual activity that was going on in Florida was such
01:19:34 7 suggesting that the pattern is not just confined to sort 01:21:54 7 that someone who was a regular house guest there would
01:19:36 8 of, you know, the girls that are there in Florida, but 01:21:57 8 have immediately come to the conclusion that, well,
01:19:39 9 it -- it is extending more broadly. 0122:00 9 look, gee, there are these underage girls coming in here
01,19A1 10 Like one of the -- to my mind, sinister and 01:22:0310 and they -- they seem to be -- you know, they don't seem
01:1544 11 scary things on the flight logs is, we see, you know, 01:2206 11 to be here to be doing, you know, business activities;
01:19:48 12 Virginia Roberts, who we know has been sexually abused, 0122:0812 they -- they might be here doing other kinds of
01:19:51 13 and we see Jeffrey Epstein, and then we see on the 01:22:11 13 activities. So those would be the kinds of things that
01:19:54 14 flight logs one female. 0122:13 14 would -- would have formed the factual basis.
01:19:55 15 That's kind of an odd notation for a flight 01:22:17 15 There are other things as well, but I'm sure
01:19:59 16 log because, you know, typically, I understand the 0122:18 16 you want to ask other questions in addition to that. So
01:20:02 17 flight logs, the purpose is, well, if something happens 01:22:22 17 I'll stop there, but those -- that's -- I think gives
0120:04 18 with the flight, or there's some question about who was 01:22:24 18 you a small flavor of the kind of evidence that, you
01:20:05 19 on it, you want to know who -- who the person was who 01:22:28 19 know, was form -- undergirding the allegations that were
01:20:07 20 was on the flight. 01:22:32 20 being presented here.
01:20:08 21 So, to my mind, when I started to see on 01:2232 21 Q. It sounds like you quite passionately believe
01,20:10 22 these flight logs entries like one female, I viewed that 012235 22 that there was strong evidence that Mr. Epstein had
01:20:15 23 as a potential device for obscuring the fact that there 01:22:39 23 engaged in sexual misconduct; is that right?
01:20:17 24 was interstate trafficking of underage girls for 01:22:41 24 A. I think strong understates it.
01:20:19 25 purposes of sexual activity. Serious federal offenses. 01:2244 25 Q. In the course of that long answer, you didn't

01:20:22 1 But then that evidence extended, you know, 01:22:48 1 mention Professor Dershowitz's name once.
01:2026 2 more broadly than that. The evidence also started to 01:22:51 2 A. I said flight logs. And let's talk about
01:20:28 3 show, again, if we talk just about flight logs, that 01:22:53 3 flight logs.
01,20,31 4 the -- that underage girls such as Virginia Roberts were 01:22:54 4 Q. Let me back up. You didn't answer his
01:20:34 5 being flown internationally from, for example, Teterboro 01:22:57 5 name -- mention his name once; is that -- is that your
01:20:39 6 in New York to -- to locations, just to pick one, you 01:23:00 6 recollection as well?
01:20:42 7 know, for example, in London, where again sexual abuse 01:23:00 7 A. That's correct. We were talking about a
0120:45 8 was occurring. 01:23:02 8 factual basis, and I'll be glad -- I told you that there
0120:47 9 And so you started to put together this 01:23:05 9 were other things if you want, factual basis for -- for
01:20:50 10 pattern of criminality that was started in this -- you 01:23:07 10 Mr. Dershowitz. I'll be glad to add that in. Let me -.-
01:20,54 11 know, I don't know what the right word is here. I don't 01:23:10 11 let's -- let me -- let me -- I would like to supplement
012056 12 want to -- I don't want to -- you know, you've heard 01:2311 12 my answer then if I could.
01:20:58 13 discussions of hyperbole and things like that, but we 01:23:12 13 Q. Do you want to look at a document?
01:21:01 14 have got this nest of -- of -- and I won't say snakes, 01:23:14 14 A. Yes.
0121:04 15 but we have this nest of criminals in Florida, but it -- 01:23:14 15 Q. Let me first -- have we exhausted your
01:21,07 16 it seems to be spreading to Epstein's mansion in New 0123:16 16 recollection without documents of all the evidence that
01:21:10 17 York; it seems to be spreading to Ghislaine Maxwell's 01:23:21 17 you would refer to to support the allegation that
01:21:14 18 flat in London, and -- and -- and it goes on. 01:23:23 18 Professor Dershowitz abused other minors?
01:21:17 19 So those are the kinds of things that would 0123:26 19 A. No.
01:21:19 20 have formed the -- the -- the basis, particularly when 01:23:26 20 MR. SCAROLA: And let me say that you have a
01:2125 21 you -- when you start to add in this fact: What the 0123:28 21 right to refer to whatever documents you choose

01:23:43 1 we would be happy to make it available to you. 0125,38 1 Mr. Epstein saying that she had been trafficked,
01:23:45 2 MR. SIMPSON: And -- and I'll give you an 0125:41 2 sexually trafficked, you know, not just abused by
01:23:47 3 opportunity to look at that -- 01:25:44 3 Mr. Epstein, but now being forcibly sent to, you know,
01:23:47 4 THE WITNESS: Sure -- 01,25:48 4 other people to abuse.
01:23:47 5 BY MR. SIMPSON: 012649 5 And in the categories of people that were
01:23.48 6 Q. -- but I'm entitled to ask first about your 0125:52 6 sexually abusing her were academicians, and I knew that
01:23:50 7 recollection. 01:25:58 7 Mr. Dershowitz fell within that category of -- of being
01:23:51 8 A. Okay. 0126:00 8 an academician. The -- that complaint also indicated
0123:51 9 Q. Based on your recollection -- 0126:05 9 that there might be flight logs that would show that
0123:51 10 A. Right. 01:26.08 10 Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in these
0123:52 11 Q. -- I want to know all the evidence -- 0126:13 11 various locations. And that started to indicate to me
0123:52 12 A. Right. 01:2616 12 that there might be what the law refers to as a common
01:23:54 13 Q. -- you were relying on here. 01:26:19 13 scheme or plan. And that, just as Virginia Roberts was
01:23:55 14 A. So what -- what I'm going to do is, I'm going 01:2623 14 being trafficked to these powerful people in various
01:2367 15 to make a list here on my -- on my notepad of all the 01:2626 15 places, there might well be other girls.
01:23:59 16 things, and then I'm going to compare that with notes I 01:26:28 16 And so I have mentioned a flight log, and let
0124:01 17 have here. There may be a couple things that I don't 01:26:31 17 you -- you wanted to talk about Mr. Dershowitz. On .-
01:24:03 18 cover. 01:26:35 18 on December 30th, 2009, I was aware that there was a
01:24:03 19 Q. As long as your counsel is okay with that. 01:26:39 19 flight log showing Mr. Dershowitz flying with Tatiana,
0124-0420 A. Yeah. 01:26:44 20 who as far as I can tell was not a business person, was
01:24:05 21 Q. You understand you'll have to give that to 01:26:49 21 not providing financial advice or something else.
01:24:07 22 me? 01:26:51 22 I understood that Mr. Epstein was a
01:24:07 23 A. Yeah. I'll give you the notes -- 01:26:53 23 billionaire who was heavily involved in financial
01:24:07 24 Q. All right. 0126:57 24 issues. I knew that Tatiana was on a plane with
01:24:09 25 A. -- and then I will compare with what I've got 0127'01 25 Mr. Dershowitz, and then there was also, if I recall

0124:11 1 there. So I mentioned the Palm Beach Police Department 0127:01 1 correctly, working from memory as -- as you were
01:24:14 2 report. 01:27:04 2 wondering about, there was a notation that
01:24:15 3 The next thing that I want to mention is the 01:27:06 3 Mr. Dershowitz was on a plane with one female.
012419 4 Jane Doe 102 complaint. In August of 2009, Bob 0127:08 4 And so I was -- when I looked at that, I'm
01:24:27 5 Josefsberg -- who is, from what I understood, a very 0127:11 5 seeing Mr. Dershowitz on a -- on a flight with a woman
01:24:32 6 well-regarded lawyer here in Florida; in fact, a lawyer 01:2715 6 who doesn't seem to be there for, frankly anything other
01:24:33 7 that was selected by the United States Government to 01:27:18 7 than sexual purposes or something along those lines with
01:24:36 8 represent a number of the -- of the girls that had been 01:27:21 8 Mr. Epstein, with Mr. Epstein, who is a sex trafficker,
01:24,40 9 sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. He was -- he was 01:27:25 9 and with one female which seemed to me to be a potential
01'24.43 10 part of the procedure that was including the
0127:30 10 entry for disguising international sex trafficking. So
01:24:45 11 nonprosecution agreement. 01:27:33 11 that was of concern.
01:24:46 12 In August of 2009, he filed a complaint on 01:27:34 12 I then began to look at, well, I wonder, how
01:24:48 13 behalf of Virginia Roberts. That complaint indicated 0127:36 13 would I find out if Mr. Dershowitz had been abusing
01:24:54 14 that Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in 01:2739 14 other girls? Let's see. I knew that Virginia Roberts
01,24:58 15 Florida, in New York, and in -- in other places, as I 01:274215 had been forced to -- to -- to -- to do this sort of
01:25:02 16 recall. The thing that -- that I particularly recall 01:27:48 16 thing.
01,25:06 17 was that Mr. Josefsberg had said, Virginia Roberts was 01:27:56 17 MS. McCAWLEY: You're okay as long as
01:2$.12 18 abused by -- and he gave some categories of people. 01:2756 18 you're -- if you're revealing something that's in
01:2515 19 He mentioned, I think, business people. He 01:2759 19 an affidavit --
01:25:17 20 mentioned royalty, and he mentioned academicians. And 012759 20 THE WITNESS: That's right.
01:25:23 21 so to tie into your question, I knew that Professor 0127:59 21 MS. McCAWLEY: -- that she submitted, you're
01:2525 22 Dershowitz was an academician. And so what I was seeing 0127.59 22 fine.
0125:29 23 now was, that according to a very, very respected 01:28:00 23 THE WITNESS: Right. So -- so what...
01:2632 24 attorney here in Florida, he had found Virginia Roberts 0128'05 24 Let's see. What did I want, at this point --
01:25:34 25 to be credible, and had filed a lawsuit against 01:2605 25

01:28:17 6 back up to the point -- 01:29:55 6 down on this side, and take a deep breath, and

0128:32 15 exactly what I was thinking. 01:3066 15 during the course of the last two days. The only
01:28:32 16 How would we go find out whether Mr. Epstein 01:30:08 16 person who keeps jumping up is Alan Dershowitz.
01:28:35 17 was lending women, or in this case, underage 01:30:13 17 Have him pass you a note quietly, if you would,
01:28:39 18 girls, to Mr. Dershowitz for sexual purposes? 01'3016 18 please.
01:2841 19 Well, the first thing I want to do was ask -- you 01:30:18 19 MR. SIMPSON: I will disagree with your
01:2845 20 know, I'd -- I'd go ask Jeffrey Epstein. 01:30:19 20 characterization, but let me say the
01728:47 21 And so what I discovered when I started to 01:3020 21 argumentation -
01:2848 22 look at the transcripts, there were a number of 01:30:21 22 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. Are you -- are you
01:28:52 23 transcripts where Mr. Epstein was asked about 01:30:22 23 making the representation --
01:28:55 24 Alan Dershowitz. And rather than say, well, no, 01:30:22 24 MR. SIMPSON: No, I'm not.
01:28,57 25 he wasn't involved in any of these illegal 01:3023 25 MR. SCAROLA: -- that somebody on this side

012000 1 activities, Jeffrey Epstein took the Fifth as the 01:30:24 1 of the room jumped up?
01:29:03 2 phrase, you know, to be more precise. He 01:3025 2 MR. SIMPSON: No, no, no, I'm not.
01:29:05 3 exercised his right against compelled 01:3026 3 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Thank you.
01:2966 4 self-incrimination and refused to answer the 01:3026 4 MR. SIMPSON: I'm not.
01:2909 5 question, which since these were civil cases, 01:30:27 5 MR. SCAROLA: And I appreciate that.
01:29:11 6 indicated to me, since he was being represented 01:30:27 6 MR. SIMPSON: And I --
01:29:14 7 by very experienced legal counsel, that there was 01:3029 7 MR. SCAROLA: And you do acknowledge that
01:2016 8 more than an insignificant risk of incriminating 01:30:30 8 Mr. Dershowitz has repeatedly been jumping up in
01:2919 9 himself if he answered that. 01:30:33 9 the middle of testimony, correct?
01:2920 10 And so Jeffrey Epstein now had taken the 01:30:36 10 MR. SIMPSON: That's -- he just got up and
01:29:23 11 Fifth. And one of the things that I was aware of 01:30:37 11 came over to me. That's the only time I'm aware
0129:26 12 having been involved in, you know, civil 01:30:39 12 of, because I'm -- I'm looking at the witness,
01:29:28 13 litigation and criminal litigation in other 01:3041 13 but he did just do that, and I will pass notes.
01:29:30 14 cases, was that once somebody refuses to answer a 01:30:44 14 We won't get up.
01:2032 15 question like, you know: Do you know 01:30,45 15 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Well, I will tell you --
01:29:35 16 Mr. Dershowitz? And they take the Fifth on that, 01:30:45 16 MR. SIMPSON: I'm not going to take time from
01:29:38 17 that you're then entitled to draw what's called 01:3047 17 this.
0129:40 18 an adverse inference. You can -- you can infer 01:30:47 18 MR. SCAROLA: I will -- I will, for the
012042 19 that, well, if they answered that question, they 01:3049 19 record, as an officer of the court, represent
01:29:44 20 would have -- 01:30:51 20 that there have been multiple times during the

01:31:08 1 focusing on the witness, but everybody on this 01:33:11 1 review, in which he took the Fifth when asked questions
01:31:10 2 side of the room has been distracted by his 01:33:13 2 about Dershowitz.
01:31:13 3 unprofessional conduct. 01:3114 3 So, at that point, in trying to figure out,
0111:16 4 MR. SIMPSON: I'm not going to argue with 01:33,17 4 you know, whether Mr. Dershowitz was involved in
01:31:18 5 you. And I -- 01:3120 5 sexually abusing, not only Virginia Roberts, but in
01:3318 6 MR. SCAROLA: Thank you. 01:33:24 6 other girls, then you go down to the next level, next
01:31:18 7 MR. SIMPSON: -- I disagree with that 01:3126 7 layer of the criminal conspiracy.
01:31:20 8 characterization. There is another attorney 01:33:28 8 Epstein is at the top, so you go to the next
01:31:22 9 sitting between us. We will pass notes. 01:3131 9 layer. These are, you know, basically the -- the women
0111,24 10 MR. SCAROLA: Thank you. 011313 10 who, from what I could gather, were -- were older than
01:31:25 11 MR. SIMPSON: And we -- and I believe, 01:33:36 11 the age that Epstein wanted to sexually abuse. I think
01,31:29 12 Ms. McCawley, were you instructing not to answer 01,3140 12 these were 22 and 23-year-old girls, so they had, you
01:31:30 13 or what was happening? What did you -- what were 01,33:44 13 know, essentially aged out of being his sexual abuse
01:3134 14 you raising? 01:33:47 14 victims, but they continued to -- what they would do is
01:31:34 15 MS. McCAWLEY: No. There was a lot of 01:33:50 15 collect girls for him under the age of 18, that I guess
01:31:35 16 yelling going on here, so I was trying to make 01:33:5316 was in his target range.
01:31:37 17 sure that everybody was quiet -- 01:3355 17 And so what -- so the next person I wanted to
18 MR. SIMPSON: All right. 01:3358 18 talk to, you know, and get information from was Sarah
19 MS. McCAWLEY: -- so that the client could 01:34:01 19 Kellen. Sarah Kellen is on a lot of these flight logs
20 answer. 01:3404 20 with, you know, these girls that -- or women and with
21 MR. SIMPSON: All right. Let me back up. 01:34:07 21 Epstein and others, and so I wanted to talk to Sarah
22 BY MR. SIMPSON: 0114:07 22 Kellen.
01:3141 23 Q. Professor Cassell, I think you were in the 011411 23 But what I discovered there was that, when
01:31:41 24 middle of an answer? 01:3415 24 Sarah Kellen was asked about Alan Dershowitz, she took
01:31:42 25 A. i was. Yes, if I could conclude -- 01:3418 25 the Fifth, and there was -- she wasn't the only one.

01:31:43 1 MR. SIMPSON: All right. Could the court 01:34:21 1 There was Miss Mucinska, who also took the Fifth when
01:31:44 2 reporter read me the last two lines of your 01:34:25 2 asked questions about Alan Dershowitz.
01:31:46 3 answer? 01:34:27 3 And then there was Marcin -- Miss Marcinkova
01:3146 4 THE WITNESS: Okay. 01:34:30 4 who also took the Fifth. So what we -- what I had at
01,31:46 5 (Thereupon, a portion of the record was read 011433 5 this point was Jeffrey Epstein's international sex
01:31:46 6 by the reporter.) 01:34:35 6 trafficking organization. I had the next echelon, and
01:31:46 7 BY MR. SIMPSON: 0134:38 7 both the top kingpin of the sex trafficking
01:32:26 8 Q. Okay. Can you pick up then? 01,34:42 8 organization, and the next echelon had taken the Fifth,
01.32:27 9 A. Sure. I'll pick up -- pick up the -- 01:34:46 9 had refused to answer questions about Alan Dershowitz.
01:32:27 10 Q. Okay. 011449 10 And so, at -- at that point, I was drawing an
01:32:31 11 A. So I was beginning to draw an adverse 01:3451 11 adverse inference, not just from one person, but from
01:32,31 12 inference when 3effrey Epstein, who is at the heart of 01:34:54 12 four persons, and that adverse inference was being
01:32:34 13 the sexual abuse of, not only Virginia Roberts, but 01:34157 13 strengthened by the surrounding circumstances, some of
01:32:39 14 dozens and dozens and dozens of -- of girls literally 01:35.00 14 which we have already talked about.
01:32,40 15 scattered across the globe, takes the Fifth, refuses to 01:35:00 15 One of the things that -- that really
01:32:43 16 answer the question, off the top of my head, I can't 01:35:02 16 bolstered the adverse inference that I was drawing in
01:32:46 17 recall exactly, but something along lines of: Do you 0135.55 17 this case was that I've mentioned those three girls,
011148 18 know Alan Dershowitz? And he says, I take the Fifth. 01:35:09 18 Kellen, Mucinska, and Marcinkova. They were all covered
01:3260 19 That sort of, frankly, startled me, that -- that this 0115:12 19 by a nonprosecution agreement. And the nonprosecution
01,32:55 20 international sex trafficker was taking the Fifth now 01:35:15 20 agreement was highly unusual.
01:32:57 21 when asked about Mr. Dershowitz. 01:35:17 21 1 -- I had been a federal prosecutor for
01:3101 22 And so I was stymied in trying to get 01:35:18 22 about four years, I had been a federal judge for about
01,33:04 23 information from Mr. Epstein at that point. I think 01,35:21 23 five-and-a-half years, so I had seen a lot of -- of, you
011107 24 there were two depositions, if I recall correctly off 0115:23 24 know, nonprosecution types of arrangements. And one of
01:33:09 25 the top of my head, that -- that I had an opportunity to 011626 25 the things that was very unusual in this one is, it has

01:35:29 1 what I'll refer to as the blank-check immunity 01:37:40 1 that are said there, but Alessi puts Mr. Dershowitz at
01:35:33 2 provision. 01,37:46 2 the nest of this international sex trafficking
01:35:34 3 There was a provision in the nonprosecution 01:37:47 3 organization. Let's see. I think he said four or five
01:3636 4 agreement that said, this agreement will prevent federal 01:37:51 4 times a year, two or three -- you know, two or three
01:35:40 5 prosecution for international and interstate sex 01:37:55 5 days when he goes there.
01:35:43 6 trafficking, not only of Jeffrey Epstein, and not only 01:3766 6 And let's be clear, I know Mr. Dershowitz had
01:35:46 7 of the four women who were identified, but -- and this 01:37:58 7 said at some points like, I'm an attorney, and that's my
01:35:49 8 is a direct quote: Any other potential co-conspirator, 01:38:00 8 client and so forth. And Alessi said, no, but this was
01:35:53 9 close quote. 01:38:03 9 not in a -- in a lawyer/client capacity; this is in a
01:35:55 10 And so that was unusual because what it -- 01:38:09 10 friend capacity.
01:35:57 11 what it seemed to be doing was that somehow this 01:38:10 11 And so now we have Alessi putting him there
01:3568 12 agreement was quite out of the normal and had been 01,38:1212 at the same time when young girls were there. And one
01:36:00 13 designed to extend immunity to other people that might 01:38:15 13 of the -- the -- the things that I picked up, so is
01:36:04 14 have been associated with Epstein. 01:38:17 14 Alessi -- you know, is he able to figure out who these
01:36:05 15 And I knew that that category included the 01:38:19 15 girls are?
01:36:09 16 people that were involved in negotiating this highly 01:38:20 16 A photograph of Virginia Roberts is shown to
01:36:11 17 unusual provision included Mr. Dershowitz, who had been 012822 17 Juan Alessi in the deposition, and he I.D.s the
01:36:14 18 heavily involved, not only in the drafting of the 01,38:26 18 photograph as, you know, V.R., so he -- he had, you
01:36:18 19 agreement, but had also been involved remarkably in 01:38:30 19 know, put two and two together.
01:3622 20 attacking the credibility of these girls and saying 0128:30 20 So now I've got V.R. coming to the house at a
01:36:25 21 things like, you know, it was -- Epstein wasn't 0128:34 21 time when Mr. Dershowitz is also in the house, and
01:36:28 22 targeting minor girls, which just struck -- you know, I 01:38:37 22 apparently spending, you know, two to three nights there
01:36:33 23 was -- I don't want to use a technical term, 01:38:40 23 and doing this four or five times a year.
01:36:35 24 gob-smocked, that a defense attorney with an obligation 01:38:45 24 Now, Alessi wasn't the only one. There was

01:36:42 1 that Jeffrey Epstein was not targeting minor girls, when 01:3863 1 after the time period of Virginia Roberts, but it's part
01:36:44 2 the Palm Beach Police Department had collected, you 01:38:56 2 of the common scheme or plan that we've been discussing
01:3647 3 know, 23 of them that had all given essentially 01:38:59 3 here.
01:36:50 4 interlocking stories about how they had all gone over to 01:3659 4 And so in 2005, Alfredo Rodriguez says, yeah,
01:36:54 5 this house, you know, the mansion, to give a massage and 01:39:02 5 again, Mr. Dershowitz is there at a time when these
01:36:57 6 when they had gotten there, they had been sexually 01:39:05 6 massages are going on. When you start to look at Alessi
01:36:58 7 abused. 01:39:09 7 and Rodriguez's statements in context where they're --
01:3658 8 So the kingpin wouldn't talk. The next 01:39:14 8 they're saying he's there at the same time the massages
01:37:01 9 echelon of the trafficking organization wouldn't talk. 01:3616 9 are occurring, and with the West Palm Beach Police
01:37:03 10 So the next step was to say, okay, let's see if we can 01:39:19 10 Department reports showing that massages are of a sexual
01:37:06 11 find somebody, you know, lower level in there, you know, 01:39:22 11 nature, again, it started to put two and two together.
01:37:08 12 a household employee or something like that; maybe they 01:3626 12 One of the things that was particularly
01:37:10 13 will have some information about, you know, what this 01:39:30 13 important about Rodriguez's situation was that Rodriguez
0127:12 14 criminal organization is doing. 01:39:34 14 had an access to what's been called the little black
01:37:14 15 Now, let's -- let's understand, you know, 01:3938 15 book, or I think he referred to it as the holy grail.
01:37:16 16 given the pervasiveness of the -- of the criminal 01:39:40 16 This was Jeffrey Epstein's, you know, telephone book
01:37:19 17 activity, I -- I wasn't convinced that they were going 01:39:42 17 where he had telephone numbers in it.
01:3721 18 to be able to get in there and start saying exactly what 01:39:45 18 And so Rodriguez had that and, you know, I
01:3724 19 was going on because they might well be exposing 01:3648 19 guess thought that this would be worth a lot of money
01:37:26 20 themselves to criminal -- you know, criminal 01:3650 20 because it would -- you know, it would identify all of
01:3729 21 culpability. 01:3652 21 the people that have been sexually abused by -- by
01:37:30 22 But I -- I was able to read a sworn 01:3654 22 Jeffrey Epstein. And so he tried to sell it. The FBI
01:37:32 23 deposition from Juan Alessi, and Juan Alessi -- I 01:3657 23 busted him for that.
01:37:37 24 think -- I don't know. Maybe just to speed things up 01:39:58 24 And when the FBI busted him, now he's got
01:37:38 25 today, I won't go through all the things that are -- 01:40:00 25 this book. And so the book went to Alessi, and

01:40:05 1 according to a -- to a later FBI report, Alessi 01A2:32 1 a lot of money. I mean, Epstein was identified as a
01A0'.07 2 identified information that was pertinent to the FBI's 01:42:32 2 billionaire in this article, billionaire with -- with a
01A0:07 3 investigation. 01:4Z38 3 B, so the record is clear.
01:40:11 4 And so when I look at the little black book 01A2:39 4 But he said, look, if Epstein lost all his
01:40:14 5 that I have seen copies of, there are a handful of names 01:42:43 5 money -- I'm paraphrasing here -- I would be, you know,
01:40:17 6 in that black book that have been circled, apparently by 01A2.44 6 happy to walk down, you know, the Coney Island Boardwalk
01:40:22 7 Mr. Rodriguez, and one of the names that's -- that has 01:42:47 7 with him and discuss things with him, as -- you know,
01:40:25 8 been circled is Alan Dershowitz. And so that, to me, 01:42:49 8 even if he didn't have any money.
01:40:30 9 was suggesting that Mr. Rodriguez had identified, you 01A2:50 9 So now I'm seeing Dershowitz is a very close
01:40:35 10 know, Alan Dershowitz as somebody who had information 01:42:54 10 personal friend of Jeffrey Epstein. And then I started
01:40:38 11 about this -- this international sex trafficking ring. 01:42:58 11 to look at flight logs. There were -- there were some
01:40:40 12 But just as a side note, but an important 01:43:01 12 very interesting things that I noticed on the flight
01:40:42 13 note, when the -- the thing that was circled on the Alan 01:43:04 13 logs.
01:40:46 14 Dershowitz page was not a single phone number 01:43:04 14 One of the things I noticed was when I began
01A0:49 15 indicating, you know, somebody had bumped -- you know, 01:43:07 15 to, you know, get into this, that, you know, I was
01,40-51 16 Epstein had bumped into at one point. I believe there 01:43:13 16 wondering, well, what -- well, how do these flight logs
01:40:56 17 were 10 or 11 phone numbers that were associated with 01'4314 17 come into the possession of, you know, law enforcement
01:40:57 18 Mr. Dershowitz that had all been circled and an e-mail 01:43:16 18 agencies? And the answer turned out to be that they had
01:41:00 19 address as well. 01:4320 19 been provided by Epstein's defense attorney and -- and,
01:41:02 20 So that started to corroborate my sense that 01:4323 20 you know, coincidentally, I suppose, or in my mind,
01'41:05 21 Mr. Dershowitz was, indeed, a very close friend of
01:43:27 21 suspiciously, they were not provided by just any defense
01:41:10 22 Jeffrey Epstein. Now, I had then continued to do -- 01A3:30 22 attorney on this rather large defense team. They were
01:41:14 23 there's been reference today to, you know, using Google 01:43:33 23 provided by one attorney according to Detective Recarey.
01:41:16 24 to do research and so forth. So I Googled Jeffrey 01:43:36 24 Detective Recarey testified under oath that the flight
01:41:20 25 Epstein and one of the things that pops up rather 01:43:39 25 logs were provided to him by Alan Dershowitz.

01A1:22 1 rapidly is an article in Vanity Fair. 01:43:41 1 So one of the things that was -- was
01:41:25 2 And what you see in that article is, you 01:43:43 2 interesting is, Dershowitz has had access to these
01:41:28 3 know, discussion about Mr. Epstein, but when you're 01:43:45 3 flight logs, and now I'm beginning to wonder, well, has
01:41:33 4 trying to do a profile of someone, you try to figure out 01:43:48 4 there been an opportunity to sanitize those flight logs
01:41:34 5 who that person's closest friends are. 01:43:50 5 or remove any incriminating information?
01:41:35 6 And so the Vanity Fair author had gone to 01:43:52 6 And -- and one of the things that was
01:41:38 7 Alan Dershowitz, you know, our -- Mr. Dershowitz here, 01,43:54 7 interesting about the flight logs that were produced --
01:41:42 8 and had asked him, hey, what do you know about Jeffrey 01:4356 8 I believe just so the record is clear, that was Exhibit
01:41:45 9 Epstein? 01:44:02 9 1 that -- if we could -- if I could refer -- I need to
01:41:46 10 And, again, off the top of my head, you want 01A4104 10 refresh my recollection as to -- well, I don't -- you
01:41:47 11 to know what I can remember right now. What I can 01:44:07 11 may not want me to look at documents.
01:41A9 12 remember right now is that in the Vanity Fair article, 01'44:08 12 It was either Exhibit 1 or 2 this morning
0141:53 13 the -- in the Vanity Fair article, Mr. Dershowitz said, 01:44:11 13 during Dershowitz's deposition which was covering a time
01:41:59 14 I've written 20-some odd books; there's only one person 01:44:15 14 period of January to, I believe, September 2005. These
01A2:03 15 outside my immediate family with whom I share drafts, 01:44:20 15 were flight logs that were produced by Mr. Dershowitz to
0142:06 16 and that's Jeffrey Epstein. 01:44:23 16 the Palm Beach Police Department.
01.42:08 17 So I took that as indicating a -- a very 01:44:25 17 And you wonder why did they stop in
01:42:10 18 close personal association that -- you know, among the 01A4.27 18 September -- you know, why stop in September 2005?
01:42'13 19 people that -- that obviously he's sharing this -- these
01:44'31 19 What's the significance of that? Well, later on,
01A2:15 20 kinds of things that he wants evaluated before he shares 01:44'35 20 additional flight logs were obtained, and sure enough,
01:42:18 21 them with the broader world, there's his immediate 01:44:39 21 who shows up on an October 2005 flight log with Jeffrey
01:42:21 22 family and then there's -- there's Jeffrey Epstein. 01:44:45 22 Epstein? Mr. Dershowitz.
01:4223 23 There was also another similar quote in the 01:44:46 23 So that led to a suspicion that
01:42:24 24 article that indicated that -- that Mr. Dershowitz said 01:44:49 24 Mr. Dershowitz had provided to the Palm Beach Police
01:42:29 25 that he wasn't interested in Epstein just because he had 01:44:52 25 Department flight logs that, the time period of which

01:44:54 1 for the production had been carefully crafted to keep 01:46:33 1 THE WITNESS: Right. No, I mean, I want to
01:44:57 2 him out of it; in other words, to not produce the 01:48:36 2 make -- I want to make clear that there was a lot
01:4459 3 October 2005 version. 01:46:37 3 of information that I was relying on in filing
01:45:03 4 The other thing I -- I began to discover as I 01,46:40 4 this pleading, and -- and, of course, the later
01:45:05 5 started going through some flight logs, Dave Rogers, who 01:46.42 5 pleading. So we are on the subject of flight
01:45:08 6 is one of I think about three pilots that -- that 01:46:44 6 logs.
01:4610 7 Epstein regularly relied on to fly his -- you know, he 01:46:44 7 Flight logs showed that the flight logs
01:45:13 8 had very fancy -- to use the technical term -- jets. 01:4646 8 Mr. Dershowitz had produced to Detective Recarey
01:45:18 9 There were about -- there were about three pilots there. 01:46:49 9 were incomplete and inaccurate. And so that led
01:45:20 10 One of them had some flight logs and that -- 01:46:52 10 to concern on my part that Mr. Dershowitz had had
01:45:24 11 that was Pilot Dave Rogers, if I'm recalling his name 01:46:55 11 an opportunity to sanitize the flight logs,
01:45:26 12 correctly. And so later on in the litigation, the sex 01:46:57 12 had -- had -- had provided incomplete production,
01:45:30 13 abuse litigation against Epstein, flight logs were 01:47:01 13 you know, obviously, very important production
01:45:34 14 obtained from Dave Rogers, and it was possible to -- to 01:47:02 14 that the Palm Beach Police Department was looking
01'4637 15 compare -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to -- I want to make 01:47:05 15 at.
01:4640 16 sure I get -- you know, the question is: How much can -I
01:47:06 16 Then we got some additional flight logs from
01:45:42 17 remember and I'm trying to make sure I get -- get it all 01:47:09 17 Dave Rogers. And what those flight logs
01:45:44 18 in. 01:47:11 18 showed -- first off, let's talk again about
01:45:45 19 And so the flight logs were produced from 01:47:14 19 the -- the production of those flight logs.
01:45:48 20 Dave Rogers. And so Dave Rogers produced some flight 01:4717 20 My recollection is that Dave Rogers's flight
01:45:51 21 logs, and some of the flights that he produced logs for 01:4721 21 logs were provided by Bruce Reinhart who was a
01:45:56 22 coincided with the logs that Mr. Dershowitz had provided 01:47:24 22 former Assistant U.S. Attorney who had been
01:45:59 23 to the Palm Beach Police Department, and there were 0147-26 23 inside the Southern District of Florida Office at
01:46:01 24 inconsistencies. And so that, again, aroused my 01:47:29 24 a time when the Epstein case was the subject of
01:46:05 25 suspicion that maybe Mr. Dershowitz when he had -- 01:47:32 25 regular discussion in that office.

01:46:08 1 MR. SCOTT: I just got a call from a lawyer 01:47:33 1 And then he had gone to work for some kind of
01:4609 2 on the screen. His -- his phone is not working, 01:47:36 2 a -- a law firm or private operation that was
01:4610 3 Epstein's lawyer, Darren Indyke. 01:47:39 3 located adjacent to Mr. Epstein's business. And
01:46:10 4 MR. SIMPSON: Why don't -- 01:47:44 4 so, now, Reinhart, who appeared to be being paid
01:46:15 5 MR. SCAROLA: Do you want to take a break for 01:47:48 5 by Mr. Epstein, and certainly was adjacent to
01:46:17 6 a second? 01:47:49 6 Mr. Epstein's business office, was producing
01:46:17 7 MR. SIMPSON: Well, why don't -- well, why 01:4761 7 these flight logs.
01:46:17 8 don't we let him finish his answer? 01:47:52 8 So that, again, aroused suspicion that the
01:46:18 9 MR. SCAROLA: Let him finish the answer. 01:47:54 9 flight logs that were being produced would have
01:46:20 10 MR. SCOTT: Yeah, lets do that. You're 01:4757 10 been sanitized or inaccurate.
01'46:20 11 right. 01:47:58 11 But even -- I mean, you know, I think the
01:46:21 12 MR. SCAROLA: Although it may take a while. 0148:00 12 problem with -- you know, you cant sanitize
01:4621 13 THE WITNESS: It -- its, I mean, the 01:4602 13 everything. That would be too suspicious. And
01.46:21 14 question -- 01:48:04 14 so what -- what was -- was -- what was evident on
01:46:21 15 MR. SCAROLA: Yeah. But lets -- 01:4607 15 these flight logs was, for example, approximately
01,4625 16 MR. SCOTT: I don't care. 01:48:11 16 ten flights by Mr. Dershowitz with Tatiana has --
01:46:25 17 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Lets -- let's go ahead 01:48:18 17 has been discussed; with Maxwell; with Jeffrey
01:46:27 18 and finish. 01.48:21 18 Epstein. One of them had one female, which,
01:46:27 19 MR. SCOTT: Let's go ahead and finish the 01:48:25 19 again, in the context that I was looking at,
01:46:29 20 answer. We heard this much. 01.48:27 20 seemed to be a potential code word for
01:46:29 21 MR. SCAROLA: Good. Thank you. 01:48:28 21 underage -- underage girl.
01.46:29 22 THE WITNESS: Okay. So there -- 01:48:32 22 And so those flight logs showed, you know,
01:46:31 23 MR. SCOTT: I don't want to break him on a 01:48:35 23 again, close association and travel with --
01.46:32 24 roll. 01,48.40 24 with -- with -- with Mr. Dershowitz, and

01:48:51 1 Another thing that I had, and I will not 01:50:19 1 going into any confidential communications or
01748:53 2 reveal any privileged communications here or any 01:50:22 2 trying to waive in any way, I knew that David
01:48:56 3 confidential information, but on December 30th, I 01:5024 3 Boies had agreed to represent Virginia Roberts,
01:48:59 4 was aware that one of the preeminent lawyers in 01:5027 4 which gave me additional confidence in the fact
01:49:02 5 the United States, David Boies, had agreed to 01:50:30 5 that I was also representing this young woman in

01A9:15 9 MR. SIMPSON: Could I interrupt? I mean, I 01:50:46 9 immediately as -- let me just take a second and
01:49:17 10 think we are going towards a waiver here. 01:50:50 10 see if there were other things regarding
01:49:19 11 MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah. No, no, no, I do not -- 01:50:56 11 Dershowitz that -- that come immediately --
01:4920 12 MR. SIMPSON: We can't have testimony 01:51:01 12 immediately to mind.
01A9:21 13 about -- 01:51:03 13 Oh, one of the things was in the Jane Doe 102
01A921 14 MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah. 01:51:09 14 complaint, which alleged academicians that had --
01:49:22 15 MR. SIMPSON: -- this is one of the most 01:51:14 15 that had abused -- sexually abused Jane Doe 3,
01A922 16 respected people in the country, or lawyers in 01:51:19 16 there -- there were -- so that raises a question,
01:49:26 17 the country, and then you won't answer the 01:51:24 17 obviously, of who were the academicians that Bob
01:4926 18 questions -- 01,51:30 18 Josefsberg had identified?
01:49:26 19 THE WITNESS: Okay. 01:51:31 19 I can't recall, actually. Let me -- the

01:49:30 22 Boies in general -- 01:5116 22 It may have been plural, but if it's singular, I
0149:30 23 MR. SIMPSON: I agree with the description. 01:51:36 23 don't want to suggest that there were other

01:49:32 1 MR. SIMPSON: He's a distinguished lawyer. 01:51:45 1 complaint that had been filed by Bob Josefsberg.
01:49:32 2 MR. SCAROLA: And I don't think we are 01:5148 2 There were two things that were of interest
01:49:33 3 getting beyond anything that is a matter of 01:51:49 3 to that: One was that Mr. Epstein, the man that
01:49:37 4 public record. 01:51:51 4 I wasn't able to get information from because he
01:49:37 5 MR. SIMPSON: I just -- I -- 0,51:54 5 was invoking the Fifth, had refused or declined
01:49:38 6 MS. McCAWLEY: But I appreciate you -- 01:51:57 6 to file an answer to that complaint.
01:49:38 7 MR. SIMPSON: Be aware of waiver. 01:52:00 7 Rather than deny the allegations, he had,
01:49:39 8 MS. McCAWLEY: -- letting me know that. 01:5203 8 ultimately, it's my understanding -- I don't have
01:4940 9 THE WITNESS: All right. I will be -- I will 01:52,05 9 inside information and I'm not trying to waive
01:49:41 10 not waive anything, and if I start to do that, I 01:52:07 10 any information, but my understanding is that
01:49'43 11 would certainly request the opportunity to -- to 01:52:09 11 rather than answer the complaint, he settled the
0149:4512 retract what I'm doing, but I was aware -- since 01:52:11 12 case through the payment of some kind of
01:49:48 13 the issue is, well, what's in the public record, 01:52:13 13 compensation that lane Doe 102 found desirable
01:49'50 14 I was aware that, you know, probably the most 01:52:17 14 for dropping her claim.
01:49:52 15 significant United States Supreme Court case 01:5219 15 The other thing that I found interesting is
01:49:55 16 argued in the last 20 years was Bush versus Gore, 01:52:21 16 that 3osefsberg's partner, I believe it is,
01:49:58 17 which was a case that essentially determined who 01:52:25 17 Miss Ezell, had been to some of the depositions
01:50:01 18 was going to be President of the most powerful 01:5229 18 of, for example, I believe Juan Alessi and
01:50:03 19 country in the world. 01:52:33 19 Alfredo Rodriguez. And I believe at least one of
01:50:04 20 There were two attorneys who argued that case 01:5235 20 those, and perhaps both of those. And she had
01:5065 21 in front of the United States Supreme Court, and 01:52:36 21 asked questions about Alan Dershowitz in those
01:50:07 22 arguing for the Democratic Presidential 01:52:39 22 depositions, but had not asked questions about
0150:10 23 Candidate, Al Gore, was David Boies. 01:52:42 23 other academics in those depositions.
01:50:12 24 He had put his credibility on the line in 01524524 So that led me to conclude that Bob
01:5016 25 arguing the Bush versus Gore case, and without 01:52:51 25 Josefsberg and his outstanding law firm had

01:52:51 1 identified Alan Dershowitz as someone who had 02:0923 1 let me clear all of that misunderstanding up.
01:52:54 2 information relevant -- and let's be clear, that 02:0925 2 You know, that's -- frankly, if I had gotten
01,52:56 3 this is not a lawsuit about some contract dispute 020928 3 something like that, that's what I would have
01:52:58 4 or something -- that he was someone who had 02.09:29 4 said.
01:53:00 5 information relevant to the sexual abuse of 02:0030 5 The answer that came back was -- from
01:53102 6 underage girls and, indeed, they were asking 02:09:32 6 Mr. Dershowitz was something along the lines of,
01:53:05 7 questions about what information -- what 020134 7 if I remember correctly, well, tell me what
01:53:07 8 information he might have. 02:0136 8 you -- you -- tell me what you want to know and
01:53:09 9 Another -- I know, I remember now, there's a 02:09:38 9 I'll decide whether to cooperate, was I think
01:53:11 10 whole other line of things that -- that I had in 02:0041 10 the phrase that was used. And -- and so there
01:53:13 11 mind at the time, and I think since you want to 020043 11 was an attempt, you know, a 2009 attempt, a 2011
010316 12 test my memory -- I'm not -- let me be clear. 02:09:46 12 attempt to get information from Mr. Dershowitz.
01:5319 13 I'm not claiming I have a superb memory. I have 02:09:49 13 Then there was another subpoena without
01:53:21 14 an average memory, but this is a subject that's 02:09:52 14 deposition for -- for documents. You know, we
01:5322 15 very important to me, and so I've worked, you 0209:54 15 have heard a lot about records in this case that
01:53:26 16 know, very hard to get all the information. 02:09:57 16 could prove innocence. There was a records
01:53:31 17 I would like to take a break. 02:09:58 17 request to Mr. Dershowitz in 2013. And, again,
01:53:32 18 MR. SCAROLA: Sure. Take a break. 021001 18 my understanding was that there was no -- you

01:53:36 20 record, 3:27 p.m. 021007 20 And so those -- I had that information.
02:07:43 21 (Thereupon, a recess was taken.) 02:10:11 21 Another bit of information that I had was that in

02:08:14 3 that is available to support her. 02:10:31 3 out in -- in Australia, and that she would --
02:08:16 4 The next thing that I was thinking of was, 02:10:35 4 that somehow, you know, Mr. Scarola and

02.08:23 6 Mr. Dershowitz have to say about all this? So I 02:10:41 6 a telephone call that was made.
02:08:27 7 started to look at the information on that as 0210:43 7 And in that telephone call she identified
02:08:28 8 well. 02:10:46 8 Alan Dershowitz as someone who would have
02:08:29 9 In 2009, there had been a deposition request 0210;48 9 relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein and
02:08:34 10 sent to Mr. Dershowitz, and I -- I saw a document 0210:50 10 the sexual abuse of underage girls.
02:08:37 11 showing that that had actually been served on -- 02:10:53 11 And so I had that information as well. So
02:08:40 12 on him, and, you know, to the extent that what I 0211,01 12 that, as I understand, the question was: What
02:08:44 13 saw was a -- I think a receipt from the process 02:11:01 13 could I recall off the top of my head with regard

02:08:51 15 attempt to contact him in -- in 2009. 021107 15 Mr. Dershowitz with the sexual abuse of minor

02:08:55 17 contact him in 2011. Mr. Scarola had sent him a 0211.15 17 moment, is the best that I can recall for the

0211:35 3 questions, but I was going to ask the same 02:1110 3 THE WITNESS: All right. So let me -- if I
02:11:38 4 question. 02:13:11 4 could look at this to see if it -- the top
0111:39 5 MR. SCAROLA: Wonderful. We are on the same 021113 5 portion of it to see if it refreshes my

02:11:40 7 BY MR. SIMPSON: 021113 7 BY MR. SIMPSON:
02:11:41 8 Q. Mr. Cassell, you -- you mentioned that you 02.13:16 8 Q. Could I just see it for one second?
02:11:43 9 had something that you had prepared -- 02:13:18 9 A. Sure. Absolutely.
02:11:44 10 A. Yes. 02:13:21 10 Q. All right. Yeah. Let me just clarify one
0211:44 11 Q. -- that would summarize -- 02:13:27 11 point before you do that.
02:11:46 12 A. Right. 02:1127 12 A. Yes, sir.
02:11:46 13 Q. -- your knowledge. 02:1327 13 Q. In your answer, were you referring to the
0211:48 14 A. Right. 02:1128 14 evidence you could recall or the information you could
02:11:48 15 Q. And now that you have exhausted your 02:13:30 15 recall that supported your allegations as to both
32:11,51 16 recollection, could you produce that and let's just mark 02:13:34 16 Virginia Roberts and other minors, or were you treating
3211:54 17 it -- 0213:36 17 those separately?
02:11:54 18 A. Yeah, sure. 02:13:37 18 A. No, I was not treating those separately. I
0211:55 19 Q. -- as an exhibit? 02113919 was -- for me, there's a common -- what -- what the law
02:11:56 20 MR. SIMPSON: We are up to Exhibit 3, I 02:114220 refers to as a common scheme or plan in a --
0211:59 21 believe. Cassell 3. 02:13:42 21 Q. Okay.
02:12:01 22 THE WITNESS: Right. Now, there -- there are 0213:44 22 A. -- a criminal conspiracy for international
0212:01 23 two parts to this -- 02:13:46 23 trafficking that involved not just a single girl, but
02:12:02 24 MR. SIMPSON: Can we mark it first and 02:13:49 24 multiple girls. So the answer was -- was with respect

02:12:04 1 THE WITNESS: Yeah. I just want the record 02:1153 1 Q. Okay. So I may have some questions to
02:1106 2 to be clear, that I'm only looking -- there's -- 02:13:56 2 distinguish further between those two --
02:12:07 3 there's a pre-December 30th section and a 02:13:57 3 A. Yes.
02:12:10 4 post-December 30th section, so the top part is 02:1158 4 Q. -- but is it fair to say that -- and I
0/12:13 5 the -- is what I was working off of. 02,14:02 5 realize you're going to refresh your recollection, but
02:1113 6 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:14:05 6 that you had exhausted your recollection of the basis
02:12:15 7 Q. Okay. 021407 7 for the allegation in this Exhibit 2, the motion to join
0/1115 8 A. Now, underneath this is -- you know, if you 02:14:14 8 as to both Miss Roberts and other minors?
0112:18 9 have questions about what happened after December 30th. 011417 9 A. Yes.
02:12:19 10 Q. So you're -- you're prepared to produce the 02,1417 10 Q. Okay. So then, now, take a look at that and
02:12:22 11 entire document, but you're clarifying? I don't -- I 02:14:20 11 tell me if there's anything there that refreshes your
02:12:24 12 don't want to ask you -- if you're going to use it in 02:14:25 12 recollection as to something that you have not yet told
02:12:26 13 your testimony, then we will mark the whole thing. 02:14:28 13 me about.
021127 14 MR. SCAROLA: Mark the whole thing. You can 02:14:29 14 A. So this refreshes my recollection. Sarah

02:12:30 16 MR. SIMPSON: Mark the whole thing and I'll 02:14:49 16 Sarah Kellen was the first name.
02:12:30 17 ask you about it. 02:14:52 17 Nadia Marcinkova, Nadia was the first name

02:12:42 23 handed to me. It's mostly typed. It has some 02:15,11 23 litigation. He provided, for example, names of -- of
0112:44 24 handwriting on it. 02,15:15 24 some people who were involved, but he took the Fifth

021521 1 people who would have relevant information in the civil 02:1860 1 strategy to sort of stall the investigation to say:
02:15:25 2 cases, but when asked in deposition about 0218:03 2 Well, we will get you Epstein; oh, we can't meet now;
02:1629 3 Mr. Dershowitz, he took the Fifth. 02:18:03 3 oh, we will get it now -- and then -- and so forth.
02:15:31 4 So I -- I found it significant that for some 021864 4 And one of the things that I noted from all
02:15:33 5 people, he was willing to answer questions, but with 02:18:06 5 that was that Mr. Dershowitz, as Mr. Epstein's attorney,
0215:35 6 regard to Mr. Dershowitz, he took his -- he invoked his 02:18:09 6 never ultimately produced Epstein for a meeting with the
02:15:39 7 Fifth Amendment right against compelled 0218:14 7 Palm Beach Police Department, having made another offer.
02:15:41 8 self-incrimination presumably because revealing what he 021817 8 Now, obviously, something could have happened
02:15:44 9 knew about Mr. Dershowitz would, you know, cause 02:18:19 9 there. I mean, I don't -- you know, I don't know what
02:15:48 10 criminal -- criminal charges potentially to be filed 02:18:21 10 was the communications and so forth, but as an attorney
02:15:51 11 against him. 02:18:24 11 trying to get information and unable to do that, I had
021652 12 There was a common scheme or plan, and I'll 02:18:26 12 to make some reasonable inferences.
021608 13 elaborate on that in a moment, but yeah, one of -- so 02:18:29 13 And so one of the inferences I began to draw
02:16:14 14 this was another point. I mentioned that -- that there 021631 14 was that this was a stall tactic by Mr. Dershowitz, and
0216:17 15 had been three efforts to get information from 02:18734 15 in my view, potentially, an unethical one, but I
021518 16 Mr. Dershowitz by way of a 2009 deposition request, a 02:1637 16 don't -- I don't think we need to get into that in this
02:16:23 17 2011 deposition request, and further follow-up 02:18:39 17 litigation.
02:16:26 18 correspondence from counsel on that, and a 2013 document 02:18:40 18 What I saw was a stall tactic going on,
02:16:31 19 request all propounded to Mr. Dershowitz that had not 02:18:44 19 and -- and the reason I think it was a stall tactic, as
02:16:34 20 gone answered. 02:18:46 20 we are sitting here now in, what is it, October of 2015,
021635 21 Yeah, and this was -- yeah, I'm sorry, this 02:1651 21 and Mr. Epstein has never been willing to answer
0216:37 22 slipped my mind at the time -- but when -- when we saw 0218:54 22 questions about his sexual abuse of these girls.
02:164O 23 Mr. Dershowitz not responding to these answers, you 02:1868 23 And this was back in around -- what was it?
02:16:44 24 know, maybe the mail didn't get delivered to him or 02:19.01 24 I guess it would be 2005, 2006, you know, roughly a
021646 25 something like that. I don't -- I suppose that's, you 0219:04 25 decade ago, Mr. Dershowitz was offering to make Epstein

02:18:48 1 know, a theoretical possibility. 02:1607 1 available. And then that never happened, and given the
02:18:50 2 But -- but the reason I ruled out that 02:1511 2 ten-year pattern that -- that developed -- I guess I
02:1652 3 possibility, first, it didn't seem likely; but secondly, 02:1612 3 should go back. I'm sorry. Let me correct my answer.
02:16:55 4 there was a pattern of Mr. Epstein's associates evading 02:19:14 4 We should go back to December 30th, 2014. So
0216:59 5 efforts to get information from them. 02:19:17 5 there -- there appeared to be about an eight-year period
021762 6 And so let me just go back to the earliest 021621 6 of time during which Mr. Epstein had refused to answer
0217:05 7 instance of that. According to the Chief of Police in 021924 7 any questions about his sexual abuse of girls and yet,
02:17:07 8 the Palm Beach -- of the Palm Beach Police Department, 021929 8 Mr. Dershowitz said, oh, it's just a scheduling issue
02:1711 9 Mr. Dershowitz had said that he would make available 02:1630 9 and -- and we will get the Palm Beach Police Department
0217:14 10 Mr. Epstein for questions about the -- the sex, you 021633 10 to -- to, you know, to meet and -- and learn all this.
02:17:18 11 know, abuse that was going on. And, you know, 0219:37 11 The other thing that I'm -- that I'm seeing
02:17:21 12 Mr. Dershowitz had said to the Palm Beach Police 02:19:39 12 here, so now there's -- there's -- Mr. Dershowitz had
021723 13 Department, yeah, we will make him available; no, we got 02:1642 13 been involved in concealing Mr. Epstein from the Palm
0217:25 14 to reschedule it; you know, and then another time, 02:19:46 14 Beach Police Department, but there were others that had
0217:28 15 reschedule, another time. And so there were multiple -- 02:1647 15 done similar sorts of things.
02:17:32 16 according to the Chief of Police, there had been 0219:49 16 So one of them was a Ghislaine Maxwell. I
02:17:34 17 multiple, you know, requests to interview Mr. Epstein 02:19:55 17 will just call her Glenn Maxwell. I think that's kind
021738 18 and Mr. Dershowitz had repeatedly said: Oh, yeah, we 02:19:55 18 of the nickname I understand she goes by.
02:17:41 19 will schedule that, and then it hadn't happened. 02:19:59 19 So Glenn Maxwell -- remember, she is -- she
0217:43 20 Now, obviously, there could have been a 021969 20 is the one, you know, I think the record is clear, in --
82.17:45 21 situation there where, you know, an emergency had come 02:20:03 21 in -- in litigation that, you know, an allegation has
0217:47 22 up for Mr. Epstein and he wasn't able to make a schedule 02:20:06 22 been made that she was the one that -- that brought
0217:49 23 or something like that. But what I saw was a -- was a 02:20708 23 Virginia Roberts into the -- into the sex trafficking,
0217:52 24 pattern of offers to -- to meet and then withdrawals, 0220:1224 and was heavily involved with -- you know, on all the --
0217:55 25 and that seemed to me to be a deliberately calculated 0220:15 25 not all the flights, but on many of the flights with

0220:17 1 Jeffrey Epstein where -- where this seemed to be going 02:2228 I what his excuse was, but, you know, evaded the
022019 2 on and was very close to Epstein, staying at the mansion 02:22:31 2 deposition and, in fact, later information came to light
02:20:22 3 frequently. 02:2233 3 he was hiding out in, you know, in the mansion of
02:20:23 4 And so she would, obviously, be -- I guess if 02:22:35 4 Epstein while he's claiming he's unavailable for -- for
02:20:25 5 you have Epstein at the -- the top of the -- you know, 02:22:39 5 deposition.
02:20:27 6 the kingpin of the operation, Maxwell would be, you 02:22:39 6 So -- so this pattern of Mr. Dershowitz, you
0220:30 7 know, a close second or certainly at, you know, the 02:22:42 7 know, where there were three attempts to obtain
022012 8 higher echelon. 02:22:44 8 information from him, if that's all I had, I guess that
02:20:33 9 So, obviously, someone who would have, you 022246 9 would have been one thing. But what I had was a pattern
02:20:35 10 know, very significant information about, you know, the 02:2249 10 of people who were implicated in this sex trafficking
02:2018 11 sex trafficking, who were the other people that the -- 02:22:52 11 ring evading questions, you know, quite in violation of
02:20:41 12 the girls were being trafficked to, what kind of abuse 0222:57 12 court orders and depositions and things -- I shouldn't
0220:43 13 was going on, you know, what kinds of sex toys were 0222:58 13 say court order -- in violation of the deposition
0220:46 14 being used to abuse them, because I think it was in her 02:23:01 14 notices that were being sent and agreements being made,
0220:48 15 room or -- or adjacent to her room that many of these -- 0223:03 15 you know, through counsel.
02:2052 16 these devices were located, and so she would have had 02:23:05 16 And then in addition to that, I had this, so
02:20:55 17 very significant information to provide. 02:23:11 17 why -- why would you think that, you know, there's this
02:20:57 18 And so in connection with the civil cases 02:2113 18 sex trafficking, you know, ring going on? It sounds
02:21,00 19 that some of the girls had filed against Mr. Epstein, 0223:17 19 kind of farfetched.
0221:02 20 her deposition was set, in fact, by my co-counsel, 02:23:18 20 Well -- well, one of the things that I had
02:21:05 21 Mr. Edwards, and then there was some haggling over a 0223:19 21 available to me on December 30th was a photograph that
02:21:10 22 confidentiality agreement, you know, what are we 0223:22 22 was widely available on the Internet, and that
02:21:12 23 gonna -- and that had all been worked out, and then she 02:23:26 23 photograph depicted three people.
02:21:14 24 was set for a deposition and finally agreed, you know, 02:23:28 24 It depicted Glenn Maxwell, Prince Andrew, and
02:2116 25 to a deposition. 022134 25 Virginia Roberts, and the -- at the time that it looked

02:21:17 1 And just shortly, you know, I think a couple 0223:38 1 like Virginia Roberts was an underage girl. She was not
022119 2 of days before that deposition, she canceled. And well, 02:23:43 2 dressed in formal attire. And Prince Andrew had his arm
02:2023 3 she didn't cancel. Her -- her attorney called to cancel 02:23:47 3 around her, I think if memory serves, and right next --
0221:26 4 the deposition and represented that Miss Maxwell was 02:23:52 4 smiling in the background is Miss Maxwell, and it
02:21:30 5 outside the United States of America and had no plans to 02:23:54 5 appeared that that was a private residence, presumably
02:2113 6 return back to the United States. 02:2157 6 in London, close to Buckingham Palace where -- where
0221:35 7 And so, at that point, the deposition was -- 0224,00 7 Prince Andrew lived.
02:21,40 8 was not able to go forward. But it turned out that she 02:24:01 8 And so here was Prince Andrew with this
02:21:43 9 had not left the United States for an extended period of 02,24:03 9 underage girl with Glenn Maxwell, the -- the right-hand
02:21:46 10 time. She was spotted later at a wedding of a prominent 0224:05 10 girl, if that's the right expression -- I probably
02:21:49 11 person in New York. 0224:07 11 should say -- strike that -- right-hand woman of --
02:21:50 12 And so that was Maxwell fitting into this 022411 12 of -- of Mr. Epstein -- that were there and somebody had
02:21:52 13 pattern of, you know, Epstein was being told -- you 02:24:16 13 taken the photograph.
02:21:56 14 know, the Palm Beach Police Department being told by 02:24:17 14 Given the surrounding circumstances, I
02:21:57 15 Dershowitz that Epstein will answer your questions, and 022419 15 thought perhaps Mr. Epstein had taken the photograph.
02:22:00 16 then, you know, not -- not getting information, Maxwell 02:24:21 16 So that would have shown Virginia Roberts's sexual abuse
02:2203 17 evading the deposition. 02:2424 17 was not confined just to Florida, not confined to the
02:22:06 18 Jean Luc Brunel was another person who seemed 02:24:27 18 New York mansion; it would have -- it would have
02:2209 19 to be very much involved in -- in trafficking the girls, 02:24:31 19 presumably continued into London where one of, you know,
02:22:10 20 and it was the same situation. A deposition was set to 02:24:37 20 the highest, most powerful persons in the governmental
02:22:13 21 try to get answers, you know, who is involved, which 02:24.43 21 structure that -- that exists in England was now
02:22:16 22 girls are involved, what are their names, what's -- 02:2447 22 involved in -- in sexual abuse.
0222:17 23 what's going on? 022449 23 And so that created grave concern about, how
02:2216 24 And so Brunel's deposition is set and then 0224,52 24 far did this sex trafficking ring reach; what were their
02:2225 25 he -- he finagles out of it too. I don't recall exactly 022456 25 connections; what were their abilities to influence, you

00:01:10 5 That information was conveyed to us 00:03:15 5 deposition.
00:01:13 6 subsequent to Professor Dershowitz's sworn 00:03:16 6 MR. SIMPSON: Yes. And we disagree about

00:01:34 13 it is the Defendant's position that it is 00:03:31 13 just like to repeat on the record.
00:01:37 14 necessary for us to propound a new discovery 00:03:32 14 MR. SCOTT: Feel better that you got that off

00:01:50 20 you have mischaracterized Professor Dershowitz's 00:03:41 20 any testimony here today, and that I object to

0001;55 22 he made a recording. Yesterday morning, he 000147 22 subject of waiver for her attorney/client
00:01:57 23 provided that information in response to a 000348 23 privilege.

00:07:28 1 also going to follow Miss McCawley's instructions 0009:08 1 and all that goes into the advice that they were
00:07:32 2 on not answering on behalf of -- 00:09:08 2 giving her and surrounding that advice, so I
00:0712 3 MR. SCAROLA: Mr. Cassell will follow the 00:0911 3 would object to that.
00:07:36 4 instructions of Virginia Roberts' counsel. It is 00:09:12 4 MR. SCAROLA: Could I have the question read
0007:38 5 not his privilege to waive, and he is ethically 0009:15 5 back?
00,07,42 6 obliged to respect the direction coming from 00:0915 6 (Thereupon, a portion of the record was read

000752 11 MR. SIMPSON: Right. We disagree. 00:09:36 11 question, and -- and I will note for the record
00:07:53 12 MR. SCAROLA: I understand, but you can 0009:38 12 that yesterday, the witness testified that the

00:07:58 14 assume that Professor Cassell will follow my 00:09:42 14 Roberts was significant to him. So it's sort of
