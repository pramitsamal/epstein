May 19, 2008 
Dear Mr. Lefkowitz, 
I am in receipt of your e-mail dated May 19, 2008 to the United States Attorney. The U.S. 
Attorney would like me to advise you that all communications and inquiries related to the Epstein 
matter, will be handled by AUSA Marie Villafana and/or her supervisor, Karen Atkinson, so he does 
not intend to respond to your e-mail or calls unless AUSA Villafana and/or her supervisors advise 
him otherwise. Furthermore, you make reference to our July 8 deadline. Respectfully, the United 
States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (SDFL) has never agreed to any such 
deadline. Should you decide to provide the SDFL with any additional information, please do so 
through AUSA Villafana, and, in her absence, AUSA Atkinson. 
On September 24, 2007, your client, Jeffrey Epstein, in consultation with Gerald Lefcourt, 
Esq. and Lilly Ann Sanchez, Esq., as well as numerous other nationally-renowned lawyers, including 
but not limited to Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, former Independent Counsel and 
Solicitor General of the United States Kenneth Starr, just to name a few, entered into a global 
resolution of state and federal liabilities faced by your client (the Agreement) with the SDFL. 
Although you and other members of the defense team have since claimed that the Agreement was 
the product of adhesion, the following facts demonstrate that Epstein knowingly and voluntarily 
entered into the Agreement in order to avoid a federal indictment regarding his sexual conduct 
involving minor victims. Despite the fact that by signing the Agreement, Epstein gave up the right 
to object to its provisions, the SDFL bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider 
your objections. Since these objections have finally been exhausted and Epstein has previously 
expressed his intent to not comply with several of the terms and conditions of the Agreement as set 
forth below, the SDFL hereby notifies you that unless he complies with all of the terms and 
conditions of the Agreement, as modified by the United States Attorney's December 19,2007 letter 
to Ms. Sanchez by close of business on Monday, June 2, 2008, the SDFL will elect to terminate the 
Agreement.

Background 
The Agreement was the product of months of negotiations. Specifically, you requested and 
received numerous meetings, at the highest levels of the SDFL and DOJ's Child Exploitation and 
Obscenity Section (CEOS) concerning claims that (a) the investigation merely produced evidence 
of relatively innocuous sexual conduct with some minors who, unbeknownst to Epstein, 
misrepresented their ages; (b) the authorities investigating Epstein engaged in misconduct; (c) the 
contemplated federal statutes have no applicability to this matter; and (d) the federal authorities 
disregarded the fundamental policy against federal intervention with state criminal proceedings. 
After careful review, the SDFL ultimatelyrejected those claims. Subsequent to its decision, however, 
but before proceeding any further, the SDFL provided you with 30 days to appeal the decision to the 
Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Alice Fisher. As you recall, you chose to forego an 
appeal to AAG Fisher, and instead pursued a negotiated resolution which, ultimately, resulted in the 
execution of the Agreement. 
The Negotiation Phase 
During negotiations, you tried to avoid a resolution that called for incarceration and 
registration as a sexual offender — both of which would be triggered by a successful federal 
prosecution. The SDFL believed and continues to believe that should this matter proceed to trial, 
your client would be convicted of the federal statutes identified in the Agreement. In order to achieve 
a global resolution, the SDFL indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration; 
however, it remained adamant that Epstein register as a sex offender and that all victims identified 
during the investigation remain eligible for compensation. In order to achieve this result, the parties 
considered two alternatives, a plea to federal charges that limited Epstein's sentencing exposure, or, 
as suggested by you, a plea to state charges encompassing Epstein's conduct. Ultimately, the parties 
agreed to, inter alio, a plea to the state charges outlined in the Agreement, registration and a method 
of compensation. 
The Agreement 
The crux of the Agreement defers in favor of the State federal prosecution of Epstein for his 
sexual conduct involving those minor victims identified as of September 24, 2007, in exchange for 
a guilty plea to a state . offense that requires registration as a sex offender; a sufficient term of 
imprisonment; and a method of compensation for the victims such that they would be placed in the 
same position as if Epstein had been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses set forth in Title 
18, United States Code, Section 2255. Specifically, the Agreement mandates, inter alia, (1) a guilty 
plea in Palm Beach County Circuit Court to solicitation of prostitution (Fl. Stat. Section 796.07) and 
procurement of minors to engage in prostitution (Fl. Stat. Section 796.03) (an offense that requires 
him to register as a sex offender); (2) a 30-month sentence including 18 months' incarceration in 
county jail; (3) a methodology to compensate the victims identified by the United States; (4) entry 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012199

PAGE 3 OF 6 
of the guilty plea and sentence no later than October 26, 2007; and (5) the start of the above-
mentioned sentence no later than January 4, 2008. 
Furthermore, and significantly, Epstein agreed that he had the burden of ensuring compliance 
of the Agreement with the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office and the Judge of the 15th 
Judicial Circuit and that the failure to do so will be a breach of the agreement (emphasis added). 
Post-Execution of the Agreement 
Within weeks of the execution of the Agreement, you sought to delay the entry of Epstein's 
guilty plea and sentence. After the SDFL agreed to accommodate your request, counsel for Epstein 
began taking issue with the methodology of compensation, notification to the victims, and the issues 
that had been previously considered and rejected during negotiations, i.e., that the conduct does not 
require registration and the contemplated state and federal statutes have no applicability to the instant 
matter. 
A. Delay. 
The Agreement required that Epstein shall use his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and 
be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. The United States has no objection to Epstein self-
reporting to begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, 2008. Agreement, pages 4-5, 
paragraph 11 (emphasis added). After the Agreement was executed, the SDFL accommodated your 
request to extend the October 26th plea deadline to November 20th based upon, what seemed to be, 
reasonable scheduling conflict issues.' By early November, you represented that the presiding state 
courtjudge would not stagger the plea and sentencing as contemplated in the Agreement.Although 
the Agreement clearly did not contemplate a staggered plea and sentencing, the SDFL again agreed 
to accommodate Epstein's request to appear in state court for plea and sentencing on January 4, 
2008.2 
I Accordingly, I have now confirmed with Mr. Epstein's Florida counsel that the state's 
attorney's office and the court will be available to have him enter his plea on November 20. So we will 
plan to proceed on one that date. October 18;2007 email from Jay Lefkowitz to USA R. Alexander 
Acosta. 
On the same day, Mr. Lefkowitz confirmed with First Assistant Jeffrey H. Sloman that this 
postponement  will not affect when Epstein begins serving his sentence. 
2 Correspondence from Jay Lefkowitz to FAUSA Sloman dated November 8, 2007 (the judge 
has invited the parties to appear for the plea and sentencing on January 41, we do not anticipate any delay 
beyond that date.)

B. Method of Compensation and Notification. 
During this same time period, you and others, including the former Solicitor General of the 
United States Kenneth Starr, took issue with the implementation of the methodology of 
compensation (hereinafter the 2255 provision)3 and the SDFL's intention to notify the victims 
under 18 U.S.C. Section 3771 (you objected to victims being notified of time and place of Epstein' s 
state court sentencing hearing). In response, the SDFL offered, in my opinion, numerous and various 
reasonable modifications and accommodations which ultimately resulted in United States Attorney 
R. Alexander Acosta's December 19, 2007 letter to Lilly Ann Sanchez. In that letter, the United 
States Attorney tried to eliminate all concerns which, quite frankly, the SDFL was not obligated to 
address, let alone consider. He proposed the following language regarding the 2255 provision: 
Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in 
Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under 
Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein been tried federally and convicted of an 
enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall 
provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in 
an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority 
interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens 
if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these 
identified victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been 
convicted at trial. No more; no less. 
Regarding the issue of notice to the victims, USA Acosta proposed to notify them of the 
federal resolution as required by law; however, IN* will defer to the discretion of the State 
Attorney regarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings, 
although we will provide him with the information necessary to do so if he wishes. As you know, 
you rejected these proposals as well. See December 26, 2007 correspondence from Jay Lefkowitz 
to USA Acosta. 
3 Prior to any issues arising concerning the implementation of the 2255 provision, the SDFL 
unilaterally agreed to assign its responsibility to select the attorney representative for the alleged victims 
to an independent third-party. This was done to avoid even the appearance of favoritism in the selection 
of the attorney representative. As a result, on October 29, 2007, the parties executed an Addendum 
wherein it was mutually agreed that former United States District Court Judge Edward B. Davis would 
serve as the independent third-party. Judge Davis selected the venerable law firm of Podhurst and 
Josefsberg to represent the approximately 34 alleged identified victims.

C. Mr. Epstein Does Not Believe He Is Guilty Of The Federal Charges Enumerated 
Under Section 2255. 
At our December 14, 2007 meeting at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami, counsel for 
Epstein announced, inter alia, that it was a profound injustice to require Epstein to register as a 
sex offender and reiterated that no federal crime, especially 18 U.S.C. Section 2422(b), had been 
committed since the statute is only violated if a telephone or means of interstate commerce is used 
to do the persuading or inducing. This particular attack on this statute had been previously raised and 
thoroughly considered and rejected by the SDFL and CEOS prior to the execution of the Agreement. 
You also argued that the facts were inapplicable to the contemplated state statutes and that Epstein 
should not have been allowed to have been induced into the Agreement because the facts were not 
what he understood them to be. It should be noted that the SDFL has never provided you with any 
evidence supporting its investigation. This is not, and has never been, an Alford plea situation (see 
North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160 (1970)). Ultimately, you requested an 
independent review. 
Subsequent to the above-mentioned meeting, the SDFL received three letters from you and/or 
Mr. Starr which expanded on some of the themes announced in the December 14th meeting. 
Essentially, you portrayed the SDFL as trying to coercea plea to unknown allegations and incoherent 
theories. On December 17, 2007, you decreed that Epstein's conduct did not meet the requirements 
•of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution (Fl. Stat. Section 796.03) one of the enumerated 
crimes Epstein had previously agreed to plead guilty to; that Epstein's conduct does not require 
registration under Florida law; and the State Attorney's Office does not believe the conduct is 
registrable. On December 21, 2007, you rejected the USA's proposed resolution of the 2255 
provision because you strongly believe that the provable conduct of Mr. Epstein with respect to 
these individuals fails to satisfy the requisite elements of either 18 U.S.C. Section[s] 2422(b) ... or 
2423(b). In your December 26, 2007 correspondence you stated that we have reiterated in 
previous submissions that Mr. Epstein does not believe he is guilty of the federal charges enumerated 
under section 2255 and requiring Mr. Epstein to in essence admit guilt, though he believes he did 
not commit the requisite offense. 
As the SDFL has reiterated time and time again, it does not want, nor does it expect, Epstein 
to plead guilty to a charge he does not believe he committed. As a result, we obliged your request 
for an independent de novo review of the investigation and facilitated such a review at the highest 
levels of the Department of Justice. It is our understanding that that independent review is now 
complete and a determination has been made that there are no impediments to a federal prosecution 
by the SDFL.

Conclusion 
On February 25, 2008, I sent you an e-mail setting forth a timetable for moving forward in 
the event that CEOS disagreed with your position. That time is now. As you know, my February 25th 
email stated that I would give you one week to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, as modified by the USA's December 19th letter to Ms. Sanchez. In light of the upcoming 
Memorial Day weekend, I have decided to extend that timetable to the close of business on Monday, 
June 2, 2008, which is a full two weeks.

Several things have come to my attention that seem contrary to your client intending to abide 
by his obligations under the Non-Prosecution Agreement. As you know, that agreement requires our 
Office to inform you of potential breaches to give you and your client the opportunity to respond 
before an indictment is filed. At this time, I do not believe that the agreement has been breached; 
however, I have sufficient concerns that need to be addressed. 
First, I understand that private investigators working for Mr. Epstein have contacted victims 
to ask them whether any detectives or FBI agents have discussed a financial settlement with them. 
On one occasion, the private investigators told the parent of a victim that she should get an attorney 
for her daughter and she should do so right away. These actions are troublesome because the FBI 
agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution or the matter, which includes 
informing them that, as part of the resolution, that Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay damages in some 
circumstances. Furthermore, Mr. Epstein well knows that we are in the process of selecting an 
attorney to represent the victims and, but for the inordinate amount of time spent negotiating the 
Addendum, that attorney would already have been selected. Paragraph 7 of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement explicitly provides that contact with the victims shall be through that counsel. 
Accordingly, please confirm that there will be no further efforts to contact any victims until Judge 
Davis selects the attorney representative and that, thereafter, contact will be made only through that 
counsel. 
Second, the Non-Prosecution Agreement requires Mr. Epstein to use his best efforts to enter 
his guilty plea and to be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. Despite this obligation, the 
Office agreed that Mr. Epstein could postpone this deadline to November, but reiterated that Mr.

Epstein had to begin his term of incarceration not later than January 4, 2008. I have learned that the 
November hearing has been removed from the calendar and the next case disposition conference has 
not been set until January 7, 2008. This delay is unacceptable, and, pursuant to your obligations, the 
Office requests that you confer with the State Attorney's Office to try to find a date in November 
when the judge is available to conduct a simultaneous plea and sentencing, if you cannot find such 
a date, please provide documentation of your efforts to abide by the terms of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement. 
Third, there have been several press reports that Mr. Epstein no longer intends to enter a 
guilty plea. Normally I would not pay any attention to such reports, but your recent correspondence 
attempting to restrict our office from communicating with the State .Attorney's Office and the 
allusion to the imposition of sentences that clearly fall outside the terms of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreernent raises concern. Please confirm that Mr. Epstein intends to abide by his agreement to 
plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that the Court impose 
a sentence of 18 months of continuous confinement in the county jail. 
Finally, the Non-Prosecution Agreement requires that you provide the Office with copies of 
all proposed agreements with the State Attorney's Office before Mr. Epstein signs any such 
agreements. To date, no such agreements have been received. Please provide me with copies of any 
and all agreements with the State Attorney's Office for our review. The Office also would like to 
have someone present at the change ofplea and sentencing to monitorMr, Epstein's compliance with 
the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, so please keep me informed of the date, time, and 
location of the hearing. 
Please provide me with a written response, adopted by Mr. Epstein, addressing these 
concerns and reiterating Mr. Epstein's intention to comply with the tenns of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement by November 8, 2007.

6 would look like, you know, like I'm the bad person, like I'm a slut, I'm a whore or 
7 something and she's going around school saying all this stuff and then so my 
8 parents came, cause that's when I got mad at her and told her to stop talking but 
9 she wouldn't stop talking about it. So I just got in a fight with her, like a fist fight 
10 at school. And I got suspended and so did she but she only got suspended for 
11 one day because I started the fight So I got in trouble more. And my dad got 
12 really mad and he grounded me for it, because he found the $300 in my wallet 
13 and then my dad was like, you're grounded, you're grounded forever and he's all 
14 freaking out, how could you do this, blah, blah. The school said you did. And 
15 urn, I didn't tell the school how, I told them I got it from my job, cause I worked at

6 like you were taken advantage of. Not that you did anything wrong, okay? Even

8 still taken advantage of. Okay? Because you were put into a position that you 
9 felt you had no choice. Once you were there, before when you were telling me 
10 about how Jeff told you to take off your clothes? You took your pointer and you 
11 said he was really stern and you banged your leg, you put the pointer on your leg 
12 when you said that. How did you feel when he told you to take your clothes off?

8 the question, but let me just ask -- I'm going to do what 
I told you I wouldn't do; I'm going to ask it to you in 
legalese. Before going over to Mr. Epstein's house, did 
anyone try to persuade you to engage in that kind of 
sexual activity or sex with Mr. Epstein? 
A. No. 
Q. Okay. 
A. When had -- because was the 
one that had drove me over there --
Q. Right. 
A. 
told me that would be the 
one driving me -- they were following -- and had 
said that if -- he might ask if I wanted to do anything 
else, that it was up to me, I could say yes or no. She 
said, He may ask you to do other things. 
Q. But no one was asking you before you --
A. No one was telling me that I had to do 
3 
anything. She was just stating that it was a possibility 2

Q. Most importantly though, before you went 
3 over there, no one tried to persuade you to engage in any 
4 kind of sex? 
5 A. No, no one persuaded me. 
6 
Q. No one was inducing you or enticing you to 
7 do any kind of sex? 
8 
A. No. 
9 Q. 
Okay. And certainly no one that had any 
10 association with Mr. Epstein tried to persuade you or 
11 induce you to engage in any kind of sex? 
12 
A. NO. 
13 Q. Okay. As far as what said to you, 
14 she said he may ask you whether you want to do anything 
15 and it was totally within your rights to decide? 
16 A. Totally within my rights to do whatever 
17 wanted to do. 
18 Q. And I assume she told you that if anything 
19 was asked of you, whether you wanted to do anything else, 
20 I assume told you that Mr. Epstein would 
21 absolutely respect that. In other words, if you were 
22 asked to do anything and you said no, he would say, 
23 Fine. I understand. 
24 A. Yeah. Because he told me in the room if 
25 didn't want to -- whatever I didn't want to do, just say 
etdaskcisosax. * T 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012264 
no and he said that was fine. 
2 Q. Okay. 
3 A. That's what I was understanding. 
Q. Okay. But that conversation only took 
place after you got to his house, right? 
A. Yeah, right. 
Q. Okay. And going back to, to , she 
8 never communicated to you, with you by e-mail or text 
messaging about any engaging in any kind of sexual 
10 activity? 
11 A. No. It was just that day that I had 
12 decided that I was going to go over there that had 
13 took me over to 's house and then had drove 
14 me there and and followed. 
15 Q. Okay. I know the answer to this is 
16 obvious, because you only went there to Mr. Epstein's 
17 house one time, but I've got to ask you this. You never 
18 traveled anywhere with Mr. Epstein, did you? 
19 A. No. 
20 Q. You never left the state to meet with 
21 Mr. Epstein, did you? 
22 A. No. Heard other girls did. 
23 Q. Okay. Ms. Sanchez just reminded me of a 
24 question I forgot to ask. 
25 You never spoke to on the

1 telephone at any time, did you? 
2 A. No. 
3 Q. Thank you. 
4 So I think what I'm hearing you tell me is 
5 that your going over there was entirely voluntary; it was 
6 consensual on your part? 
7 
A. It was consensual on my part, yes. 
Q. No one told you that you had to dress in 
9 any particular way? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
A. No. I was wearing jeans and a tee shirt. 
Q. Kind of like today, right? 
A. Exactly. 
Q. Now, you were told that you didn't have to 
14 take your clothes off, right? 
15 A. Yeah. She was -- well, they told me it was 
16 up to me. They said that it was just going to be a 
17 massage. They didn't tell me anything further than that. 
18 They said if he did ask me, it was entirely up to me. 
19 Q. Right. 
20 A. And that was that. 
21 Q. Right. And you were told you could say no 
22 to anything if anything was asked? 
23 
A. Yes. 
24 Q. And that was clearly the atmosphere that 
25 existed when you went to the house?

4 on what your boyfriend had done to you and you wanted to 
5 get paid for this massage? 
6 A. Correct. He swiped out my bank account and 
7 I needed a way to come up with $200 that was over my 
8 bank. So I'd get paid 300. I put 200 in my bank and I 
9 believe I gave a hundred for taking me. 
10 Q. Given your debt situation, it was important 
11 to you to convince Mr. Epstein that you were over 18, 
12 because you wanted to do this job? 
13 A. Correct. 
14 Q. Gotcha. Okay. 
15 Believe it or not -- let me just check with 
16 ms, Sanchez, -- but I think I've got everything covered 
17 here. 
18 A. I don't believe it was so much Epstein as 
19 it was the girls that were working for him, that were 
20 bringing in the service, because the girls were the ones 
21 telling everybody to lie, to bring in the business so 
22 that they could get paid. I know he was traveling them 
23 back and forth and renting them rental cars. 
24 Q. So I think what you're telling me is that 
25 you really believe that Mr. Epstein was relying on what 
Q. 
Okay. And clearly, you had some debt based

3 A. For the most part, yes. I believe that --
4 I mean of course that this is what he wanted and this is 
5 what he set up. 
6 Q. Uh-huh. 
7 A. But I believe he had the girls doing all
