20 BY MR. TEIN: 
21 Q. You have no idea that Mr. Leopold filed a 
22 fifty million-dollar lawsuit on your behalf against 
23 Jeffrey Epstein? 
24 MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. 
25 Do not answer that question if it's through 
10 
1 discussions that you and I had. Outside of that, 
2 you may answer. So do not answer that question if 
3 that is the only basis by which you understand 
4 that answer. 
5 THE WITNESS: No. 
6 BY MR. TEIN: 
7 Q. You didn't know that? 
8 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't answer that question. 
9 Against, it's attorney/client privilege. Any 
10 information you've learned through conversations 
11 between you and I are protected. If you know it 
12 through any other realm, you may answer. 
13 MR. TEIN: Are you going to say that for 
Page 8 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012403 
-0929104.TXT 
14 every question in the deposition, Mr. Leopold? 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: When you ask improper 
16 questions like that without the proper --
17 MR. TEIN: You're going to stop your 
18 speaking objections right now. Okay? 
19 MR. LEOPOLD: Without the proper --
20 MR. TEIN: You need to stop your speaking 
21 objections. 
22 Let's continue. 
23 MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, you just asked me a 
24 question and I'm going to state it on the 
25 record --
11 
1 MR. TEIN: You need to stop your speaking 
2 objections. Check your rules. 
3 MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me. For the record, 
4 Counsel asked me a question. I'll state the 
5 answer on the record. He asked me the question am 
6 I going to be answering that way throughout the 
7 deposition. So long as there's improper 
8 foundation and predicate asked by the attorney, I 
9 will protect my client and I make the record where 
10 appropriate. If counsel wishes to ask an 
11 appropriate worded question with the proper 
12 foundation and predicate, I will certainly allow 
13 the client to answer the question. 
14 MR. GOLDBERGER: Why don't you just state 
15 attorney/client privilege and just be done with 
16 it. 
17 MR. LEOPOLD: I want the record to be 
Page 9 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012404 
-0929104.TXT 
18 clear. 
19 MR. TEIN: You want to waste time is what 
20 you want to do. You were supposed to be here this 
21 morning and you totally broke the deal, the 
22 agreement that you had with us if your hearing got 
23 cancelled. 
24 But let's move on and maybe you'll stop 
25 obstructing this deposition. 
12 
1 MR. LEOPOLD: I think the record is very 
2 clear where we stand thus far. 
3 Is there a recording taken of this 
4 deposition? 
5 THE COURT REPORTER: Yes. 
6 MR. LEOPOLD: Just make sure that's 
7 preserved. 
8 BY MR. TEIN: 
9 Q. Go to Exhibit 20-01 -- well, before you do 
10 that, , are you aware that a lawyer named Jeffrey 
11 Herman filed a lawsuit on your behalf, yes or no? 
12 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. 
13 Any conversations that you and I have had 
14 regarding that, if that is the only way by which 
15 you understand how to answer that question, so not 
16 answer. It's attorney/client privilege, as well 
17 as any conversations you may have had with the 
18 attorney from Miami. That is also attorney/client 
19 privilege. And I'm assuming --
20 MR. TEIN: You're actually wrong about the 
21 attorney/client privilege. 
22 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm assuming Counsel is not 
Page 10 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012405

23 asking you to divulge attorney/client --
24 MR. TEIN: Of course not.

4 MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. 
5 MR. TEIN: We've heard the objection 10 
6 times already. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, excuse me. 
8 MR. TEIN: Just say attorney/client 
9 privilege. Stop interrupting my questions. 
10 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm entitled to make an 
11 objection for the record, which I'm doing, and 
12 I'll make the same objection. And if it calls for 
13 attorney/client privilege, any conversations you 
14 and I have had, do not answer the question. 
15 And I think that it might be appropriate 
16 for the record to ask questions via 
17 as opposed to I think that would be more 
18 appropriate for this deposition. 
19 BY MR TEIN: 
20 Q. Go ahead. Please answer yes or no. 
21 la TOD 
22 Q. Thank you. 
23 In fact, you know that Mr. Herman held a

5 Q. In fact, let's go to Exhibit 20-01. 
6 MR. GOLDBERGER: Look behind you. You'll 
7 see it. 
8 BY MR. TEIN: 
9 Q. Have you ever seen that picture before? 
10 A. Yes. 
11 Q. Is that a picture of your father, your 
12 stepmother and Mr. Herman at the press conference 
13 regarding your lawsuit? 
14 A. Yes. 
15 Q. Now you know that this is a very serious 
16 matter, don't you? 
17 MR. LEOPOLD: Asked and answered. 
18 Objection. 
19 MR. GOLDBERGER: All right. You can 
20 object. You're representing a witness here, 
21 Mr. Leopold. You can object on privilege grounds. 
22 You cannot make legal objections. You have no 
23 standing to do so. 
24 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm going to make them and 
25 then --
15 
1 MR. GOLDBERGER: We're --
2 MR. LEOPOLD: We're going to leave or we're 
3 going to take a break because his demeanor is not 
4 appropriate. There's no reason to have this kind 
Page 12 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012407 
-0929104.TXT 
5 of demeanor. If you want to have this kind of 
6 demeanor with me 
7 MR. TEIN: You are obstructing this 
8 deposition. 
9 MR. GOLDBERGER: Why don't you guys go 
10 outside and just talk about --
11 MR. LEOPOLD: She -- her job is very 
12 difficult and she's not going to be able to take 
13 us both talking at he same time. 
14 MR. GOLDBERGER: Off the record. 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: We're not going off the 
16 record, Jack. We're not, Jack. Her job is very 
17 difficult. I'm going to make the record. 
18 I don't think it is appropriate, especially 
19 in the small confines of this room, to be very 
20 aggressive with this young lady. 
21 MR. TEIN: That's not happening. Stop, 
22 stop actually --
23 MR. LEOPOLD: If you're going to interrupt 
24 me, we're going to cancel this deposition --
25 MR. TEIN: Stop misrepresenting. 
16 
1 THE COURT REPORTER: I need on at a time, 
2 no matter who it is. 
3 MR. LEOPOLD: I think we're going to take a 
4 break. Perhaps you might want to talk to your 
5 co-counsel --
6 MR. TEIN: I don't need to talk to him. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: But we're going to take a 
8 break. 
Page 13

9 MR. TEIN: Not taking a break unless the 
10 witness needs a break. 
11 You're obstructing this deposition, Ted. 
12 MR. LEOPOLD: Come on, 
13 You all want to continue in this 
14 demeanor --
15 MR. TEIN: You're obstructing the 
16 deposition. Stop making speeches. We're not 
17 discussing this with you. The questions are to 
18 your client. Go take your five-minute break. 
19 MR. LEOPOLD: Fine. We need to make sure 
20 the record's clear and clean. 
21 And I want to make sure as I've already 
22 asked you -- I know that you're one of the best in 
23 town -- that this audio -- this needs to be 
24 preserved. Okay? 
25 MR. TEIN: Go take your five-minute break, 
17 
1 Mr. Leopold, now. 
2 You were supposed to be here at nine a.m.; 
3 it's now after two. Take your break and come

8 MR. LEOPOLD: It is an objection. 
9 MR. TEIN: Then terminate the deposition if 
10 you think it's been asked and answered. 
11 MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, I am not precluded 
12 from just making an objection to the form of the 
13 question. As the courts well know, and if you 
14 practice here in West Palm Beach, many of the 
15 judges require you to set the objection with 
16 specificity. And I will do that. And if you 
17 don't want me to, you can make the record. But I 
18 will do that. 
19 MR. TEIN: Here's what we'll do, Ted. You 
20 can -- I will allow you to reserve an objection to 
21 form for every single one of my questions. 
22 Otherwise, all you're doing is obstructing.

4 BY MR. TEIN: 
5 Q. 
6 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm going to make the record. 
7 You cannot interrupt me when I'm making the 
8 record. Out of professional conduct, you cannot 
9 do that. I'm entitled to make the record. I made 
10 an objection, asked and answered. You demeanor is 
11 inappropriate. You're willing and you are able 
12 and you're responsible to ask a question in a 
13 professional manner and ask the question and once 
14 you get the answer, to either follow up on it or 
15 move on, but not continuously browbeat and ask the 
16 same question over and over because you don't like 
17 the answer. 
18 MR. TEIN: Calm down, sir. 
19 MR. LEOPOLD: Trust me, I'm very calm here. 
20 When I'm not calm you'll know it. I'm very calm. 
21 So please continue on, but I will not allow 
22 you to continue to harass her in the demeanor that 
23 you're doing. Ask her a question and move on. 
24 MR. TEIN: Are you done? 
25 MR. LEOPOLD: Thank you. I am.

3 Stop it. 
4 BY MR. TEIN: 
5 Q. 
6 MR. LEOPOLD: I think the record is very 
7 clear. 
8 MR. GOLDBERGER: Let me just clarify 
9 something. When you object to the form of a 
10 question, you're not instructing the witness not 
11 to answer the question, are you? 
12 MR. LEOPOLD: No. And I'm not making that 
13 objection: only on attorney/client privilege. 
14 MR. TEIN: Will you stop speaking now so I 
15 can ask my question? Are you done? 
16 Okay. I'm going to ask my question. 
17 BY MR. TEIN: 
18 Q. Listen, 
19 MR. LEOPOLD: Hold on. Stop. 
20 I've been doing this for 20 plus years and 
21 have met a lot of attorneys, but I've never had an 
22 experience like this where I've --
23 MR. TEIN: Stop your speeches. 
24 MR. LEOPOLD: If you continue to do this, 
25 whether its with me or with my client, I will not 
29 
1 put up with it and I don't need to put up with it 
2 and it's not appropriate. And I'm sure Mr. 
3 Goldberger knows all this, because I know that he 
4 wouldn't do this. So I will not put up with it.

24 Q. Now, Saige, you lied to get out of this 
25 deposition, didn't you? 
54 
1 A. No, sir. 
2 Q. You didn't want to come to court today and 
3 tell the story that you had told to the police under 
4 oath, did you? 
5 MR. LEOPOLD: Object to the form of the 
6 question. Lack of foundation, predicate. 
7 THE WITNESS: No. I have no problem coming 
8 here and talking to you. 
9 BY MR. TEIN: 
10 Q. And to avoid getting served with a lawful 
11 subpoena, you lied about your name, didn't you? 
12 A. No. 
13 Q. And in fact, just lying yourself wasn't 
14 enough, was it?

2 BY MR. TEIN: 
3 Q. You asked your co-workers 
4 MR. LEOPOLD: It's vague and ambiguous. 
5 BY MR. TEIN: 
6 Q. You asked your co-workers at the 
7 to lie for you, didn't you? 
8 A. No. I informed my boss about what was 
9 going on and he told me that he would help in any way 
10 that he can. 
11 Q. Okay. You got your friend to lie 
12 by switching name tags with you, correct? 
13 A. Incorrect. It was a coincidence that same 
14 night she was not wearing her name tag; she was wearing 
15 mine. But I was also not wearing -- I was wearing my 
16 name tag. Everyone switches name tags. It just so 
17 happens it was a coincidence that same night the people 
18 came with the papers. 
19 MR. TEIN: Will you put up Exhibit 18-001? 
20 MR. GOLDBERGER: And mark 18-001 for 
21 identification purposes to this deposition. 
22 MR. LEOPOLD: None of them have been marked 
23 yet. Can we mark them and put them as attachment 
24 to the depositions? Because I think you've shown 
25 three photos now. And this is the only one that 
Page 47

56 
1 has been marked for identification yet. 
2 BY MR. TEIN: 
3 Q. 
4 MR. LEOPOLD: Hold on just a second. Just 
5 so the record is clear --
6 MR. TEIN: I'm not speaking to you. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. Then don't speak to me 
8 then. But I'll speak to Mr. Goldberger, perhaps. 
9 But at least for the record, can we put on 
10 the record what the previous two photographs were 
11 marked for identification? 
12 MR. GOLDBERGER: We will make sure that the 
13 record is clear at the end of the deposition so 
14 that there's no ambiguity. 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: Thank you. 
16 BY MR. TEIN: 
17 Q. I've put a photograph marked 18-001

A. Total honesty.

going to be served with a subpoena, correct?

8 counsel stopped you from explaining. 
Page 49 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012444 
-0929104.TXT 
9 A. Okay. I work at and people 
10 were telling me that people were looking for me. So yes, 
11 I was aware that people were searching for me, but I had 
12 no idea who they were or what their intentions were, but 
13 I thought they were just people I didn't want to talk to. 
14 So I just didn't want to talk to them. And every time 
15 they'd come to work I wasn't there. And so happens the 
16 night that they came in me and my friend switched name 
17 tags. No big deal. 
18 Q. That's a lie, isn't it? 
19 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Don't answer that 
20 question. That's harassment and I will not allow 
21 it. He could ask the questions and we'll allow a 
22 jury to make that determination, but not counsel. 
23 I will not allow her to answer that 
24 question. 
25 MR. TEIN: Certify it. 
59 
1 MR. LEOPOLD: I'll certify it. 
2 ..................CERTIFIED QUESTION.................. 
3 She's answered that question. She's explained it five 
4 times already. The fact that Counsel doesn't like the 
5 answer, that's a different query. 
6 MR. TEIN: Stop making speaking objections. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not. I'm not going to 
8 put up with it, because it's in appropriate, Jack, 
9 and you know it. I will not allow Counsel to 
10 berate a witness, whether it's in a criminal case 
11 or a civil case, whether my client or 
12 MR. TEIN: Calm down. 
13 MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me. 
Page 50 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012445 
-0929104.TXT 
14 No, I'm not going to allow it. That is not 
15 proper. 
16 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. 
17 MR. LEOPOLD: If he wants to say that she's 
18 lying after asking it five times and her 
19 explaining in great detail, he can do that. But 
20 I'm not going to allow her to answer, nor be 
21 harassed by him. It's improper. 
22 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. But your response 
23 that Counsel doesn't like the question -- or 
24 doesn't like the answer -- just let me finish. 
25 MR. LEOPOLD: Absolutely. I wasn't going 
60 
1 to interrupt you. 
2 MR. GOLDBERGER: Just requires us to say we 
3 like the answer to that question. And it's not 
4 you and t or you and Mr. Tein who are testifying 
5 here. It's the witness. 
6 MR. LEOPOLD: Fine. But after the sixth 
7 time of asking the same question and then coming 
8 back and pointing a finger at her and saying, 
9 you're a liar --
10 MR. TEIN: That didn't happen. 
11 MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. But I'm not 
12 going to allow her to answer that question because 
13 she's answered that same question and has 
14 explained it. 
15 Now Counsel might be sitting there rubbing 
16 his head with a migraine. That's his problem. 
17 But if he can't ask a question appropriately in a 
Page 51 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012446 
-0929104.TXT 
18 professional manner, we will leave. I will not 
19 allow her to be berated like that. 
20 MR. GOLDBERGER: Actually, we're very happy 
21 with the answer. 
22 MR. LEOPOLD: That's great. 
23 MR. GOLDBERGER: Do you want us to get into 
24 that? 
25 MR. TEIN: Ted --
61 
1 MR. LEOPOLD: This is really big stuff that 
2 you're going through, but that's fine; just ask 
3 your question and move on. But do it one time. 
4 If you don't understand it, I'll let you follow 
5 up, but I'm not going to allow you to ask the same 
6 question the time and again and then call her a 
7 liar. Just ask the question, get the answer and 
8 move to the next subject matter. 
9 MR. TEIN: Ted, I'm sitting right across 
10 the table from you. 
11 MR. LEOPOLD: Yes, sir. 
12 MR. TEIN: Please be quiet. Don't yell. 
13 MR. LEOPOLD: I will not be quiet. 
14 MR. TEIN: Stop yelling. 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: Lewis, when I'm yelling 
16 you'll know it. I will not --
17 MR. TEIN: My name is not Lewis. 
18 MR. LEOPOLD: I thought your first name was 
19 Lewis, Mr. Tein. 
20 MR. TEIN: You watched me for three days at 
21 the evidentiary hearing where you sat in the back 
22 of the courtroom. You should know who I am.

23 MR. LEOPOLD: Well, that's the impression 
24 you must have made in the courtroom. 
25 I will not be quiet. 
62 
1 MR. TEIN: That's obnoxious. Stop being 
2 obnoxious. It's stupid. Let's go ahead with the 
3 questions. 
4 MR. LEOPOLD: I will make the record.

Why did you finally post your true age on

A. Uh --
Q. -- four days before you were scheduled to 
testify before the Grand Jury? 
A. I honestly don't know which MySpace, 
because I've had like a bazillion MySpaces and in that 
year, I had two, that one and another one and that one's 
been deleted. So I don't know which one you're referring

9 Q. Didn't Detective Recarey have to come to 
10 your house to pick you up to get you to testify in front 
11 of the Grand Jury? 
12 A. Possibly, maybe because I didn't have a 
13 ride. I was only 14 or 15 at the time. 
14 Q. Your mom didn't drive you? 
15 A. No. 
16 Q. Stepmom didn't drive you?

10 MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me. If I could just 
11 make the record, instead of interrupting me, 
12 please, that's what we do professionally. There's 
13 a recorder here. I'm certainly not being 
14 obstructionist. I'm going to make the record. 
15 But were going to act with some semblance of 
16 professionalism, hopefully, by all parties in the

25 MR. TEIN: Stop engaging me. Make your 
87 
1 speech and then we'll ask the questions. 
2 MR. LEOPOLD: Well, you won't let me finish 
3 making the objection, so it's difficult to do 
4 that. But if you want to follow with an 
5 appropriate question, feel free to do that. But 
6 we're not going to harass the witness. 
7 MR. TEIN: I disagree with everything 
8 you've said. Let's ask the questions. Okay? 
9 MR. LEOPOLD: Ask an appropriate question 
10 MR. TEIN: Are you going to stop talking?
