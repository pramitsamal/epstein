9 A. Two. 
10 Q. How old were they? 
A. Zack being one year older than me, 
and then the other person was two years older than me. 
Q. What was his name? 
A. Ryan 
Q. How old were you when you first had sexual 
intercourse? 
4P 44* 
Q. How many -- before you met Epstein, how 
many different men had you had any type of sexual 
activity with? 
21 la AtOtabg$03-0 
22 Q. Are you saying you never kissed a man other 
23 than those two? 
24 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection to the form of the 
25 question. 
1 THE WITNESS: Yes, I had kissed people 
2 before. 
3 BY MR. TEIN: 
4 Q. Before you met Epstein, had you ever had 
5 oral sex? 
6 A. No. 
7 Q. Ever in your life, have you exchanged sex 
8 for something of value?

10 MR. TEIN: We're done. 
11 THE WITNESS: Oh, okay. 
12 MR. LEOPOLD: We'll read. 
13 MS. BELOHLAVEK: I don't have any 
Page 104

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012499 
-0929104.TXT 
14 questions. Thank you. 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: Before we go off the record, 
16 it's my understanding -- Mr. Goldberger can 
17 correct the record, but we have stipulated that 
18 color copies of the documents that were identified 
19 for identification certainly will be attached to 
20 the deposition and counsel will be taking the 
21 photographs across street so that they can be 
22 laser color copied so that we have a copy, and I'm 
23 assuming he'll get a copy to the court reporter, 
24 too, to attach, actually a certified copy to the 
25 deposition. 
123 
1 MR. GOLDBERGER: Done. 
2 MR. LEOPOLD: That's if you agree to that. 
3 If not, then I want to pull each one out and put 
4 exhibit labels on them, which we should do before 
5 we leave. 
6 MR. GOLDBERGER: We're not going to do 
7 either. I'll have copies sent to the court 
8 reporter and she can attach them to the 
9 deposition. 
10 MR. LEOPOLD: So you're not going to agree 
11 to what we talked about during the break then. 
12 MR. GOLDBERGER: I'm not quite sure what 
13 your asking me to do. Let me finish. 
14 MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. Sure. That's fine. 
15 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. If you want me to 
16 go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office and make copies 
17 and then I'll give those to the court reporter, 
Page 105 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012500 
-0929104.TXT 
18 fine. All I'm saying is that I would avoid that 
19 process. I would send copies to the court 
20 reporter. But if it will make you happier 
21 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not? 
22 MR. GOLDBERGER: Let me finish. 
23 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not interrupting now. 
24 MR. GOLDBERGER: But if it will make you 
25 happier if I go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office 
124 
1 and make a copy of those photos that were part of 
2 this deposition and then I'll give them to the 
3 court reporter, I'll be happy to do it. 
4 MR. LEOPOLD: I trust you implicitly, 
5 however you with to do it. However, the 
6 documents, before they leave this room, need to 
7 have an exhibit sticky on them with the 
8 appropriate --
9 MR. GOLDBERGER: Want to go get some? We 
10 don't have any. 
11 MR. LEOPOLD: I will do that. Excuse me. 
12 Let me finish the record, please. You can't do 
13 that to the court reporter. She's going to stroke 
14 out. You can't do that. You have to let me --
15 MR. TEIN: Finish your sentence, Ted. You 
16 are the most long-winded lawyer I've ever seen in 
17 my life. Finish your sentence. 
18 MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, tell him not to raise 
19 his voice, please. 
20 MR. TEIN: Finish your sentence. Is there 
21 going to be a period at the end of the sentence or 
22 is it just going to be comma after comma after 
Page 106 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012501 
-0929104.TXT 
23 comma? 
24 Go ahead, lawyer. 
25 MR. LEOPOLD: All right. The exhibits, I 
125 
1 can't prevent you from taking them, but I will 
2 object and I will be bringing it to the court for 
3 sanctions. You cannot take the exhibits out of 
4 the room without them being marked. I want them 
5 marked, because you cannot identify in the record 
6 what was used. And with all due respect to 
7 Mr. Goldberger, I do not -- the way this 
8 deposition is going, I do not want to rely on 
9 Counsel from Miami to mark the appropriate 
10 exhibits. I will not do that. I cannot prevent 
11 you from taking them. But if you do, I will be 
12 bringing the matter to the court with appropriate 
13 sanctions, because that is improper. That is 
14 improper. When you use something in a deposition, 
15 they are to be marked. And you have refused to do 
16 that throughout for what ever reason. 
17 MR TEIN: You're wrong. Finish your 
18 sentence because you're talking about something 
19 you have no idea. 
20 Every single one is marked, Ted. Every 
21 single one is already marked. But you want to 
22 argue about everything. Ever single one is 
23 already marked. Isn't that silly, Ted? 
24 MR. GOLDBERGER: Thirty years of doing this 
25 and I have never had an argument over this. 
Page 107 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012502 
-0929104.TXT 
126 
1 MR. TEIN: You've made -- Ted, you are 
2 obstructionist, you are a liar. You have lied and 
3 misrepresented things, for the record. You are 
4 grandstanding. 
5 MR. LEOPOLD: You need to back up. 
6 MR. TEIN: No, no. I'm going to finish. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: You can finish, but don't 
8 hover over me. 
9 MR. TEIN: No one is hovering over you. 
10 Stop trying to make a lying record. 
11 Let me say something else. 
12 Don't you dare threaten me with sanctions, 
13 after you lied in a letter to my co-counsel about 
14 the fact -- be quiet. Be quiet and let me finish. 
15 You lied in a letter to my co-counsel, 
16 Mr. Leopold, in which you said -- it was a 
17 complete and utter lie -- that you were 
18 unavailable this morning because you had a 
19 hearing. That was a lie. I have never seen each 
20 lawyer deign to do something like that. 
21 So you will get the ex -- be quiet Let me 
22 finish. You behave. 
23 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at 
24 me. 
25 MR. TEIN: Listen. Be quiet and I won't 
127 
1 have a need to point it at you. 
2 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at 
3 MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold --
4 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at 
Page 108 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012503 
-0929104.TXT 
5 me. 
6 MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold, let me finish. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't raise your voice 
8 either. 
9 MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold 
10 MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, do you want to take 
11 care of this? 
12 MR. TEIN: Let me finish my sentence. The 
13 exhibits are marked. We are walking out of here. 
14 You are someone who misrepresents the 
15 record. It is absolutely atrocious what you do. 
16 That is not how a lawyer should behave. This 
17 deposition is over. You will get your exhibits, 
18 Mr. Leopold. 
19 MR. GOLDBERGER: I understand what you're 
20 saying, Michael, and I understand Ted's position. 
21 Just so there's -- we're going to have lots 
22 offer issues in this case. We're going to have 
23 lots of reasons to disagree. 
24 I'm going to take it over now and I'm going 
25 to make copies and I'm going to give them to 
128 
1 Ms. Consor. If you want to go find some exhibit 
2 labels and put some exhibit labels on it, be my 
3 guest. But that's what I'm offering to do. 
4 THE WITNESS: Let me say two things, 
5 because I am happy to always disagree and with 
6 you, I have no problem; we could always do it 
7 professionally. 
8 I want to say two things so the record is 
Page 109 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012504 
-0929104.TXT 
9 very clear. Since for whatever reason I have not 
10 been able to look at exhibits because they have 
11 been refused to have been shown to me --
12 MR. TEIN: That's a lie. 
13 MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, if you represent that 
14 the documents have the appropriate exhibit numbers 
15 or some identifying markings, 25, 30.000, whatever 
16 they may be, then you can take them, make copies, 
17 send me a copy, make sure the court reporter gets 
18 a copy and then send me a bill for my copy, that's 
19 fine. I didn't know that they are marked that way 
20 because I haven't been able to look at them. 
21 MR. GOLDBERGER: They are barcoded and the 
22 number that we've made reference to in the 
23 deposition coincides with the barcoding. 
24 MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. Eight by eleven 
25 color laser copies are fine. 
129 
1 MS. BELOHLAVEK: The State Attorneys Office 
2 is not going to charge anybody for color copies I 
3 print out. 
4 MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine He's going to 
5 take them back to his office . 
6 Secondly -- and I will be more than happy 
7 to do it, because it sounds like you all know more 
8 about it than I, but I'm happy to get affidavits 
9 from Mr. Pincus, Judge Stern, everybody else about 
10 what happened with this hearing today, because I 
11 
12 
13 
know very little about it. But my representations 
are what they are. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: They stay --
Page 110 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012505 
-0929104.TXT 
14 MR. LEOPOLD: Let me just finish for the 
15 record. 
16 Representations or comments about what 
17 happened, representation about this hearing this 
18 morning, I know very little about it. I --
19 MR. GOLDBERGER: I'll take your word on 
20 that. 
21 MR. LEOPOLD: No, no, no. I just put it on 
22 the record. I will get an affidavit -- I'm 
23 assuming it sounds like you need it -- from Mr. 
24 Pincus. I have no clue about what happened and 
25 why it was canceled. All I was told when I was 
130 
1 out of town yesterday was that the hearing this 
2 morning was cancelled. 
3 MR. GOLDBERGER: I'll take your word for 
4 it. 
5 MR. LEOPOLD: If you want an affidavit, 
6 I'll get it for you. 
7 MR. GOLDBERGER: It's a personal issue for 
8 me because I had to disrupt a vacation and if it 
9 was done just because it wasn't convenient for 
10 you, then I'm offended by that. But if you're 
11 telling me that it was planned and it didn't 
12 happen, I'll take your word for it. 
13 MR. LEOPOLD: I am more than happy to get 
14 you an affidavit, because I don't know the reason 
15 why it was canceled other than the fact that I'm 
16 assuming since my deposition was taken for four 
17 hours on Monday for preparation for the hearing 
Page 111 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012506 
-0929104.TXT 
18 today, for whatever reason it was canceled, I am 
19 told it is being re-noticed. Why it was canceled 
20 I have no idea, but if your co-counsel wishes an 
21 affidavit to that effect from Mr. Pincus, I'm more 
22 than happy to get it. But I don't know the reason 
23 why it was canceled. 
24 MR. TEIN: I don't need it. But what I do 
25 take issue with is regardless of why it was 
131 
1 canceled, you owed us the courtesy of saying, you 
2 know what? We can start earlier this morning. 
3 MR. LEOPOLD: I owe you nothing 
4 MR. TEIN: I don't care. Don't interrupt 
5 me. 
6 Because Jack canceled his vacation plans 
7 because of you. 
8 MR. GOLDBERGER: That's all right, that's 
9 all right. 
10 MR. TEIN: And you're selfish. And this 
11 deposition is over. Good-by Mr. Leopold. 
12 MR. GOLDBERGER: You can go off the record.

THE WITNESS: I do. 
10 BY MR. GOLDBERGER: 
11 Q. Would you state your name for the record, 
12 please. 
13 A. 
14 Q. Okay. 111111111 where do you live now? 
15 A. Address? 
16 Q. Sure. 
17 A. 
18 
19 Q. Do you live there alone or do you live with 
20 somebody there? 
21 A. My father. 
22 Q. Very good. And are you working now or not 
23 working? Sometimes you work and sometimes you don't? 
24 A. When I want to. 
25 Q. Okay. And how old are you today?

A. Twenty-one. 
Q. Very good. 
What we're going to do today is we're going 
to take what's know as a sworn statement from you. And 
my court reporter just put you under oath. So all I want 
you to do is tell the absolute truth today. 
7 A. Right. 
8 Q. I don't want you to color what you're 
9 saying in any way. Really, the only thing that will be 
10 of any use to anyone is if you just tell the absolute 
11 truth. 
12 A. Right. 
13 Q. So those are the instructions, okay? 
14 A. Okay. 
15 Q. All right. And sometimes -- I've been 
16 doing this for a lot of years and sometimes I talk like a 
17 lawyer too much, and if you don't understand what I'm --
18 A. That's your job. 
19 Q. I guess. But if you don't understand what 
20 I'm saying at some point, just say, Jack, say it in 
21 English, and I'll make it better for you. Okay? 
22 A. Okay. 
23 Q. So tell me how you first met Jeffrey 
24 Epstein. 
25 A. introduced me to him.

1 Q. Okay. So as far as you understood it and 
2 as far as what told you, you would be going over to

you remember whether you gave Jeffrey a massage with your

12 A. I mean probably, but I don't know. I can't

18 then just tell him and --

Do you want to come over this afternoon at four o'clock? 
A. Yeah, yeah. It wasn't --

5 or two.

8 and you'd go to give him a massage, right? 
9 A. Yes. 
10 Q. 
11 massage that occurred? 
12 A. It happened a few times. 
13 Q. Okay. And the few times that it happened, 
14 though, it was very sporadic and it was nothing that was 
15 planned? 
16 A. No way. 
17 Q. It just occurred? 
18 A. Right. 
19 Q. So it wasn't like there was a phone call, 
20 you know, Today we want you to come over and do more 
2/ than just a massage with Jeffrey? 
22 A. Right. 
23 Q. When anything more occurred you'd be over 
24 there and it would be totally voluntary on your part? 
25 A. Yes; definitely consensual.

particularly oral, but,

1 Q. And it would just be totally random and it 
2 would occur during the moment? 
3 A. Uh-huh. 
4 Q. Okay. There was nothing that was planned 
5 in advance concerning that? 
6 A. No. 
7 Q. And it didn't become every time you went 
8 over there that would happen, right? 
9 A. Yeah. No. 
10 Q. No, no. I mean just you would go over and 
11 give a massage one day and the phone call would be the 
12 same, Do you want to come over and give a massage, and 
13 maybe --
14 A. Yes. 
15 Q. -- maybe another time you would get a phone 
16 call, Do you want to come over and give a massage, and 
17 just because of the day it was or whatever was going on, 
18 it may have gone a little further where they may have 
19 been some touching, correct? 
20 A. Right. 
21 Q. And then the next time you could go over 
22 there and it could have been a regular massage again,

4 go have sex? That was not the case? 
5 A. No. 
6 Q. Never, never, never, right? 
7 A. Yes. 
8 Q. All right. There were times when you would 
9 be away and not be in Palm Beach and -- I mean you very 
10 much thought that Jeffrey was your friend? You treated 
11 him as a friend? 
12 A. Yes, definitely. I felt that he was my 
13 friend. 
14 Q. And there were times when maybe you were 
15 out of town and for whatever reason, you found yourself 
16 in a situation where you needed some money, correct? 
17 A. Yes. 
18 Q. Okay. And you felt that the relationship 
19 was such that you could call Jeffrey and it never had 
20 anything to do with a massage or anything. You would 
21 say, Listen, I could use a couple of dollars. I have a 
22 problem. 
23 A. Yes. 
24 Q. And would he ever hesitate to help you out? 
Page 19 
to make was that there were never phone calls that would 
come to you and they would say, Do you want to come over

2 listen -- he would talk to you about life and about --
3 A. Yes. 
4 Q. -- about what you wanted to do with your 
5 life? 
6 A. Yes. 
7 Q. And he said, If you ever find yourself in 
8 trouble, you have a friend in me and you can give me a 
9 call? 
10 A. Yes. 
11 Q. Okay. If you had to guess -- and 
12 recognizing that there can be no accuracy here -- if you 
13 had to guess, how many times do you think you went over 
14 to Jeffrey's house? 
15 A. I would say at least five, less than ten. 
16 Q. Okay. I think that's kind of a fair range. 
17 And during those five to ten times that you 
18 went there, was there ever anything uncomfortable, in 
19 your mind, that occurred over at Jeffrey's house? 
20 A. No. 
21 Q. Okay. I know we've touched on this, but 
22 just Lilly, the detail person, makes sure that we get 
23 everything. After you met Jeffrey the first time did you 
24 ever talk to him on the telephone about arranging a 
25 massage or anything like that? 
Q. 
And in fact, did he not tell you that, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012534

1 A. No. 
2 Q. Okay. And you never e-mailed him or 
3 anything like that? 
4 A. No, no. 
5 Q. Never text-messaged him? 
6 A. No. 
7 Q. Okay. Now at times when you would go over 
8 zo give a massage, Jeffrey, while he was getting the 
9 massage, would be preoccupied doing a lot of things, 
10 right? 
11 A. Yes, very often. 
12 Q. He was a busy guy? 
13 A. Yes. 
14 Q. He would be on the telephone talking Lo 
15 folks while you were giving a massage? 
16 A. Yes. Sometimes it would be just a massage 
17 and he'd be pretty much doing business the whole time. 
18 Q. Right. Certainly it wasn't sex or anything 
19 like that? 
20 A. No. 
21 Q. He would be doing business and you'd be 
22 massaging him? 
23 A. Yes.

Sworn Statement taken before Maria Powers, 
Court Reporter and Notary Public in and for the State 
of Florida at Large, in the above cause. 
Thereupon, 
having been first duly sworn, was examined and 
testified as follows: 
DIRECT EXAMINATION 
as you remember, my name is Jack 
Goldberger. I think we met last Friday, actually. 
You voluntarily came in and gave a sworn 
statement to me concerning your knowledge and your 
friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. 
I would like to very, very, briefly continue 
that statement today, and just focus on one area that 
we forgot to question you about last Friday. 
All I want you to tell me is the absolute 
truth here this evening. There's no right answer, 
other than the truth, okay? 
A Right. 
I haven't promised you or asked you to do 
anything, one way or the other, have I? 
A No.

1 Q So, we covered a lot of ground last time. 
2 One area that I didn't ask you about is 
3 contact that you've had with either the FBI or the U.S. 
4 Attorney's Office, within the last two or three years. 
5 Can you guess or estimate how many times 
6 someone from the FBI or the U.S. Attorney's Office or 
7 some other law enforcement agency, has attempted to 
8 contact you in the last couple of years? 
9 A I'd have to say -- well, maybe five or six 
10 meetings with, and more than that with phone contact. 
11 
Let's try to break it down by meetings and 
12 phone contacts. I think that would be the best way to 
13 do it. 
14 Of the actual meetings that you've had with 
15 someone from law enforcement or from the U.S. 
16 Attorney's Office, who do you remember being present at 
17 those meetings? 
18 A Nesbith was at all of them. 
19 Q When we're talking about Nesbith we're 
20 talking about an FBI agent by the name of Nesbith 
21 Kurkendall? 
22 A Yes. 
23 Q And Nesbith was present at all those 
24 meetings? 
25 A Yes.

2 A The first one was a guy, I'm not sure of his 
3 name. And then there's another one that had -- another 
4 lady with the victim's rights. 
5 Q She was victim's right representative? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q We talked about a lawyer by the name Marie 
8 Villafona; do you know whether she was present during 
9 any of those meetings? 
10 A I'm not sure of the name. 
11 Q The first time that you met with Nesbith, 
12 where did that take place? 
13 A Here, in my backyard. 
14 0 In your backyard, at your home in Western 
15 Palm Beach County, right? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Did she announce to you that she was coming, 
18 or did she just show up? 
19 A She showed up. 
20 Q Unannounced? 
21 A Yes. 
22 Q During that time, I assume that you told her 
23 about your relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and any 
24 contact you've had with him, correct? 
Q Okay, go ahead. 
25 A Correct.

1 Q Did she tell you anything about whether you 
2 were a victim in this case, or anything like that, at 
3 that meeting? 
4 A Yes, she said I was a victim/witness in this, 
5 and that there's victim rights that I'm entitled to, 
6 which include counseling and whatnot. 
7 Q Did you tell her, at that time, that you 
8 didn't feel that you were a victim at all, and that 
9 anything that you've done with Jeffrey Epstein was 
10 totally voluntary? 
11 A Yeah, I did tell her that everything was, you 
12 know, consensual with everything, and I don't agree 
13 with anything that's going on. 
14 Q Did she try and pressure you into being a 
15 victim in this thing, when you were not a victim? 
16 A I wouldn't say that she pressured me, but she 
17 tried to be as convincing as possible. 
18 Q Maybe the use of the word pressure is too 
19 strong. But she was trying to change your opinion of 
20 what the relationship was with Jeffrey? 
21 A Yes, she was trying to make me feel bad about 
22 it, in a way, about what was going on. 
23 Q And you didn't feel bad about it, you felt 
24 everything was okay, but she was trying to make you 
25 feel bad, like something wrong had occurred?

1 A Yeah. 
2 Q How long did that meeting go on for? 
3 A Probably about -- at least an hour. 
4 Q When was the next time that you had contact 
5 with Nesbith or someone else from law enforcement? 
6 A I'm not sure, probably a month or later. I 
7 mean, she probably called me and let me know that she 
8 was going to -- you know, she wanted to meet sometime 
9 soon, to deliver the victim's rights papers to me. 
10 Q So there was a time, after you first met, 
11 where, despite the fact that you said, I don't consider 
12 myself a victim in this, she called you and said, I 
13 want to bring you some paperwork that talks about your 
14 victim's rights? 
15 A Yes. 
16 Q What was your response to her when she told 
17 you that? 
18 A I told her I would meet with her, 'cause she 
19 wanted me to meet with the other woman involved. And 
20 they gave them to me. 
21 I took them, but I never really told them I 
22 needed counseling or anything like that. 
23 Q Where did that meeting take place? 
24 A I believe it was Panera Bread in 
25 Wellington.

She actually came and sought you out at a 
2 restaurant? 
3 A Well, I told her to meet me there. 
4 Q Were you working there or were you just --
5 A No, I was just there. 
6 Q So she called you and said, I really, really 
7 want to see you. And you said, if you want to see me, 
8 meet me at Panera Bread? 
9 A Yes. 
10 Q Did you feel if you didn't meet her, she 
11 wasn't going to go away, that you had to deal with 
12 her? 
13 A Well, I mean, it wasn't particularly that. I 
14 knew that she was going to contact me because of this 
15 case. Because, whether I want to be involved or not, I 
16 have to be. 
17 Q Okay. That's two meetings that I know of. I 
18 think you indicated that, if you had to guess, there 
19 were maybe a total of five meetings. 
20 Are there other meetings that we haven't 
21 talked about that occurred? 
22 A Yeah, but they were very vague They weren't 
23 anything of importance. And, I mean, it was just 
24 her -- or of importance to me, anyway. 
25 Q Would she call you and say, listen, I really,

1 really, want to talk to you about being a victim or --
2 
A It wasn't always directly about being a 
3 victim. And, every-time we talked, she would always 
4 touch upon the fact that if I need any help or 
5 so-on-and-so-forth, because I am a victim in this 
6 case. 
7 Q I assume, based on what you're telling me, 
8 you continued to tell her, I'm not a victim? 
9 A I just let her say what she said. I never 
10 got counseling. But she knows from the beginning, and, 
11 I continued to reassure her, that I don't feel that 
12 way. 
13 Q So, the first time you met with her, when you 
14 spent about an hour with her and you went through all 
15 your contact with Jeffrey, that's what occurred at that 
16 meeting, and she talked to you about being a victim at 
17 that meeting? 
18 A Yes. 
19 Q And then there was this second meeting, where 
20 she brought a victim's rights person with her, and that 
21 took place at Panera Bread, right? 
22 
A Yes. 
23 Q And you had the same response, listen, you 
24 think I'm a victim. You could give me the information, 
25 but I don't need that information, right?

A Right, pretty much. 
And then there were some other contacts. 
Would she call you and want to talk to you 
4 about the specific facts about the case? I mean, why 
5 would she contact --
6 A Yeah, I mean, just to re-question me about 
7 certain things, because she wasn't sure that the 
8 answers were --
9 
Were those in-person meetings? 
10 A I mean, a lot of them were on the phone. I 
11 mean, it wasn't very often that we would meet. 
12 Q Was there any other time that you did meet? 
13 We talked about two times that you actually 
14 did meet, once here at your home and once at Panera 
15 Bread. 
16 Were there any other actual meetings, or did 
17 the others occur on the phone? 
18 A There were other meetings, but they were, 
19 like I said, not really important. 
20 Q Do you remember where they were that they 
21 took place? 
22 A They came to my job, I think, two times. 
23 Q When you say they --
24 A Well, it Nesbith the first time, and, the 
25 second time, it was the David Copperfield investigators

1 with Nesbith. 
2 Q Right. 
3 So, the third time that you met with Nesbith, 
4 she came to your job, and she wanted to talk to you 
5 about more facts of the case? 
6 A Ah-huh. 
7 Q And, during that meeting, she also talked to 
8 you about your rights as a victim again? 
9 A Yeah, she always reassured me of my rights as 
10 a victim. 
11 Q Then there would have been a fourth time 
12 we're talking about now, where there were investigators 
13 from Washington coming down, concerning David 
14 Copperfield, and Nesbith introduced them to you, 
15 correct? 
16 A Right. 
17 Q I take it what you're telling me is that 
18 Nesbith seized the opportunity to talk to you again 
19 about being a victim, right? 
20 A She always kind of comes out as asking if I'm 
21 okay, and if everything okay. And if I ever need any 
22 kind of help or anything, with -- you know, I could 
23 always have help. 
24 Q Did you continue to say, listen, I'm fine, 
25 there's no issues here?

A I just -- I mean, I was never pushy on it. I 
2 just, like I said, she always knows. 
3 I may not tell her every time, but she always 
4 knows how I feel about this case. 
5 Q Meaning? 
6 A I don't need any-thing. 
7 Q Meaning that you made it really clear to her 
8 that you didn't need any help? 
9 A Yeah, from the beginning, I was very, very 
10 reassuring about how I felt about it. And I wasn't 
11 very happy.

1 say, I'm really not a victim here? 
2 A Like I said, I was, like, okay. You know,

4 every time, it was the same thing. 
5 I mean I was never -- I mean, I was never 
6 mean to any of them. I never gave anybody attitude 
7 about anything. But, I mean, she knows that. She 
8 knows how I feel.

and, then, you know, okay, goodbye.

would forward the documents and information listed below to my attention or, if you prefer, to 
Special Agent E. Nesbitt Kuyrkendall, Federal Bureau of Investigation, 500 South Flagler Drive, 
Suite 500, West Palm Beach, PL 33404. If you require a grand jury subpoena for any of the items,

December 13, 2007 
I am writing not to respond to your asserted policy concerns regarding Mr. Epstein's Non-
Prosecution Agreement, which will be addressed by the United States Attorney, but the time has 
come for me to respond to the ever-increasing attacks on my role in the investigation and 
negotiations. 
It is an understatement to say that I am surprised by your allegations regarding my role 
because I thought that we had worked very well together in resolving this dispute. I also am 
surprised because I feel that I bent over backwards to keep in mind the effect that the agreement 
would have on Mr. Epstein and to make sure that you (and he) understood the repercussions of the 
agreement. For example, I brought to your attention that one potential plea could result in no gain 
time for your client; I corrected one of your calculations of the Sentencing Guidelines that would 
have resulted in Mr. Epstein spending far more time in prison than you projected; I contacted the 
Bureau of Prisons to see whether Mr. Epstein would be eligible for the prison camp that you desired; 
and I told you my suspicions about the source of the press leak and suggested ways to avoid the 
press. Importantly, I continued to work with you in a professional manner even after I learned that 
you had been proceeding in bad faith for several weeks — thinking that I had incorrectly concluded 
that solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution was a registrable offense and that you would 
fool our Office into letting Mr. Epstein plead to a non-registrable offense. Even now, when it is 
clear that neither you nor your client ever intended to abide by the terms of the agreement that he 
signed, I have never alleged misconduct on your part. 
The first allegation that you raise is that I assiduously hid from you the fact that Bert 
Ocariz is a friend of my boyfriend and that I have a longstanding relationship with Mr. Ocariz. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012577 
JAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. 
DECEMBER 13, 2007 
PAGE 2 OF 5 
I informed you that I selected Mr. Ocariz because he was a friend and classmate of two people 
whom I respected, and that I had never met or spoken with Mr. Ocariz prior to contacting him about 
this case. All of those facts are true. I still have never met Mr. Ocariz, and, at the time that he and 
I spoke about this case, he did not know about my relationship with his friend. You suggest that I 
should have explicitly informed you that one of the referrals came from my boyfriend rather than 
simply a friend, which is the term I used, but it is not my nature to discuss my personal 
relationships with opposing counsel. Your attacks on me and on the victims establish why I wanted 
to find someone whom I could trust with safeguarding the victims' best interests in the face of 
intense pressure from an unlimited number of highly skilled and well paid attorneys. Mr. Ocariz 
was that person. 
One of your letters suggests a business relationship between Mr. Ocariz and my boyfriend. 
This is patently untrue and neither my boyfriend nor I would have received any financial benefit 
from Mr. Ocariz's appointment. Furthermore, after Mr. Ocariz learned more about Mr. Epstein's 
actions (as described below), he expressed a willingness to handle the case pro bono, with no 
financial benefit even to himself. Furthermore, you were given several other options to choose from, 
including the Podhurst firm, which was later selected by Judge Davis. You rejected those other 
options. 
You also allege that I improperly disclosed information about the case to Mr. Ocariz. I 
provided Mr. Ocariz with a bare bones summary of the agreement's terms related to his appointment 
to help him decide whether the case was something he and his firm would be willing to undertake. 
I did not provide Mr. Ocariz with facts related to the investigation because they were confidential 
and instead recommended that he Google Mr. Epstein's name for background information. When 
Mr. Ocariz asked for additional information to assist his firm in addressing conflicts issues, I 
forwarded those questions to you, and you raised objections for the first time. I did not share any 
further information about Mr. Epstein or the case. Since Mr. Ocariz had been told that you 
concurred in his selection, out of professional courtesy, I informed Mr. Ocariz of the Office's 
decision to use a Special Master to make the selection and told him that the Office had made contact 
with Judge Davis. We have had no further contact since then and I have never had contact with 
Judge Davis. I understand from you that Mr. Ocariz contacted Judge Davis. You criticize his 
decision to do so, yet you feel that you and your co-counsel were entitled to contact Judge Davis to 
try to lobby him to select someone to your liking, despite the fact that the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement vested the Office with the exclusive right to select the attorney representative. 
Another reason for my surprise about your allegations regarding misconduct related to the 
Section 2255 litigation is your earlier desire to have me perform the role of facilitator to convince 
the victims that the lawyer representative was selected by the Office to represent their interests alone 
and that the out-of-court settlement of their claims was in their best interests. You now state that 
doing the same things that you had asked me to do earlier is improper meddling in civil litigation. 
Much of your letter reiterates the challenges to Detective Recarey's investigation that have 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012578 
JAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. 
DECEMBER 13, 2007 
PAGE 3 OF 5 
already been submitted to the Office on several occasions and you suggest that I have kept that 
information from those who reviewed the proposed indictment package. Contrary to your 
suggestion, those submissions were attached to and incorporated in the proposed indictment 
package, so your suggestion that I tried to hide something from the reviewers is false. I also take 
issue with the duplicity of stating that we must accept as true those parts of the Recarey reports and 
witness statements that you like and we must accept as false those parts that you do not like. You 
and your co-counsel also impressed upon me from the beginning the need to undertake an 
independent investigation. It seems inappropriate now to complain because our independent 
investigation uncovered facts that are unfavorable to your client. 
You complain that I forced your client and the State Attorney's Office to proceed on 
charges that they do not believe in, yet you do not want our Office to inform the State Attorney's 
Office of facts that support the additional charge nor do you want any of the victims of that charge 
to contact Ms. Belohlavek or the Court. Ms. Belohlavek's opinion may change if she knows the full 
scope of your client's actions. You and I spent several weeks trying to identify and put together a 
plea to federal charges that your client was willing to accept. Yet your letter now accuses me of 
manufacturing charges of obstruction of justice, making obscene phone calls, and violating child 
privacy laws. When Mr. Lourie told you that those charges would embarrass the Office, he meant 
that the Office was unwilling to bend the facts to satisfy Mr. Epstein's desired prison sentence — a 
statement with which I agree. 
I hope that you understand how your accusations that I imposed ultimatums and forced 
you and your client to agree to unconscionable contract terms cannot square with the true facts of 
this case. As explained in letters from Messrs. Acosta and Sloman, the indictment was postponed 
for more than five months to allow you and Mr. Epstein's other attorneys to make presentations to 
the Office to convince the Office not to prosecute. Those presentations were unsuccessful. As you 
mention in your letter, I —a simple line AUSA — handled the primary negotiations for the Office, and 
conducted those negotiations with you, Ms. Sanchez, Mr. Lewis, and a host of other highly skilled 
and experienced practitioners. As you put it, your group has a combined 250 years experience to 
my fourteen. The agreement itself was signed by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Sanchez, and Mr. Lefcaut, 
whose experience speaks for itself. You and I spent hours negotiating the terms, including when to 
use a versus the and other minutiae. When you and I could not reach agreement, you repeatedly 
went over my head, involving Messrs. Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta in the negotiations at 
various times. In any and all plea negotiations the defendant understands that his options are to 
plead or to continue with the investigation and proceed to trial. Those were the same options that 
were proposed to Mr. Epstein, and they are not persecution or intimidation tactics. Mr. Epstein 
chose to sign the agreement with the advice of a multitude of extremely noteworthy counsel. 
You also make much of the fact that the names of the victims were not released to Mr. 
Epstein prior to signing the Agreement. You never asked for such a term. During an earlier 
meeting, where Mr. Black was present, he raised the concern that you now voice. Mr. Black and 
I did not have a chance to discuss the issue, but I had already conceived of a way to resolve that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012579 
JAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. 
DECEMBER 13, 2007 
PAGE 4 OF 5 
issue if it were raised during negotiations. As I stated, it was not, leading me to believe that it was 
not a matter of concern to the defense. Since the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the 
agents and I have vetted the list of victims more than once. In one instance, we decided to remove 
a name because, although the minor victim was touched inappropriately by Mr. Epstein, we decided 
that the link to a payment was insufficient to call it prostitution. I have always remained open to 
a challenge to the list, so your suggestion that Mr. Epstein was forced to write a blank check is 
simply unfounded. 
Your last set of allegations relates to the investigation of the matter. For instance, you claim 
that some of the victims were informed of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough 
investigation of their allegations against Mr. Epstein. This also is false. None of the victims was 
informed of the right to sue under Section 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three 
victims were notified shortly after the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement of the general 
terms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim notification, and no further 
notifications were done. Throughout this process you have seen that I have prepared this case as 
though it would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility of damages claims prior 
to concluding the matter by plea or trial would only undermine my case. If my reassurances are 
insufficient, the fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein should assure you of 
the integrity of the investigation.' 
'There are numerous other unfounded allegations in your letter about document demands, 
the money laundering investigation, contacting potential witnesses, speaking with the press, and the 
like. For the most part, these allegations have been raised and disproven earlier and need not be 
readdressed. However, with respect to the subpoena served upon the private investigator, contrary 
to your assertion, and as your co-counsel has already been told, I did consult with the Justice 
Department prior to issuing the subpoena and I was told that because I was not subpoenaing an 
attorney's office or an office physically located within an attorney's office, and because the business 
did private investigation work for individuals (rather than working exclusively for Mr. Black), I 
could issue a grand jury subpoena in the normal course, which is what I did. I also did not 
threaten the State Attorney's Office with a grand jury subpoena, as the correspondence with their 
grand jury coordinator makes perfectly clear. 
With regard to your allegation of my filing the Palm Beach Police Department's probable 
cause affidavit with the court knowing that the public could access it, I do not know to what you 
are referring. All documents related to the grand jury investigation have been filed under seal, and 
the Palm Beach Police Department's probable cause affidavit has never been filed with the Court. 
If, in fact, you are referring to the Ex Parte Declaration of Joseph Recarey that was filed in response 
to the motion to quash the grand jury subpoena, it was filed both under seal and ex parte, so no one 
should have access to it except the Court and myself. Those documents are still in the Court file 
only because you have violated one of the terms of the Agreement by failing to withdraw 
[Epstein's] pending motion to intervene and to quash certain grand jury subpoenas.

With respect to Ms. Miller, I contacted her attorney - who was paid for by Mr. Epstein and 
was directed by counsel for Mr. Epstein to demand immunity - and asked only whether he still 
represented Ms. Miller and if he wanted me to send the victim notification letter to him. He asked 
what the letter would say and I told him that the letter would be forthcoming in about a week and 
that I could not provide him with the terms. With respect to Ms. Miller's status as a victim, you 
again want us to accept as true only facts that are beneficial to your client and to reject as false 
anything detrimental to him. Ms. Miller made a number of statements that are contradicted by 
documentary evidence and a review of her recorded statement shows her lack of credibility with 
respect to a number of statements. Based upon all of the evidence collected, Ms. Miller is classified 
as a victim as defined by statute. Of course, that does not mean that Ms. Miller considers herself 
a victim or that she would seek damages from Mr. Epstein. I believe that a number of the identified 
victims will not seek damages, but that does not negate their legal status as victims. 
I hope that you now understand that your accusations against myself and the agents are 
unfounded. In the future, I recommend that you address your accusations to me so that I can correct 
any misunderstandings before you make false allegations to others in the Department. I hope that 
we can move forward with a professional resolution of this matter, whether that be by your client's 
adherence to the contract that he signed, or by virtue of a trial.

You also accuse me of  broaden [ing] the scope of the investigation without any foundation 
for doing so by adding charges of money laundering and violations of a money transmitting business 
to the investigation. Again, I consulted with the Justice Department's Money Laundering Section 
about my analysis before expanding that scope. The duty attorney agreed with my analysis.
