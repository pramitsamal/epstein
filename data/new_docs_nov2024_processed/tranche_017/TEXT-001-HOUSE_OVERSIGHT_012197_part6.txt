deemed to be a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any defense to such 
prosecution on the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of 
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States to a speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute 
of limitations for a period of months equal to the period between the signing of this 
agreement and the breach of this agreement as to those offenses that were the subject of the 
grand jury's investigation. Epstein further asserts and certifies that he understands that the 
Fifth Amendment and Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that all 
felonies must be charged in an indictment presented to a grand jury. Epstein hereby agrees 
and consents that, if a prosecution against him is instituted for any offense that was the 
subject of the grand jury's investigation, it may be by way of an Information signed and filed 
by the United States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury as 
to any such offense.

Re: Grand Jury Investigation—Confidential 
Dear 
This letter is an invitation for you to testify before a federal Grand Jury, and is 
supplied in order to provide helpful background information about the Grand Jury. The 
Grand Jury consists of from sixteen to twenty-three persons from the Southern District of 
Florida. It is their responsibility to inquire into federal crimes which may have been 
committed in this District. 
As a Grand Jury witness you will be asked to testify and answer questions under oath, 
and to produce records and documents. Only the members of the Grand Jury, attorneys for 
the United States and a stenographer- are permitted in the Grand Jury roorn while you testify.. 
. The U.S. Department of Justice encourages prosecutors to notify an individual in 
appropriate cases that he or she is a target of a grand jury investigation. Accordingly, you 
are hereby notified that you are a target of a federal grand jury investigation in the Southern 
District of Florida concerning suspected violations of federal law, including but not limited 
to, possible violations of Title 18, United- States Code, Sections 2, 371, 1512, 1591, 1952, 
1956, 1960, 2421, 2422, and 2423. 
You are advised that the destruction or alteration of any document required to be 
produced:before the grand jury constitutes serious violation of federal law, including but.not 
limited to Obstraction of justice. 
A target is a person as to whom the prosecutors or the Grand Jury have substantial

evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the 
prosecutors, is a putative defendant. 
This letter constitutes an invitation to you to testify on your own behalf before the 
grand jury about matters under investigation. Of course, you are not required to appear 
before the grand jury. The decision whether to do so is a voluntary matter which is entirely 
up to you. The grand jury, if in fact it learns of this opportunity afforded to you, will be 
instructed not to draw any adverse inference from your failure to appear should you decide 
not to accept this invitation. You mustfurther understand that should you decide to testify, 
your testimony could be used against you if any criminal charges should be flied against you. 
Should you decide to appear before the grand jury, you will have the same rights and 
obligations as any non-immonized grand jury witness. Specifically, 
You may refuse to answer any question if a truthful answer to the question 
would tend to incriminate you. 
You have the right to stop answering questions at any time. 
Anything you say maybe used against you at the grand jury or in a subsequent 
legal proceeding. 
The grand jury will permit. you a reasonable opportunity to ..stop . outside the 
grand jury room to consult with your attorney, if you so desire, at any point 
during the testimony you give, 
Please be further advised that the giving of false testimony before the grand jur3r will 
subject -you to a prosecution for perjury in addition to the violations set forth above. 
As a target of a grand jury investigation who has been asked to appear before the 
grand jury, you may wish to retain the services of an attorney. If you =not afford the 
services of independent counsel, the Court may be able to appoint Counsel to represent you. 
If you would like the United States to ask the Court to appoint an attorney to represent you, 
please contact the undersigned at 561 209-1047, The United States is investigating other 
individuals, and you may be interested in cooperating with the United States against those 
other targets. If you hire an attorney, or if the Court appoints one to represent you, that 
counsel can contact me to discuss that possibility.

Re: Subpoena to Custodian of Records-NES. LLC 
Dear Mr. Lelbouri: 
I write in response to your letter of July 18, 2007 regarding the grand jury subpoena issued 
to the Custodian ofRecords for NES, LLC. Ihave attached an identical subpoena containing areturn 
date of September 11, 2007, and subpoenas for two NES employees, Eric Gany and Harry Beller. 
If you will not be representing Messrs. Gany and Beller, please let me know. 
First, as I mentioned in my earlier correspondence, a properly executed declaration from. the 
Custodian of Records is needed, and, if no documents responsive to a particular request exist, the 
Custodian should certify that under penalty of perjury. 
Second, you write that NES has no documents responsive to Requests 1 through 5. 'know 
that NES has several credit card accounts for the benefit of the persons who manage Mr. Epstein's 
properties, including Janusz Banasiak and Alfredo Rodriguez. I also know that NES regularly 
receives money from an account that is used to pay expenses at 358 El Milo Way and also wires 
money to that same account Those wire transfers fall within the time period called for by the 
subpoena and number in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. IfNES does not maintain records of 
its banking activities, then I would like to see a copy of its document retention policy, so I have 
added that to the Attachment to the Subpoena. 
Third, Mr. Manche's con:unent to you about potential money laundering charges related only 
to a resolution ofthe case. In other words, if the sex offense case is resolved, the Office would close 
its investigation into other areas as well The matter has not been, and it does not appear that it will 
be, resolved so the money laundering investigation continues, and Request Number 6 will not be 
withdrawn. The request is not overbroad and is stated with particularity, so please comply with the 
request by the new deadline.

1 is definitely under 18 still, and I think there is a second minor. The appointment of ififfl

them the assistance of an independent attorney who represents them (as opposed to me, who 
represents the government). If you are willing to provide the girls with independent counsel, at

Hi Jay — Sony for the delay. The U.S. Attorney had a last-minute concern, that I think I fixed it 
is in the first It Appearing clause following the list of statutes potentially violated). 
After you get the green light, let's discuss the potential representative. The person I am thinking 
of has run a preliminaiy conflicts check and it looks alright. 
Also, to address Mr. Epstein's concern regarding the list of names, I wanted to tell you that I 
have compiled a list of 34 confirmed minors. There are six others, whose names we already 
have, who need to be interviewed by the FBI to confirm whether they were 17 or 18 at the time 
of their activity with Mr. Epstein. Once those interviews are completed, I can finalize the list of 
identified victims, which I will put in a formal document that I will maintain until the time of 
Mr. Epstein's sentencing. 
Assuming that this agreement is fine, please execute at least three copies, and send one to me by 
fax and the rest by FedEx. I will execute and send the copies back. 
Thank you.

RE: Do you have a signed copy? 
Thank you, Jay. I have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and Rolando. I don't 
anticipate it going any further than that. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one 
copy to you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept confidential since it also 
contains identifying information about the girls. 
When we reach an agreement about the attorney representative for the girls, we can discuss 
what I can tell him and the girls about the agreement. I know that Andy promised Chief Reiter 
an update when a resolution was achieved. (Something I wouldn't have promised in light of what 
happened last year.) Rolando is calling, but Rolando knows not to tell Chief Reiter about the 
money issue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and the amount of time that 
has been agreed to. Rolando also is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.

Talk to Jack Goldberger about this group. They are all very good personal injury lawyers, but I 
have concerns about whether there would be an inherent tension because they may feel that 
THEY might make more money (and get a lot more press coverage) if they proceed outside the 
terms of the plea agreement. (Sorry — I just have a bias against plaintiffs' attorneys.) One nice 
thing about Bert is that he is in Miami where there has been almost no coverage of this case. 
Just so you know, I have never met Bert, but a good friend in our appellate section and one of the 
district judges in Miami are good friends with him and recommended him. 
Can you let me know tomorrow? I am going to be out for a while starting on Friday, and I 
would like to get this underway before I leave.

Good morning, Jay. We need to resolve the attorney issue today. It has been 
weeks since execution of the contract, and there is no need for further delay. 
As far as the five attorney names that we will be providing, I propose Bert 
Ocariz, Katherine Ezell at Podhurst Orseck, Stuart Grossman, Ed Rogers, and 
Walter Cobath. 
If you would like to use the same Special Master to resolve fees disputes as 
well as to handle the selection of the attorney, I would recommend that we use 
retired 11th Circuit Judge Joseph Hatchett instead of Judge Davis because of 
Judge Davis's health problems. (No one has contacted Judge Hatchett yet, but 
one of the District Judges in Miami mentioned him as a good choice.) 
I am available for a conference call between 9:00 and 10:00, and between 3:15 
and 6:00. Please call me on my cell and let me know which of 
those times works best for you. 
Thank you.

Subject RE: Conference Call with Bert Ocariz 
, 
15:ime§ageiba&beer.r:orwar. 
Hi Jay — I already told Bert that there is no indictment and, as I mentioned, he doesn't really 
need to/want to see the entire plea agreement, .just the relevant paragraphs so that he understands 
what the scope of his representation will be. I think they would be happy knowing that their 
hourly rate will be paid when it is billed. The concern is, if all 40 girls decide they want to sue, 
they don't want to be in a situation where Mr. Epstein says this is getting too expensive, we won' 
t pay any more attorneys' fees. 
Two suggestions, that I haven't run past Bert, are: 
1. Mr. Epstein signs a standard fee agreement, where one of his attorneys or 
accountants who is not working on the damages litigation receives a monthly bill with 
attorney's fees charged at an hourly rate and costs billed monthly. The bills will have 
any privileged information redacted. If there is a dispute about a bill that cannot be 
resolved, it will be submitted to a mediator for resolution. 
2. If that is too open-ended for Mr. Epstein, do the hourly/monthly billing until Berl. 
has had a chance to confer with all of the girls to determine how many want him to 
represent them. Once it is known how many girls will be represented by Bert, and maybe 
who those girls are, there can be a more educated discussion about estimated fees and 
costs. 
Just some food for thought. I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be reachable by cell 
Phone. I will make sure Bert is available and confirm the time with you.

Subject: Conference Call with Bert Ocariz 
Hi Jay — Bert's firm has raised a number of good questions about how they are going to get paid 
and setting up a procedure that avoids any conflict of interest with their clients. Are you around 
today to do a conference call? Let me know what times work for you because Bert wants to get 
their conflicts counsel on the call with us. 
These are some of the questions he sent to me. I told Bert that as part of our agreement we (the 
federal government) are not going to indict Mr. Epstein, but gave him an idea of the charges that 
we had planned to bring as related to 18 USC 2255. With respect to question 2, do I have your 
permission to send Bert just that section of the plea agreement that applies to the damages claims 
(I would recommend sending paragraphs 7 through 10, or at least 7 and 8)? Can you talk with 
your client about items 3 and 4? I envisioned Shook Hardy sending regular bills to you, with 
any privileged information redacted, and being paid like every other client pays the bills. 
1. Can we get a copy of the indictment (or can you tell me the nature of the crimes against the girls)?

concedes to in the civil case?

minor. 
5. Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen and resident of the State of New York. 
6. This is an action for damages in excess of $50 million. 
7. This Court has jurisdiction of this action and the claims set forth herein pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. §1332(a), as the matter in controversy (i) exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs; 
and (ii) is between citizens of different states. 
8. This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §I391(a) as a substantial 
part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District. 
Factual Allegations  
9. At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein (Epstein) was an adult male, 52 
years old. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires. He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
10. Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one 
of his victims. 
11. Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
12. An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach 
HERMAN 8, MERMELSTEIN, P, A. 
- 2 - 
www.hermanlaw_com 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012638 
Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a 
wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's 
plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence 
or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring 
one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally 
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who 
would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per massage session - and 
who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of 
improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. 
13. Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival. at 
Epstein's mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, 
who gathered the girl' s personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen 
would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition 
to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the 
bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter 
wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and 
direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more Iewd, lascivious and 
sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator. 
14. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to 
give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's mansion 
in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced. to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room 
with the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a towel. He

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012639 
removed his towel, and laid down naked on the massage table. He dtalanded that Jane remove her 
clothes. In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane complied, removing her clothes except for her 
underwear. Epstein then sexually assaulted Jane. 
15. After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get 
dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought 
Jane home. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was p aid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane 
to him. 
16. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane experienced 
confusion, shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral. 
COUNT I 
Sexual Assault 
17, Plaintiff Jane Doe by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, repeats

emotional damages. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe, by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, 
demands judgment against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein for compensatory damages, punitive damages,

7. At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein (Epstein) was an adult male, 52 
years old. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires. He is himself a man of ti-emendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
8. Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money. In or about 2004-2005, Jane Doe, then 16 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and 
became one of his victims. 
9. Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
10. An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach 
Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a 
wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's 
plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence 
or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring 
one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally 
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who 
would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per massage session - and 
who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of

improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. 
11. Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at 
Epstein's mansion, the victim would be brought to the kitchen. She would then be led up a flight of 
stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition to other furnishings. Once the girl was 
alone in this room, Epstein would enter wearing only a towel to cover his private area. He then 
would lay down on the massage table and perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, 
including masturbation and touching the girl sexually. 
12. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to 
give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's mansion 
in Palm Beach. Jane was led up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage table. She was 
alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing a towel to cover his private parts. He laid down on 
the massage table, and sexually assaulted Jane Doe during the massage. In addition, Jeffrey Epstein 
masturbated during the massage. 
13. After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to leave 
the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought Jane home. 
Jane was paid $200 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was also paid by Epstein for bringing Jane to him. 
14. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 16-year old Jane experienced trauma, 
shock, confusion, shame, humiliation and embarrassment.

Another suit alleges sex during massage 
By i,ARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Thursday, March 06, 2008 
WEST PALM BEACH — Another woman filed a federal lawsuit against Jeffrey 
Epstein on Wednesday, alleging that he turned a massage she gave him at his Palm 
Beach mansion into a sexual episode when she was 16 years old. 
Identified as Jane Doe No. 3, she is seeking more than $50 million, the same as 
two other Jane Does who filed similar lawsuits in the past six weeks. All three suits were filed by 
Miami lawyer Jeffrey Herman.

Herman subsequently withdrew the first 
Jane Doe's lawsuit because of squabbling 
by her parents over the litigation. The girl 
may refile the suit after she turns 18 in May 
and can make her own decisions, Herman 
said.

In the latest litigation, Jane Doe No. 3 alleges that she was recruited by a former college student, Haley 
Robson, to give Epstein a massage for money at his waterfront home late in 2004 or early in 2005. 
The lawsuit alleges that, while on the massage table, Epstein sexually touched Jane Doe No. 3, then 
masturbated. She is suing on grounds of sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
She felt intimidated. She felt scared, Herman said. Jane Doe No. 3 made only the one visit to Epstein's 
home, he said. 
It's just another copycat lawsuit filed by the same lawyer who appears less interested in the truth than in 
grandstanding with these press conferences, said Jack Goldberger, one of Epstein's attorneys. We now 
have sworn testimony that girls lied about their age to Jeffrey Epstein, and they were careful in being

convincing that they were over the age of 18. 
Herman said Robson instructed Jane Doe No. 3, When he asks how old you are, tell him 18 or 19 years 
old. But he said it doesn't matter. They were underage girls, Herman said. They were sexually 
assaulted. 
In addition to the civil lawsuits, Epstein was indicted on a single count of felony solicitation of 
prostitution in July 2006 after a lengthy Palm Beach Police Department investigation into his activities 
with underage girls at his home. A resolution has been delayed continually. The case is on Monday's 
court docket but is expected to be rescheduled once again. 
One of the reasons (Jane Doe No. 3) came forward is she is tired of waiting for justice, Herman said.

Please accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but I was a little under the weather 
yesterday. I hope that you enjoyed your Thanksgiving. 
Regarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis' selection, I'd like to make a few 
observations. First, Guy Lewis has known for some time that Judge Davis was making 
reasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg for this assignment. In fact, 
when I told you of Judge Davis's selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 2l4, 
you and Professor Dershowitz seemed very comfortable, and certainly not surprised, with the 
selection. Podhurst and Josephsberg are no strangers to nearly the entire Epstein defense team 
including Guy Lewis, Lili Ann Sanchez, Roy Black, and, apparently, Professor Dershowitz who 
said he knew Mr. Josephsberg from law school. Second, Podhurst and Josephsberg have 
long-standing stellar reputations for their legal acumen and ethics. It's hard for me to imagine 
how much more vetting needs to be done. 
The United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of 
the anticipated upcoming events and their rights associated with the agreement entered into by 
the United States and Mr. Epstein in a timely fashion. Tomorrow will make one full week since 
you were formally notified of the selection. I must insist that the vetting process come to an end. 
Therefore, unless you provide me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis's selection by COB 
tomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. Should you give 
me the go-ahead on Podhurst and Josephsberg selection by COB tomorrow, I will simultaneously 
send you a draft of the letter. I intend to notify the victims by letter after COB Thursday, 
November 29'1. Thanks, 
Jeff

Criminal Division

Room 2107 
Washington, DC 20530 
Re: Jeffey Epstein 
Dear Ms. Fisher: 
Facsimile: 
(213) 680-8500 
I represent Jeffrey Epstein, who, as you may be aware, was the target of a dual 
investigation by both state and federal authorities in Florida for acts relating to his interactions 
with numerous young women. As you may also be aware, Mr. Epstein has entered into a 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the Agreement) with the United States Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of Florida (the USAO) to resolve its criminal investigation of him. I run 
writing to. request a meeting with you to discuss certain aspects of this case that I find especially 
troublesome. 
As part of the agreement Mr. Epstein was required to sign to avoid a federal indictment, 
Mr. Epstein was required to waive jurisdiction and liability under 18 U.S.C. §2255 for the 
settlement of monetary claims that might be made by it group of unidentified alleged victims 
who will be identified by the USA() at some point in the future. Neither I, nor any of the other 
defense lawyers involved in this matter, have ever heard of such a procedure. And as part of this 
Agreement, Mr. Epstein is precluded from contesting liability as to civil lawsuits seeking 
monetary compensation for damages brought by any of the identified individuals who elect to 
settle their civil claims for the statutory minimum of either $50,000 (the amount set by Congress 
as of the date of the occurrences) or $150,000 (the amount currently set by statute) or some other 
agreed upon damage amount. We believe that the utilization of 18 U.S.C. § 2255 as a pre-
condition of criminal plea agreements or non-prosecution agreements is highly unusual and 
requires careful consideration and additional guidance by your Office. We also believe that the

Honorable Mice S. Fisher

manner in which the USAO has interpreted the settlement process for these identified individuals 
under the Agreement requires guidance. These areas are more fully detailed below.* 
First. Federal criminal investigators and prosecutors should not be in the business 
of promoting civil lawsuits as a condition precedent to entering non-prosecution or deferred 
prosecution agreements. This is especially true where the vehicle for the financial settlement 
under the Agreement requires payment in a lump sum without requiring proof of actual injury or 
loss — federal authorities should therefore be particularly sensitive to avoid causing a prejudiced 
and unfair result. 18 U.S.C. § 2255 is a civil statute implanted in the criminal code; in contrast to 
all other criminal restitution statutes, § 2255 fails to correlate payments to specific injuries or 
losses. Instead, the statute presumes that victims have sustained damages of at least a minimum 
lump sum without regard to whether the complainants suffered actual medical, psychological or 
other forms of individualized harm. We presume that it is for this reason that 18 U.S.C. § 2255 
has never before been employed in this manner in connection with a non-prosecution or, as here, 
a deferred prosecution agreement. In short, the USAO is operating in uncharted territory. 
Second. 18 U.S.C. § 2255 creates the potential for compromising witness 
testimony. Although generally the Government may promise or provide traditional consideration 
to potential witnesses, employing a civil statute that promises a lump sum payment to potential 
witnesses without proof of actual liability or damage provides an extraordinary incentive that is 
incompatible with the truth-seeking functions of the criminal justice system. Guidelines or other 
policy directives should be considered to control the extent to which witnesses are informed by 
investigators about the availability of such financial windfalls. Additionally, an inquiry is 
necessary in this specific case to assure that disclosures to potential witnesses did not undermine 
the reliability of the results of the federal criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein. 
Third. The USA() has provided no information as to the specific claims made by 
each identified individual, nor were we provided the names or ages of those individuals or the 
time-frame of the alleged conduct The USAO's reluctance to provide Mr. Epstein with any 
information with respect to the allegations against him leaves wide open the opportunity for 
misconduct by federal investigators. In addition, this information vacuum eliminates the ability 
for Mr. Epstein and/or his agents to verify that the allegations at issue are grounded in real 
evidence. Indeed, the requirement that a target of federal criminal prosecution agree to waive his 
right to contest liability as to unnamed civil complainants creates at minimum an appearance of 
injustice, both because of the obvious Due Process concerns of waiving rights without notice of 
* In addition to the areas identified below, it was and remains our position that federal prosecution of this matter is 
entirely inappropriate based on the prior application and legislative histories of the relevant federal statutes.

even the identity of the complainant(s) and because of the involvement of the federal criminal 
justice system in civil settlements between private individuals. 
Fourth. The USA() has improperly insisted that the chosen attorney 
representative should be able to litigate the claims of individuals, which violates the terms of the 
Agreement and deeply infringes upon the spirit and nature of the Agreement. Initially, for the 
sake of expediting a settlement in this matter, we suggested that Mr. Epstein establish a 
restitution fund specifically for the settlement of the identified individuals' civil claims and that 
an impartial, independent representative be appointed to administer that fund. Notably, such a 
restitution fund was created in a federal case, U.S. v. Boehm, Case No. 3:04CR00003 (D Alaska 
2004). The federal prosecutors here rejected this idea, and they insisted that an attorney 
representative, paid for by Mr. Epstein, be appointed. Yet, there was no suggestion at the time 
that the attorney representative's duties included litigating claims on behalf of the identified 
individuals. However, after the parties agreed to the appointment of an attorney representative, 
the prosecutors announced that the criteria for choosing an appropriate attorney representative 
now included that the individual be a plaintiff's lawyer capable of handling multiple lawsuits 
against high profile attorneys. This interpretation of the scope of the attorney representative's 
role is far outside the common understanding that existed when we negotiated Mr. Epstein's 
settlement with the USAO. Furthermore, we firmly believe that ethics rules preclude the 
representative from litigating claims on behalf of the identified individuals. 
In sum, we believe that the actions undertaken in this matter by the USA() with 
respect to the 18 U.S.C. § 2255 provisions of the Agreement are highly unusual. We respectfully 
request a meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the important issues raised by 
the USAO's conduct in this deeply policy-laden matter. 
Sincerely,

Jay, 
You have renewed your request for certain information which this Office does 
not generally make available in similar pre-indictment situations. After 
carefully considering your request, I have decided, in my capacity as the 
First Assistant U.S. Attorney, not to make an exception here. 
Regarding the Landon Thomas matter, Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant to his 
request, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes. 
Regarding the offer to extend the current deadline of March 3, 2008 contained 
in my February 25th email. That offer was based on counsel for Mr. Epstein 
meeting with CEOS the week of March 3rd. You indicate that you are 
unavailable. It is hard to imagine that some or all of the other attorneys 
representing Mr. Epstein cannot serve this function. After all, Mr. Epstein is 
also represented by Dean Kenneth Starr, Martin Weinberg, Roy Black, Gerald 
Lefcourt, Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz, Lily Ann Sanchez, and Guy Lewis. 
That being said, the Southern District of Florida will only renew the offer to 
extend the current deadline if you and the CEOS Section Chief mutually agree 
on a timetable by close of business on Friday, February 29, 2008 to meet and 
complete presentations no later than March 19, 2008. Given that CEOS is ready 
to proceed immediately, this seems like more than ample time. As I indicated 
in my previous email, if CEOS subsequently decides that a federal prosecution 
should not be undertaken against Mr_ Epstein, this Office will close its 
investigation. However, should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein's position, Mr. 
Epstein shall have one week to abide by the terms and conditions of the 
September 24, 2007 Agreement as amended by letter from United States Attorney 
Acosta.

Re: Investigation of Jeffery Epstein 
Dear Mr. Lefkowitz: 
Pursuant to your request and the request of U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta, we have 
independently evaluated certain issues raised in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein to determine 
whether a decision to prosecute Mr. Epstein for federal criminal violations would contradict 
criminal enforcement policy interests. As part of our evaluation, we have reviewed letters 
written on behalf of Mr. Epstein on February 1, 2007, June 25, 2007, July 6, 2007, March 28, 
2008, April 8, 2008, April 28, 2008, and May 14, 2008, with their attachments. We have also 
reviewed memos prepared by the U.S. Attorney's Office. As you will recall, we met with you 
and other representatives of Mr. Epstein to further discuss your views on the propriety of a 
federal prosecution. We have discussed the factual and legal issues you raise with the Criminal 
Division's Appellate Section, and we consulted with the Office of Enforcement Operations 
concerning the petite policy. 
We are examining the narrow question as to whether there is a legitimate basis for the 
U.S. Attorney's Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein. Ultimately, the 
prosecutorial decision making authority within a U.S. Attorney's Office lies with the U.S. 
Attorney. Therefore, to borrow a phrase from the case law, the question we soudit to answer 
was whether U.S. Attorney Acosta would abuse his discretion if he authorized prosecution in this 
case. 
As you know, our review of this case is limited, both factually and legally. We have not 
looked at the entire universe of facts in this case. It is not the role of the Criminal Division to re-
conduct a complete factual inquiry from scratch. Furthermore, we did not analyze any issues 
concerning prosecution under federal statutes that do not pertain to child exploitation, such as the 
money laundering statutes, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012670

Q003 
As was made clear at the outset, we did not review the facts, circumstances, or terms 
included in the plea offer, nor any allegations that individuals involved in the investigation 
engaged in misconduct. Despite that agreement, we note that your letters of April 8, April 28, 
and May 14 focus in large part on accusations of investigative or prosecutorial misconduct. Not 
only do allegations of prosecutorial misconduct fall outside the boundary of our agreed review, 
they also fall outside the authority of the Criminal Division in the first instance. Simply, the 
Criminal Division does not investigate or resolve allegations of professional misconduct by 
federal prosecutors. For these reasons, we do not respond to the portion of those letters that 
discuss alleged misconduct. 
Based on our review of all of these materials, and after careful consideration of the issues, 
we conclude that U.S. Attorney Acosta could properly use his discretion to authorize prosecution 
in this case. We will briefly address each of the issues that you have raised. 
Knowledge of age. Federal child exploitation statutes differ as to whether there must be 
proof that the defendant was aware that the children were under the age of 18. However, even 
for those statutes where knowledge of age is an element of the offense, it is possible to satisfy 
that element with proof that the defendant was deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest 
that the person was a minor. For that reason, the fact that some of the individuals allegedly lied 
to Mr. Epstein about their age is not dispositive of the issue. While there may be an open factual 
issue as to Mr. Epstein's knowledge, we cannot say that it would be impossible to prove 
knowledge of age for any such charges which require it. Therefore, Mr. Acosta could rightfully 
conclude that this factual issue is best resolved by a jury. 
Travel for the purpose. In the materials you prepared, you suggest that Mr. Epstein 
should not be charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 2423(1,) because his dominant purpose in going 
to Florida was not to engage in illegal sexual activity, but rather to return to one of his residences. 
While we fully understand your argument, we also find that the U.S. Attorney's office has a good 
faith basis fully to develop the facts on this issue and brief the law to permit a court to decide 
whether the law properly reaches such conduct. Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his discretion 
if he decided to pursue such a course of action. 
Intent to engage in the conduct at the time of travel, Based on our review of the facts of 
this case, we respectfully disagree that there is no evidence concerning Mr. Epstein's intent when 
he traveled, and when that intent was formed. Should Mr. Acosta elect to let the case proceed so 
that a jury can resolve this factual issue, he would be within his discretion to do so. 
Use of a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce. Much of the materials you 
have prepared and much of the meeting we had focused on 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), specifically your 
contention that Mr. Epstein did not use the phone to coerce anyone to engage in illegal sexual 
activity.. We understand the issue you raise concerning the statutory interpretation. As before, 
however, we cannot agree that there is no evidence that would support a charge under Section 
2422(b), nor can we agree that there is no argument in support of the application of that statute to 
this case. Finally, our assessment is that the application of that statute to these facts would not be 
2 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012671 
05/16/2008 11:16 FAX 
05/16/08 FRI 11:09 FAX 
g1004/006 
0004 
so novel as to implicate the so-called clear statement rule, the Ex Post Facto clause, or the Due 
Process clause. As with the other legal issues, Mr. Acosta may elect to proceed with the case. 
Absence of coercion. With respect to 18 § 1591, the alleged absence of the use of 
force, fraud, or coercion is of no moment. The statute does not require the use of force, fraud, 
and coercion against minors. Because of their age, a degree of coercion is presumed. In your 
materials, you note that the statute requires that the minors must be caused to engage in a 
commercial sex act, further arguing that the word cause suggests that a certain amount of 
undue influence was used. We reject that interpretation, as it would read back into the offense an 
element—coercion—that Congress has expressly excluded. We have successfully prosecuted 
defendants for the commercial sexual exploitation of minors, even when the minors testified that 
not only did they voluntarily engage in the commercial, sex acts, it was their idea to do so. As 
such, Mr. Acosta could properly decide to pursue charges under Section 1591 even if there is no 
evidence of coercion. 
More broadly, a defendant's criminal liability does not hinge on his victim identifying as 
having suffered at his hands. Therefore, a prosecution could proceed, should Mr. Acosta decide 
to do so, even though some of the young women allegedly have said that they do not view 
themselves as victims. 
Witness credibility. As all prosecutors know, there are no perfect witnesses. Particularly 
in cases involving exploited children, as one member of your defense team, Ms. Thacker, surely 
knows from her work at CEOS, it is not uncommon for victim-witnesses to give conflicting 
statements. The prosecutors are in the best position to assess the witness's credibility. Often, the 
prosecutor may decide that the best approach is to present th.e witness, let defense counsel 
explore the credibility problems on cross-examination, and let the jury resolve the issue. Mr. 
Acosta would be within his authority to select that approach, especially when here there are 
multiple, mutually-corroborating witnesses. 
Contradictions and omissions in the search warrant application. We have carefully 
reviewed the factual issues you raise concerning the search warrant application. For a search 
warrant to be suppressed, however, the factual errors must be material, and the officers must not 
have proceeded in good faith. Despite the numerous factual errors you describe, the U.S. 
Attorney's Office could still plausibly argue that the mistakes—whether inadvertent or 
intentional—were not material to the determination that probable cause existed for a search, and 
that the search was in good faith in any event. As such, Mr. Acosta could properly elect to 
defend the search warrant in court rather than forego prosecution. 
Petite 1?olicy: After reviewing the petite policy and consulting with the Office of 
Enforcement Operations (0E0), we conclude that the petite policy does not prohibit federal 
prosecution in this case, According to the U.S. Attorney's Manual, the petite policy applies 
whenever there has been a prior state or federal prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a 
conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, or a dismissal or other termination of

the case on the merits after jeopardy has attached. USAIVI 9-2.031(C). Our understanding is 
that the state case is still pending. As such, tehe procedural posture of the state case does not 
implicate the petite policy. 
We recognize that the petite policy could be triggered if the state case concluded after a 
federal indictment was issued but prior to the commencement of any federal trial. Id. However, 
the policy does not apply ... where the [state] prosecution involved only a minor part of the 
contemplated federal charges. USAM 9-2.031(B). Based on our understanding of the possible 
federal charges and existing state charges, we do not think the petite policy would be an issue 
should federal proceedings take place. 
Federalism and Prosecutorial Discretion. All of the above issues essentially ask whether 
a federal prosecution can proceed. We understand, however, that you also ask whether a federal 
prosecution should proceed, even in the event that all of the elements of a federal offense could 
be proven. On this issue, you raised two arguments: that the conduct at issue here is traditionally 
a state concern because the activity is entirely local, and that the typical prosecution under federal 
child exploitation statutes have different facts than the ones implicated here. You have 
essentially asked us to look into whether a prosecution would so violate federal prosecutorial 
policy that a United States Attorney's Office should not pursue a prosecution. We do not think 
that is the case here for the following reasons. 
Simply, the commercial sexual exploitation of children is a federal concern, even when 
the conduct is local, and regardless of whether the defendant provided the child (the pimp) or 
paid for the child (the `John). In your materials, you refer to a letter sent by the Department of 
Justice to Congress in which the Department expresses concern over the expansion of federal 
laws to reach almost all instances of prostitution. In that portion of the letter, the Department 
was expressly referring to a proposed federal law that reach adult prostitution where no force, 
fraud, or coercion was used. Indeed, the point being made in that letter is that the Department's 
efforts are properly focused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the 
exploitation of adults through the use of force, fraud, or coercion. As such, there is no 
inconsistency between the position taken in that letter and the federal prosecution of wholly local 
instances of the commercial sexual exploitation of children. 
If Congress wanted to limit the reach of federal statutes only to those who profit from the 
commercial sexual exploitation of children, or only to those who actually traffic children across 
state lines, it could have done so. It did not. Finally, that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not 
look precisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive. We can say with confidence 
that this case is consistent in principle with other federal prosecutions nationwide. As such, Mr. 
Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution even though it might 
involve a novel application of a federal statute. 
Conc/usion. After carefully considering all the factual and legal issues raised, as well as 
the arguments concerning the general propriety ()fa federal case against Mr. Epstein on these

facts, we conclude that federal prosecution in this case would not be improper or inappropriate. 
While you raise many compelling arguments, we do not see anything that says to us categorically 
that a federal case should not be brought. Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his prosecutorial 
discretion should he authorize federal prosecution of Mr.. glutei
