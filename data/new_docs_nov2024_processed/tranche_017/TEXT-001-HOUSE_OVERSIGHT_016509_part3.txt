Federal prosecutors focus on other serious direct-victim crimes as well, such as human trafficking and child pornography. See U.S. Dep't of
Justice, supra note 145 (describing prioritization of such cases). But federal involvement in that realm is presumably motivated not so much
by a need for oversight of untrustworthy state prosecutors as by the greater resources, expertise, and interstate jurisdictional advantages that
federal prosecutors bring to such cases. Criminal prosecution is only one aspect of federal policies to reduce custodial deaths and improper
uses of force by police. Other strategies include investigating abuse and corruption in local police agencies and using civil injunctive
remedies against those agencies to change patterns of wrongdoing, as well as gathering data on custodial deaths and police uses of force. See

The clearest historical example would be the post-Reconstruction decades, starting roughly after 1876, when the federal government
retreated from civil rights enforcement in the former Confederate states, including from prosecutions for criminal rights violations and
offenses that states declined to charge, including for homicides. See generally Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution,
1863-1877, at 524-86 (2014) (describing declining enthusiasm for civil rights enforcement and waning Republican political influence in the
South); William Gillette, Retreat from Reconstruction, 1869-1879, at 190-200 (1979) (describing Southern Democrats efforts to resist civil
rights enforcement); George Rutherglen, Civil Rights in the Shadow of Slavery: The Constitution, Common Law, and the Civil Rights Act of

Alaska, Connecticut, and New Jersey do not elect prosecutors. Perry, supra note 122, at 2. Delaware and Rhode Island elect state
attorneys general, whose appointed staff handle all prosecutions. Id. at 11. Except in these jurisdictions, state attorneys general and justice
departments generally have little authority over local prosecutors' offices. Cf. Michael J. Ellis, The Origins of the Elected Prosecutor, 121

A classic account of prosecutors' political influence is William J. Stuntz, The Pathological Politics of Criminal Law, 100 Mich. L. Rev.

expense of judges' sentencing authority, see United States v. Kupa, 976 F. Supp. 2d 417, 419-27 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (describing the legislative

Outside the United States, prosecution agencies are commonly under a politically accountable justice minister or attorney general, whose
political judgment, in principle, operates only at the level of broad policy and should not interfere with specific case decisions. See, e.g.,
Prosecution of Offences Act 1974, § 2(5) (Act No. 22/1974) (Ir.) http:/
/www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1974/act/22/section/2/enacted/en/index.html (The Director [of Public Prosecutions] shall be independent in the

professional, rival, and politically accountable executive branch officials.
The insight of the U.S. approach is that, for many types of [*914] underenforcement, federal oversight combined with
democratically responsive local prosecutors can perform the same function as judicial review and private prosecution of
correcting bad declination decisions driven by institutional allegiances, cultural biases, and favoritism. Politically responsive
criminal justice sometimes works relatively well at changing prosecution practices to serve victim interests that majorities or
strong interest groups embrace. Politics has brought meaningful reforms to prosecution for drunk driving, for example, and it
has led to improvements, if still insufficient ones, regarding domestic violence and sexual assault crimes. But political
accountability has not worked as well to remedy underenforcement when key victim groups have less public sympathy, or key
defendant groups, such as police, have a lot. Redundant prosecution authority, in the form of federal oversight, has a similarly
mixed track record. Federal law has done much to compensate for state underenforcement of public corruption offenses. It has
made significant but less ambitious and successful commitments in the context of police violence. And federal authorities so far
have attempted to reinforce state sexual assault enforcement only at the margins.
The track record of the U.S. responses to underenforcement, then, is mixed. But it is not clear that the alternative safeguards
that predominate elsewhere are, on their own, clearly superior. Private prosecution is little use for victims with few financial
resources or who are legally unsophisticated. Judicial review of declination can be exceedingly deferential, especially if statutes
and regulations do not provide courts with clear criteria against which to assess prosecutorial decision making. Jurisdictions
strongly committed to reducing unjustified declinations would combine most or all of these mechanisms. U.S. jurisdictions
arguably have a history that should have made them especially likely to do so. States once permitted and relied on private
prosecutions; judicial authority to review executive action, outside of prosecutor charging, is at least as robust here as in
England; the movement for crime victim rights was as effective here as anywhere. The failure to devise more comprehensive
safeguards suggests that certain specific pockets of underenforcement - involving police, marginalized victim groups, and
sexual assaults - are especially hard to remedy, regardless of readily available solutions.
