tain general jurisdiction over them, all
claims asserted against those individual
defendants are dismissed for lack of personal
jurisdiction.
3. Plaintiffs Are Entitled to Jurisdictional
Discovery as to Privatbank’s
Investing Activities in the United
States
[37] Plaintiffs point out that Privatbank’s
website and its 2001 Annual Report
state that Privatbank engages in transactions
involving securities issued in the
United States. (2001 Annual Report at 3,
attached to Affidavit of Frances E. Bivens
at Exhibit B). There is no allegation that
transactions are related to the claims asserted
here. Accordingly, they are only
relevant to this Court’s determination of
whether the exercise of general jurisdiction
over Privatbank is warranted pursuant
to Rule 4(k)(2) for having such ‘‘continuous
and systematic general business
contacts’’ with the United States. See
Aerogroup Int’l, Inc., 956 F.Supp. at 439.
Because plaintiffs have identified a genuine
issue of jurisdictional fact, the question
of general jurisdiction cannot be resolved
on the pleadings and affidavits
alone. Thus, plaintiffs are entitled to jurisdictional
discovery regarding the extent
of defendant Privatbank’s general business
contacts with the United States in the
years 1992—1998, a period that includes
the relevant period in this action and five
preceding years. See In re Magnetic Audiotape
Antitrust Litig., 334 F.3d at 207–
08; see also, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 84
F.3d at 569–70 (holding that the time period
relevant for determining extent of a
defendant’s contacts for general jurisdiction
purpose should include a number of
years prior to the events giving rise to the
claims asserted).
IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the
Sovereign defendants’ motion to dismiss is
granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiffs’
claims alleging takings in violation of
international law, promissory estoppel, equitable
estoppel, and unjust enrichment—
counts seven, nine, and ten in the complaint—are
hereby dismissed as against
the Sovereign defendants. In addition, the
motion of individual defendants Horath
and Buchmann to dismiss the complaint
for lack of personal jurisdiction is granted
and all claims asserted against those defendants
are hereby dismissed.
Because this Court finds that an issue of
jurisdictional fact exists as to the existence
of general jurisdiction pursuant to Rule
4(k)(2) as to corporate defendant Privatbank,
its motion to dismiss is denied without
prejudice to its renewal pending conclusion
of jurisdictional discovery on that
issue.

arising from alleged contributions to
charities were barred by discretionary
function exception to torts exception of

contributions were barred by discretionary
function exception to torts
exception of FSIA;
(7) survivors failed to make prima facie
showing necessary to establish personal
jurisdiction over Princes and others
under New York’s long-arm statute;
(8) modified due process standard appropriate
for mass torts would not be
applied to question of personal jurisdiction;
(9) allegations were insufficient to establish
general personal jurisdiction over
Princes;
(10) survivors failed to establish personal
jurisdiction over founder of Saudi
Arabian company;
(11) limited discovery would be permitted
with regard to whether Saudi Arabian
bank’s contacts with United States
were sufficient for exercise of personal
jurisdiction;
(12) survivors failed to establish personal
jurisdiction over director of charity;
(13) jurisdictional discovery was warranted
to determine if Saudi Arabian construction
company purposefully directed
its activities at United States;
(14) jurisdictional discovery was warranted
to determine which of charitable
network’s entities had presence in
Virginia, for purposes of personal jurisdiction;
(15) survivors made prima facie showing
of personal jurisdiction over bank
chairman;
(16) survivors failed to state cause of action
under RICO;
(17) attacks were extreme and outrageous,
as required for intentional infliction of
emotional distress;
IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001
Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)

(18) survivors failed to state cause of action
under ATA against banks; and
(19) survivors stated cause of action
against bank chairman under ATA.
Order accordingly.

3. International Law O10.31
The exceptions to immunity provided

4. International Law O7
A federal court must inquire at the
threshold of every action against a foreign
state whether the exercise of its jurisdiction
is appropriate.
5. International Law O10.38
On a motion to dismiss challenging
subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA),
the defendant must first present a prima

immunity from discovery. 28 U.S.C.A.
§ 1602 et seq.
9. International Law O10.38
In deciding whether a defendant is
entitled to immunity under the Foreign

Saudi Arabia’s ownership of bank was
required to be direct for bank to enjoy

bank would not be immune as instrumentality
of Saudi Arabia if its majority owner,
known as Public Investment Fund (PIF),
was agency, instrumentality, or organ of
Saudi Arabia. 18 U.S.C.A. § 2331 et seq.;

In deciding whether to apply the commercial
activities exception to the Foreign

must inquire whether the foreign state’s
actions are the type of actions by which a
private party engages in trade and traffic
or commerce. 28 U.S.C.A. § 1605(a)(2).
15. International Law O10.33
To extent that Antiterrorism Act
(ATA) claims against Saudi Arabia and
two of its government officials by survivors
of victims of September 11, 2001 attacks
were based on defendants’ alleged contributions
to charities, those alleged acts
were not commercial and thus were not
subject to commercial activities exception
of Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
(FSIA), even if alleged acts constituted
money laundering. 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1956,
2331 et seq.; 28 U.S.C.A. § 1605(a)(2).
16. International Law O10.33

22. Conspiracy O1.1
Torts O21
In New York, conspiracy and aiding
and abetting are varieties of concerted action
liability, for which there must be: (1)
an express or tacit agreement to participate
in a common plan or design to commit
a tortious act; (2) tortious conduct by each
defendant; and (3) the commission by one
of the defendants, in pursuance of the
agreement, of an act that constitutes a
tort.
23. Conspiracy O2
Under New York law, liability for conspiracy
requires an agreement to commit a
tortious act.
24. Torts O21
Under New York law, aiding and
abetting liability requires that the defendant
have given substantial assistance or
encouragement to the primary wrongdoer.
25. International Law O10.43
Antiterrorism Act (ATA) complaint by
survivors of victims of September 11, 2001

to charities that supported al
Qaeda, and that al Qaeda repeatedly and
publicly targeted United States, failed to
allege causal connection sufficient to satisfy
New York standard for concerted action
liability, for purposes of torts exception of
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act

could be inferred that Princes knew charities
were fronts for al Qaeda. 18 U.S.C.A.

26. International Law O10.43
To allege a causal connection sufficient
to invoke the torts exception of the

in connection with a defendant’s contributions
to organizations that are not themselves
designated terrorists, there must be
some facts presented to support the allegation
that the defendant knew the receiving
organization to be a solicitor, collector,
supporter, front or launderer for such an
entity; there must be some facts to support
an inference that the defendant knowingly
provided assistance or encouragement to
the wrongdoer. 28 U.S.C.A. § 1605(a)(5).

contacts with that forum, while ‘‘general
jurisdiction’’ is based on the defendant’s
general business contacts with the forum;
because the defendant’s contacts are not
related to the suit, a considerably higher
level of contacts is generally required for
general jurisdiction. U.S.C.A. Const.

53. Constitutional Law O305(5)
In determining whether the exercise
of personal jurisdiction is reasonable under
the Due Process Clause, a court is to
consider: (1) the burden that the exercise
of jurisdiction will impose on the defendant;
(2) the interests in the forum state
in adjudicating the case; (3) the plaintiff’s
interest in obtaining convenient and effective
relief; (4) the interstate judicial system’s
interest in obtaining the most efficient
resolution of the controversy; and (5)
the shared interest of the states in furthering
substantive social policies. U.S.C.A.
Const.Amends. 5, 14.

55. Federal Civil Procedure O1267.1
In evaluating jurisdictional motions,
district courts enjoy broad discretion in
deciding whether to order discovery.
56. Federal Civil Procedure O1269.1
Courts are not obligated to subject a
foreign defendant to discovery where the
allegations of jurisdictional facts, construed
in plaintiffs’ favor, fail to state a
basis for the exercise of jurisdiction or
where discovery would not uncover sufficient
facts to sustain jurisdiction.

Allegations that Saudi Royal Family
members owned substantial assets in and
did substantial business in United States,
and used profits therefrom to fund international
terrorist acts, including those

To state cause of action under Antiterrorism
Act (ATA) pursuant to conspiracy
theory, survivors of victims of September

In New York, a plaintiff may establish
negligent infliction of emotional distress
under the bystander or direct duty theory.
87. Damages O57.27
Under the bystander theory for proving
negligent infliction of emotional distress
under New York law, a defendant’s
conduct is negligent as creating an unreasonable
risk of bodily harm to a plaintiff,
and such conduct is a substantial factor in
bringing about injuries to the plaintiff in
consequence of shock or fright resulting
from his or her contemporaneous observation
of serious physical injury or death
inflicted by the defendant’s conduct on a
member of the plaintiff’s immediate family
in his or her presence.

To establish a claim for negligence
under New York law, a plaintiff must show
that the defendant owed the plaintiff a
cognizable duty of care, that the defendant
breached that duty, and that the plaintiff
suffered damages as a proximate cause of
that breach.
90. Negligence O210
The most basic element of a negligence
claim under New York law is the
existence of a duty owed to plaintiffs by
defendants.

they failed to allege or identify duty owed
to them by defendants.
93. War and National Emergency O50
In light of extreme nature of charge of
terrorism, fairness required extra-careful
scrutiny of allegations by survivors of victims
of September 11, 2001 attacks as to
any particular defendant, to ensure that
he, or it, had fair notice of claims, including
claims under Antiterrorism Act (ATA).

no facts to support conclusion that
bank knew of charities’ alleged support for
terrorism, and failed to allege relationship

Opinion and Order
CASEY, District Judge.
On September 11, 2001, nineteen members
of the al Qaeda terrorist network
hijacked four United States passenger airplanes
and flew them into the twin towers
of the World Trade Center in New York
City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia,
and—due to passengers’ efforts to foil the
hijackers—an open field in Shanksville,
Pennsylvania. Thousands of people on the
planes, in the buildings, and on the ground
were killed in those attacks, countless others
were injured, and billions of dollars of
property was destroyed.
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, on December
9, 2003 the Multidistrict Litigation
Panel centralized six then-pending September
11–related cases before this Court
‘‘for coordinated or consolidated pretrial
proceedings.’’ Additional actions, that are
not the subject of this opinion, have since
been filed. Plaintiffs in these consolidated
actions are more than three thousand survivors,
family members, and representatives
of victims, and insurance carriers
seeking to hold responsible for the attacks
the persons and entities that supported
and funded al Qaeda. The complaints al-
780 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES
lege that over two hundred defendants
directly or indirectly provided material
support to Osama bin Laden and the al
Qaeda terrorists. Generally, these defendants
fall into one of several categories: al
Qaeda and its members and associates;
state sponsors of terrorism; and individuals
and entities, including charities, banks,
front organizations, terrorist organizations,
and financiers who provided financial, logistical,
and other support to al Qaeda. 1
See, e.g., Ashton Complaint ¶ 5; Burnett
Complaint ‘‘Introduction’’; Federal Complaint
¶¶ 42–66. The complaints assert
subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act (‘‘FSIA’’),
28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq.; and causes of
action under the Torture Victim Protection
Act (‘‘TVPA’’), 28 U.S.C. § 1350 note; the
Antiterrorism Act (‘‘ATA’’), 18 U.S.C.
1. According to Plaintiffs, Osama bin Laden
formed al Qaeda, which means ‘‘the Base’’ or
‘‘the Vanguard,’’ into an international terrorist
organization with the aim of violently opposing
non-Islam governments and Islamic
states too beholden to the West. See, e.g.,
Burnett Complaint at 275.
2. Before the Multidistrict Panel transferred
Burnett v. Al Baraka Inv. & Dev. Corp., 02 Civ.
1616, to this Court, Judge Robertson of the
United States District Court for the District of
Columbia dismissed the claims against Prince
Sultan relating to acts performed in his official
capacity for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
Burnett v. Al Baraka Inv. & Dev.
Corp., 292 F.Supp.2d 9, 23 (D.D.C.2003)
(hereinafter ‘‘Burnett II ’’). Finding that the
court lacked personal jurisdiction over Prince
Sultan, Judge Robertson dismissed without
prejudice the allegations concerning acts taken
in his personal, as opposed to official,
capacity. Id. Judge Robertson dismissed the
complaint against Prince Turki for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction as well. Id.
Prince Sultan and Prince Turki both move
to dismiss the complaints against them in
Ashton v. Al Qaeda Islamic Army, 02 Civ.
6977 (S.D.N.Y.); Barrera v. Al Qaeda Islamic
Army, 03 Civ. 7036 (S.D.N.Y.); Burnett v. Al
Baraka Inv. & Dev. Corp., 02 Civ. 1616
(D.D.C.); Burnett v. Al Baraka Inv. & Dev.
§ 2331 et seq.; the Alien Tort Claims Act
(‘‘ATCA’’), 28 U.S.C. § 1350; the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (‘‘RICO’’), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq.;
theories of aiding and abetting, conspiracy,
intentional infliction of emotional distress,
negligence, survival, wrongful death, trespass,
and assault and battery.
[1] Several motions to dismiss are
pending before the Court. At the suggestion
of counsel, the Court scheduled oral
arguments in groups organized generally
by grounds for dismissal. On September
14, 2004, the Court heard oral argument
on the motions to dismiss for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction under the FSIA by
HRH Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al–Saud
(‘‘Prince Sultan’’), HRH Prince Turki Al–
Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al–Saud (‘‘Prince
Turki’’), 2 and the National Commercial
Corp., 03 Civ. 5738 (S.D.N.Y.); Salvo v. Al
Qaeda Islamic Army, 03 Civ. 5071 (S.D.N.Y.);
and Tremsky v. Osama bin Laden, 02 Civ.
7300 (S.D.N.Y.). Plaintiffs in these cases filed
consolidated responses to Prince Sultan’s and
Prince Turki’s motions. In Plaintiffs’ words,
the New York Burnett action is materially
identical to the D.C. Burnett action and was
filed as a ‘‘prophylactic’’ measure in the event
the D.C. court found that it lacked subject
matter jurisdiction. Burnett Complaint at
265. Additionally, at Plaintiffs’ counsel request,
this Court ordered the Barrera action
consolidated with the Ashton case on December
6, 2004.
Prince Sultan and Prince Turki have each
also filed a separate motion to dismiss in
Federal Insurance v. Al Qaida, 03 Civ. 6978
(S.D.N.Y.), both of which are fully submitted
and are resolved in this opinion. The Federal
Insurance Plaintiffs are forty-one insurance
companies that have paid and reserved claims
in excess of $4.5 billion as a result of the
September 11 attacks.
The Burnett Plaintiffs filed a motion for
reconsideration in conjunction with Prince
Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s motions to dismiss
certain consolidated complaints. While
this Court reviews and gives deference to
Judge Robertson’s thoughtful opinion, it must
evaluate Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s

November 5, 2004, when the Court heard
oral argument from the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia in its motion to dismiss the Federal
Insurance complaint. 15
I. Subject Matter Jurisdiction Under
the FSIA
[2–4] Under the FSIA, a foreign state
and its instrumentalities are presumed immune
from United States courts’ jurisdiction.
Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U.S.
349, 355, 113 S.Ct. 1471, 123 L.Ed.2d 47
(1993); 28 U.S.C. §§ 1602–1607. The
FSIA’s exceptions to immunity provide the
sole basis for obtaining subject matter jurisdiction
over a foreign state and its instrumentalities
in federal court. Argentine
Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping
Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 439, 109 S.Ct. 683, 102
L.Ed.2d 818 (1989); Robinson v. Gov’t of
Malaysia, 269 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir.2001).
Federal courts must inquire at the
‘‘threshold of every action’’ against a foreign
state whether the exercise of its jurisdiction
is appropriate. Verlinden B.V. v.
Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 493,
103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983).
A. Standard of Review
[5, 6] In a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss
challenging subject matter jurisdiction
under the FSIA, ‘‘the defendant must
first ‘present a prima facie case that it is a
foreign sovereign.’ ’’ Virtual Countries v.
Republic of South Africa, 300 F.3d 230,
241 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting Cargill Int’l
S.A. v. M/T Pavel Dybenko, 991 F.2d
1012, 1016 (2d Cir.1993)). In response,
the plaintiff must present evidence that
one of the statute’s exceptions nullifies the
immunity. Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at
241 (‘‘Determining whether this burden is
met involves a ‘review of the allegations in
the complaint, the undisputed facts, if any,
placed before the court by the parties,
and—if the plaintiff comes forward with
sufficient evidence to carry its burden of
production on this issue—resolution of disputed
issues of fact.’ ’’) (citing Robinson,
269 F.3d at 141); Leutwyler v. Office of
Her Majesty Queen Rania Al–Abdullah,
184 F.Supp.2d 277, 287 (S.D.N.Y.2001)
(explaining plaintiff may ‘‘rebut the presumption
of immunity TTT by proffering
evidence of record that the defendant undertook
certain activities that fall within
the scope’’ of one of the statutory exceptions)
(citing Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc. v. Comm. of Receivers for
A.W. Galadari, 12 F.3d 317, 325 (2d Cir.
1993)). In challenging this Court’s subject
matter jurisdiction, the moving Defendants
retain the ultimate burden of persuasion.
Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at
241 (citing Cargill, 991 F.2d at 1016);
Robinson, 269 F.3d at 141 n. 8 (noting
defendant’s burden must be met with a
preponderance of the evidence).
[7] Defendants may ‘‘challenge either
the legal or factual sufficiency of the plaintiff’s
assertion of jurisdiction, or both.’’
Robinson, 269 F.3d at 140 (citations omitted).
‘‘If the defendant challenges only
the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff’s jurisdictional
allegations, the court must take
all facts alleged in the complaint as true
and draw all reasonable inferences in favor
of the plaintiff.’’ Id. (internal quotations
and citations omitted); Sweet v. Sheahan,
235 F.3d 80, 83 (2d Cir.2000). ‘‘But where
evidence relevant to the jurisdictional
question is before the court, ‘the district
court TTT may refer to that evidence.’ ’’
Robinson, 269 F.3d at 140 (quoting Makarova
v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113
(2d Cir.2000)); see also Filetech S.A. v.
France Telecom S.A., 157 F.3d 922, 932
15. The parties have agreed that resolution of
this motion will also apply to Vigilant Insurance
v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 03 Civ.
8591(RCC).
IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001
Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)
783
(2d Cir.1998) (explaining, where there are
factual disputes regarding the immunity
question, the court may not ‘‘accept the
mere allegations of the complaint as a
basis for finding subject matter jurisdiction’’).
Thus, ‘‘on a ‘challenge to the district
court’s subject matter jurisdiction, the
court may resolve disputed jurisdictional
fact issues by reference to evidence outside
the pleadings, such as affidavits.’ ’’
Filetech, 157 F.3d at 932 (explaining a
court should consider all the submissions
of the parties and may, if necessary, hold
an evidentiary hearing to resolve the jurisdictional
question) (quoting Antares Aircraft,
L.P. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria,
948 F.2d 90, 96 (2d Cir.1991)). The court
must consult outside evidence if resolution
of a proffered factual issue may result in
the dismissal of the complaint for lack of
jurisdiction. Robinson, 269 F.3d at 141 n.
6. Defendants here challenge both the legal
and factual sufficiency of Plaintiffs’
claims. The Court will consider the affidavits
submitted by the parties as necessary.
[8] Before turning to the allegations
against the Defendants claiming immunity,
the Court notes it is keenly aware of the
‘‘delicate balanc[e] ‘between permitting
discovery to substantiate exceptions to
statutory foreign sovereign immunity and
protecting a sovereign’s or sovereign’s
agency’s legitimate claim to immunity from
discovery.’ ’’ First City, Texas–Houston,
N.A. v. Rafidain Bank, 150 F.3d 172, 176
(2d Cir.1998) (ordering full discovery
against defendant over whom court already
had subject matter jurisdiction because
such discovery would provide plaintiff
an opportunity to obtain jurisdictional
discovery regarding potentially sovereign
alter ego co-defendant without further impinging
that defendant’s immunity) (quoting
Arriba Ltd. v. Petroleos Mexicanos,
962 F.2d 528, 534 (5th Cir.1992) (‘‘At the
very least, discovery should be ordered
circumspectly and only to verify allegations
of specific facts crucial to an immunity
determination.’’)). The Second Circuit
has instructed ‘‘that generally a plaintiff
may be allowed limited discovery with respect
to the jurisdictional issue; but until
[plaintiff] has shown a reasonable basis for
assuming jurisdiction, she is not entitled to
any other discovery.’’ First City, 150 F.3d
at 176–77 (quoting Filus v. Lot Polish
Airlines, 907 F.2d 1328, 1332 (2d Cir.
1990)). Still, the Plaintiffs must allege
sufficient facts to warrant jurisdictional
discovery. Robinson, 269 F.3d at 146 (citing
Jazini v. Nissan Motor Co., 148 F.3d
181, 185 (2d Cir.1998) (refusing jurisdictional
discovery where plaintiffs’ allegations
lacked factual specificity to confer
jurisdiction)); see also Burnett II, 292
F.Supp.2d at 15 (denying Plaintiffs’ request
for discovery from Prince Turki
where ‘‘suggestions of [his] individual activity
are only conclusory’’).
B. Allegations Against Defendants
Asserting Foreign Sovereign Immunity
1. Prince Sultan
Prince Sultan has been Saudi Arabia’s
Minister of Defense and Aviation and Inspector
General of its Armed Forces since
1962. Ashton Complaint ¶ 265; Burnett
Complaint ¶ 352; Federal Complaint ¶ 427;
William H. Jeffress, Jr. Decl. ¶ 4 at Notice
of HRH Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Al–
Saud’s Motion to Dismiss Consolidated

Decl.’’); Andrea Bierstein Aff. in

Saud named him Second Deputy President
of Saudi Arabia’s Council of Ministers, the
Kingdom’s governing body. Nizar Bin

Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz al-Saud’s Motion
to Dismiss Certain Consolidated Complaints
Ex. 1 (hereinafter ‘‘Nadani Decl.’’);
Consolidated Jeffress Decl. ¶ 4; Federal
Complaint ¶ 427; Sultan Bio. As such, he
is the third-highest ranking member of the
Saudi government.
Especially relevant here, Prince Sultan
is the Chairman of the Supreme Council of
Islamic Affairs, which was established in
1995 and is responsible for the Kingdom’s
Islamic policy abroad. Consolidated Jeffress
Decl. ¶ 5; Ashton Complaint ¶ 265;
Federal Complaint ¶ 427. Prince Sultan
disagrees with Plaintiffs’ claim that the
Supreme Council monitors and approves
domestic and foreign charitable giving on
behalf of the Kingdom. Prince Sultan prefers
the characterization that the Supreme
Council ‘‘carr[ies] out the foreign policy of
Saudi Arabia as determined by the Council
of Ministers.’’ Abdulaziz H. Al–Fahad
Decl. ¶ 5, at Sara E. Kropf Decl. Ex. 2.
Finally, Prince Sultan, as the head of the
Special Committee of the Council of Ministers,
which is a foreign policy advisory
resource for King Saud, exercises authority
over disbursements by the Special Committee.
Consolidated Jeffress Decl. ¶ 6. In
the past, these disbursements, which are
government funded, have included grants
to Islamic charities. Id. at ¶ 6.
The various complaints make substantially
similar accusations against Prince
Sultan. See Consolidated Jeffress Decl.
16. IIRO is allegedly an al Qaeda front that
has been tied to the 1993 World Trade Center
attack and the 1998 embassy bombings. See,
e.g., Burnett Complaint ¶¶ 156, 240, 242.
17. Beginning in 2002, certain branches of Al
Haramain were designated by the United
States as terrorist organizations. See Exec.
Order No. 13224, 31 C.F.R. 595, available at
http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/sanctions/t11ter.pdf
(hereinafter
‘‘Exec. Order No. 13224’’). Judge Robertson
Ex. C (summarizing allegations against
Prince Sultan in consolidated complaints).
Prince Sultan is alleged to have met with
Osama bin Laden after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in the summer of 1990. Ashton Complaint
¶ 253; Burnett Complaint ¶ 340. At
that meeting, which Prince Turki also attended,
bin Laden purportedly offered his
family’s support to Saudi military forces.
Ashton Complaint ¶ 253. Plaintiffs allege
that, at the time of the Gulf War, Prince
Sultan ‘‘took radical stands against western
countries and publicly supported and
funded several Islamic charities that were
sponsoring Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda
operations.’’ Ashton Complaint ¶ 266;
Burnett Complaint ¶ 353. After the attacks
of September 11, Prince Sultan allegedly
advocated against granting the United
States use of Saudi military bases to
stage attacks against Afghanistan. Ashton
Complaint ¶ 273; Burnett Complaint
¶ 356.
Prince Sultan allegedly made personal
contributions, totaling $6,000,000 since
1994, to various Islamic charities that
Plaintiffs claim sponsor or support al Qaeda.
Ashton Complaint ¶ 269; Burnett
Complaint ¶ 359; Federal Complaint ¶ 430.
The specific charities that Prince Sultan
donated to include Defendants International
Islamic Relief Organization (‘‘IIRO’’), 16
Al Haramain, 17 Muslim World League
(‘‘MWL’’), 18 and the World Assembly of
Muslim Youth (‘‘WAMY’’). 19 Ashton Com-
denied Al Haramain’s motion to dismiss the
Burnett action. Burnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at
107.
18. MWL is the parent of IIRO. See, e.g., Burnett
Complaint ¶ 236.
19. WAMY is a suspected al Qaeda front, allegedly
‘‘preaching good TTT while plotting evil,’’
connected to charity Defendant Benevolence
International Foundation (‘‘BIF’’). BIF is
now a designated terrorist, but it previously
concealed its relationship with Osama bin

plaint ¶¶ 269–272; Burnett Complaint
¶¶ 354, 359; Federal Complaint ¶ 430. According
to Plaintiffs, with respect to his
alleged donations, ‘‘[a]t best, Prince Sultan
was grossly negligent in the oversight and
administration of charitable funds, knowing
they would be used to sponsor international
terrorism, but turning a blind eye.
At worse, Prince Sultan directly aided and
abetted and materially sponsored al Qaeda
and international terrorism.’’ Burnett
Complaint ¶ 363; Federal Complaint
¶¶ 429–31 (alleging Prince Sultan knew
and intended that the contributions he
made to various charities would be used to
fund al Qaeda and international terrorism).
20
Laden and al Qaeda. See, e.g., Burnett Complaint
¶¶ 160, 205, 229, 362; Exec. Order
13224.
20. Prince Sultan denies making any grants to
Al Haramain and MWL and argues that contributions
made to IIRO and WAMY were
made strictly in his official capacity on behalf
of the Saudi government. Further, he claims
the four charities searched their records and
confirmed that Prince Sultan did not make
any personal contributions. These transmittal
letters and government checks were included
in Prince Sultan’s motion to dismiss the D.C.
Burnett action. Judge Robertson found these
documents had ‘‘limited probative value, [as
they] lack[ed] proper foundations to establish
that the affiants could have known the actual
source of the moneys they received.’’ Burnett
2. Prince Turki
Prince Turki is currently the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United
Kingdom. Ashton Complaint ¶ 263.
From 1977 until August 2001, he was the
Director of Saudi Arabia’s Department of
General Intelligence (‘‘DGI,’’ also known
by its Arabic name, Istakhbarat). Ashton
Complaint ¶ 255; Burnett Complaint ¶ 343;
Federal Complaint ¶ 445. As such, Plaintiffs
allege he was or should have been
aware of the terrorist threat posed by
Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and the Taliban.
Ashton Complaint ¶ 256; Burnett
Complaint ¶ 343. Prince Turki allegedly
met with Osama bin Laden five times in
the mid–1980s and mid–1990s. Ashton
Complaint ¶ 257; Burnett Complaint ¶ 344.
At one of those meetings, which Prince
Sultan also attended, bin Laden allegedly
offered the Saudis the use of his family’s
engineering equipment and suggested bolstering
Saudi military forces with militants.
Ashton Complaint ¶ 253. Prince
Turki is alleged to have close ties with an
al Qaeda financier, Mr. Zouaydi, and is
allegedly implicated in Mr. Zouaydi’s financial
support of al Qaeda. Ashton Complaint
¶ 241; Burnett Complaint ¶ 345.
Further, Plaintiffs claim Prince Turki met
with members of the Taliban and, in 1995,
gave the Taliban financial and material
support. Ashton Complaint ¶ 257; Federal
Complaint ¶¶ 447–48 (alleging that, at
the time Prince Turki provided support,
the Taliban maintained a symbiotic relationship
with al Qaeda and thus Prince
Turki knew al Qaeda would benefit from
the Kingdom’s support). In July 1998,
Prince Turki is alleged to have met with
members of the Taliban and representatives
of bin Laden and agreed to not extradite
bin Laden or close terrorist camps in
exchange for bin Laden’s protection of the
II, 292 F.Supp.2d at 16. This Court has reviewed
these affidavits and agrees with Judge
Robertson’s assessment. For example, one
declarant who provided information regarding
alleged contributions relied on his personal
knowledge of a charity’s records, yet he
had only been in his position for two months.
See Decl. of Saleh Abdullah Al Saykhan ¶ 2, at
Decl. of Sara E. Kropf in Support of Prince
Sultan’s Motion to Dismiss the D.C. Burnett
action. As Judge Robertson pointed out, ‘‘the
value of plaintiffs’ showing that Prince Sultan
did give money to these organizations in his
personal capacity, however, is no greater.’’
Burnett II, 292 F.Supp.2d at 16 (referring to
Saudi press reports of Prince Sultan’s contributions).
786 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES
Saudi Royal family. Ashton Complaint
¶ 261; Burnett Complaint ¶ 348. Plaintiffs
allege Prince Turki facilitated money
transfers from wealthy Saudis to the Taliban
and al Qaeda. Ashton Complaint
¶ 259; Federal ¶ 451. Additionally, the
Federal Plaintiffs claim that, while Prince
Turki was the head of DGI, Saudi Arabian
intelligence officers allegedly trained a
member of the al Qaeda Spanish cell in
explosives and provided material support
to two of the September 11 hijackers.
Federal Complaint ¶ 449. The Federal
complaint also alleges that Prince Turki
made personal contributions to Saudibased
charities that he knew were sponsors
of al Qaeda, including IIRO, MWL,
WAMY, BIF, the Saudi High Commission,
Saudi Joint Relief Committee for Kosovo
and Chechnya (‘‘SJRC’’), and Al Haramain.
Federal Complaint ¶¶ 451–52.
[9] Prince Turki denies the allegations
against him in a declaration prepared in
concert with his motion to dismiss the D.C.
Burnett action. In reviewing this declaration,
the Court gives ‘‘great weight to any
extrinsic submissions made by the foreign
defendant[ ] regarding the scope of [his]
official responsibilities.’’ Leutwyler, 184
F.Supp.2d at 287 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Prince Turki explains that the
DGI ‘‘is involved in the collection and analysis
of foreign intelligence and in carrying
out foreign operations.’’ Decl. of HRH
Prince Turki ¶ 5, at HRH Prince Turki’s
Motion to Dismiss Certain Consolidated
Complaints Ex. 1 (hereinafter ‘‘Prince
Turki Decl.’’). He was active in Saudi
Arabia’s efforts to combat terrorism generally
and the threat posed by Osama bin
Laden and al Qaeda specifically, and
served on a joint information-sharing committee
with the United States beginning in
1997. Id. ¶¶ 6, 10. He states that all of
his interactions with Osama bin Laden and
the Taliban were part of his official functions.
Id. ¶ 5. In June 1998, King Fahd
sent Prince Turki to Kandahar to meet
with the Taliban and to relay the official
Saudi request that Osama bin Laden be
extradited to Saudi Arabia for trial. Id.
¶ 11. The Taliban denied the Saudi request
and Saudi Arabia subsequently suspended
diplomatic relations with the Taliban
in September 1998. Id. ¶ 13. Prince
Turki denies facilitating money transfers
to Osama bin Laden or al Qaeda, he denies
offering material assistance to Osama bin
Laden, his representatives, or al Qaeda in
return for their not attacking Saudi Arabia,
he denies promising or providing oil or
financial assistance to the Taliban, and denies
ever hearing of the Syrian financier
Mr. Zouaydi, with whom he is alleged to
have ties. Id. ¶¶ 14, 16, 17.
3. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
The Federal Plaintiffs claim that ‘‘[m]ore
than any other factor, al Qaida’s phenomenal
growth and development into a sophisticated
global terrorist network were made
possible by the massive financial, logistical
and other support it received from the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, members of the
Saudi Royal family, and prominent members
of Saudi society.’’ Federal Complaint
¶ 398. Further, the Federal Plaintiffs allege
September 11 was ‘‘a direct, intended
and foreseeable product of the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia’s participation in al Qaida’s
jihadist campaign.’’ Id. ¶ 425. Specifically,
the Kingdom allegedly maintained and
controlled several of the charities within al
Qaeda’s infrastructure. Id. ¶ 399. The
Federal Plaintiffs claim Saudi Arabia knew
the threat that these charities posed particularly
to the United States, and did
nothing to stop it. Id. ¶¶ 400–02. The
Kingdom allegedly used its relationship
with the Taliban to sustain al Qaeda in the
mid–1990s. Id. ¶¶ 403, 407. To the extent
the Federal Plaintiffs rely on actions by
members of the Saudi Royal family as
allegations against the Kingdom, they
IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001
Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)
787
make no claim that these individuals were
acting on behalf of or at the behest of the
Kingdom. See, e.g., id. ¶ 420 (claiming
that in January 1999 Princess Haifa made
payments to Al–Bayoumi, a Defendant alleged
to have paid rent on behalf of two of
the hijackers). Finally, Plaintiffs allege
that members of the Saudi Royal family
provided support to al Qaeda in their official
capacities as members of the Supreme
Council of Islamic Affairs. Federal Complaint
¶¶ 426–464.
21. The Ashton Plaintiffs moved to amend this
allegation to claim that the Public Investment
Fund (‘‘PIF’’), not the Saudi government, purchased
a majority of NCB shares in 1999.
Ashton Docket ## 137, 138.
4. National Commercial Bank
NCB was established in 1950 by Salim
bin Mahfouz, the father of Defendant
Khalid bin Mahfouz, as the first commercial
bank of Saudi Arabia. Ashton Complaint
¶ 563; Burnett Complaint ¶ 88. The
Ashton Plaintiffs allege that the bin Mahfouz
family controlled NCB until 1999
when the Saudi government bought a majority
of its shares. Ashton Complaint
¶ 573. 21 The Ashton and Burnett Plaintiffs
claim that NCB has a wholly-owned subsidiary
in New York, SNCB Securities,
Ltd., through which it operates an international
banking business. Ashton Complaint
¶ 563; Burnett Complaint ¶ 88.
Plaintiffs claim Osama bin Laden and al
Qaeda used NCB as ‘‘a financial arm, operating
as a financial conduit for [their] operations.’’
Ashton Complaint ¶ 564; Burnett
Complaint ¶ 89. In 1986, Khalid bin Mahfouz
became NCB’s President and CEO
and remained so until 1999. Ashton Complaint
¶ 563; Burnett Complaint ¶ 88.
Also in 1986, Khalid bin Mahfouz became
the Chief Operating Officer and a major
shareholder of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (‘‘BCCI’’). Ashton
Complaint ¶¶ 564, 566; Burnett Complaint
¶¶ 89, 91. He was subsequently indicted
in New York state in connection
with his involvement in BCCI’s fraudulent
practices, which also implicated NCB. Ashton
Complaint ¶¶ 564, 566; Burnett Complaint
¶¶ 89, 91.
Plaintiffs claim both NCB and BCCI
supported international terrorism. Ashton
Complaint ¶¶ 564–68; Burnett Complaint
¶¶ 91–93. Specifically, a ‘‘1999 United
States Senate Report on the BCCI scheme
detailed the role of [NCB] in hiding assets,
money laundering, the cover-up and obstruction
of a Senate investigation, and
sponsoring international terrorism.’’ Burnett
Complaint ¶ 89. Additionally, a 1998
NCB bank audit revealed irregularities involving
direct donations to several charities
and that $74 million had been funneled
by the bank’s Zakat Committee to IIRO. 22
Ashton Complaint ¶¶ 569–71; Burnett
¶¶ 94, 95. NCB also allegedly made loans
to charitable organizations without the
knowledge of the Zakat Committee. Id.
Plaintiffs allege ‘‘direct donations were received
through NCB facilities to the Red
Crescent Committee, [IIRO], and the Muwaffaq
Foundation,’’ all Defendants in
these actions. Ashton Complaint ¶ 570;
Burnett Complaint ¶ 95. Muwaffaq allegedly
provided Osama bin Laden with $3
million in 1998. Ashton Complaint ¶ 573.
Plaintiffs claim NCB knew or should have
known it was materially supporting al Qaeda,
Osama bin Laden, and international
terrorism. Ashton Complaint ¶ 570; Burnett
Complaint ¶ 95.

States for FSIA Purposes
The Court must first determine if the
moving Defendants are ‘‘foreign states’’ for

See, e.g., Burnett Complaint at 275; id.

purposes of the FSIA. A ‘‘foreign state’’ is
statutorily defined:
(a) A ‘‘foreign state’’ TTT includes a political
subdivision of a foreign state or an
agency or instrumentality of a foreign
state as defined in subsection (b).
(b) An ‘‘agency or instrumentality of a
foreign state’’ means any entity -
(1) which is a separate legal person,
corporate or otherwise, and
(2) which is an organ of a foreign
state or political subdivision thereof,
or a majority of whose shares or other
ownership interest is owned by a foreign
state or political subdivision
thereof, and
(3) which is neither a citizen of a
State of the United States TTT nor
created under the laws of any third
country.
28 U.S.C. § 1603. There is no dispute
that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a
foreign state. The status of each of the
Princes and NCB are discussed below.
1. Prince Sultan and Prince Turki
Several courts have recognized that
‘‘[i]mmunity under the FSIA extends also
to agents of a foreign state acting in their
official capacities [since] ‘[i]t is generally
recognized that a suit against an individual
acting in his official capacity is the practical
equivalent of a suit against the sovereign
directly.’ ’’ 23 Bryks v. Canadian
Broad. Corp., 906 F.Supp. 204, 210
(S.D.N.Y.1995) (quoting Chuidian v. Philippine
Nat’l Bank, 912 F.2d 1095, 1101
(9th Cir.1990) (‘‘Nowhere in the text or
legislative history does Congress state that
individuals are not encompassed within 28
U.S.C. § 1603(b).’’)); see also Velasco v.
Gov’t of Indonesia, 370 F.3d 392, 398–99
(4th Cir.2004) (collecting cases extending
23. The FSIA is silent on the subject. Neither
the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit
FSIA immunity to individuals sued in their
official capacities); Byrd v. Corporacion
Forestal y Industrial de Olancho S.A., 182
F.3d 380, 388 (5th Cir.1999) (acknowledging
the FSIA protects individuals to
the extent they act within their official
duties); El–Fadl v. Cent. Bank of Jordan,
75 F.3d 668, 671 (D.C.Cir.1996) (dismissing
claims against government officials since
they were sued in their official capacities);
Leutwyler, 184 F.Supp.2d at 286–87 (‘‘[I]t
has been generally recognized that individuals
employed by a foreign state’s agencies
or instrumentalities are deemed ‘foreign
states’ when they are sued for actions undertaken
within the scope of their official
capacities.’’) (citing Bryks, 906 F.Supp. at
210); Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran,
999 F.Supp. 1, 11 n. 3 (D.D.C.1998) (noting
favorable practice of applying FSIA to individuals).
Thus, this Court finds that immunity
may be available to Prince Sultan,
as the third-highest ranking member of
the Saudi government, and to Prince
Turki, as the Director of Saudi Arabia’s
Department of General Intelligence, to the
extent their alleged actions were performed
in their official capacities.
[10] The Federal Plaintiffs argue that
the FSIA cannot apply to Prince Turki
because, as of September 10, 2003 when
the complaint was filed, Prince Turki was
the Saudi ambassador to the United Kingdom,
a position the Federal Plaintiffs allege
is not entitled to immunity under the
FSIA. In support of this argument, the
Federal Plaintiffs cite Dole Food Co. v.
Patrickson, 538 U.S. 468, 480, 123 S.Ct.
1655, 155 L.Ed.2d 643 (2003), in which the
Supreme Court held that instrumentality
status is determined at the time of the
filing of the complaint.
has specifically addressed the issue.

24. After the parties submitted their briefs and
argued the FSIA issue, the Ashton Plaintiffs
filed supplemental affidavits, without leave of
the Court, to contest, for the first time, the
timing of the PIF’s majority ownership. See
03 MD 1570 Docket # 455. The parties agree
that the PIF bought 50% of NCB shares in
May 1999. See John Fawcett Sept. 23, 2004
Supplemental Affidavit at Ex. 1 (‘‘Fawcett
Supp. Aff.’’). Later in 1999, the PIF sold 10%
of its shares to the General Organization for
[11] The Court disagrees with this reliance
on Dole Food. The Supreme Court
resolved two questions in Dole Food. ‘‘The
first [was] whether a corporate subsidiary
can claim instrumentality status where the
foreign state does not own a majority of its
shares but does own a majority of the
shares of a corporate parent one or more
tiers above the subsidiary. The second
question [was] whether a corporation’s instrumentality
status is defined as of the
time an alleged tort or other actionable
wrong occurred or, on the other hand, at
the time the suit is filed.’’ Id. at 471, 123
S.Ct. 1655. The Supreme Court held that
a foreign state’s ownership of an entity
must be direct for the entity to be considered
an instrumentality. Id. at 474, 123
S.Ct. 1655. The Supreme Court also ruled
that ownership must be determined as of
the date on which the complaint was filed.
Id. at 480, 123 S.Ct. 1655. Neither of
these points of law speaks, however, to the
circumstances under which an individual is
covered by the FSIA. Indeed, numerous
other courts that have addressed this issue
have held that the relevant inquiry for
individuals is simply whether the acts in
question were undertaken at a time when
the individual was acting in an official capacity.
See, e.g., Velasco, 370 F.3d at 398–
99; Byrd, 182 F.3d at 388; Bryks, 906
F.Supp. at 210. This Court considers that
precedent to be more consistent with the
FSIA and unaltered by the decision in
Dole Food. Thus, it deems Prince Turki
the equivalent of the foreign state inasmuch
as the complaints allege actions taken
in his official capacity as the head of the
DGI. Accordingly, both Prince Sultan and
Prince Turki are immune from suit for
their official acts unless an exception under
the FSIA applies.
2. National Commercial Bank
NCB submits that it is an instrumentality
of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and
therefore immune from suit. See Decl. of
Nizar Bin Obaid Madani, Assistant Minister
of Foreign Affairs of Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia ¶ 2, at Berger Decl. Ex. 7 (‘‘It is
the position of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs that NCB is a government instrumentality
of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.’’).
To enjoy immunity from suit under
the FSIA, NCB must demonstrate that it
is an agency or instrumentality, or a political
subdivision of the Kingdom. 28 U.S.C.
§ 1603(a). As explained above, the FSIA
defines an ‘‘agency or instrumentality’’ as
(1) ‘‘a separate legal person, TTT(2) which
is an organ of a foreign state or political
subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose
shares or other ownership interest is
owned by a foreign state or political subdivision
thereof,’’ and (3) a non-U.S. citizen.
28 U.S.C. § 1603(b). Accordingly, NCB
claims that (1) it is a separate legal person,
(2) at the time the suit was filed a majority
of its shares were owned by an administrative
unit of the Saudi Ministry of Finance,
the Public Investment Fund (‘‘PIF’’), 24 and
(3) it is not a citizen of the United States
Social Insurance. Fawcett Supp. Aff. at Ex.
2. Late in 2002 the PIF agreed to buy 30% of
the remaining shares from the bin Mahfouz
family, but Plaintiffs claim the purchase was
not completed until January 2003, after the
lawsuit was filed on September 4, 2002. See
Fawcett Supp. Aff. at Ex. 3 & 4 (news accounts
of sale). For the reasons that will be
explained below, the Court finds it unnecessary
to resolve this dispute at this time.
790 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES
or created under the laws of a third country.
[12] In Dole Food, the Supreme Court
held ‘‘that only direct ownership of a majority
of shares by the foreign state satisfies
the statutory requirement’’ outlined in
§ 1603(b). 538 U.S. at 474, 123 S.Ct. 1655.
Accordingly, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s
ownership of NCB must be direct for
NCB to enjoy immunity under the FSIA.
That is, NCB will not be deemed an instrumentality
of the Kingdom if the PIF, its
majority owner, is determined to be an
agency, instrumentality, or organ of the
Kingdom. See § 1603(b)(2) (stating agency
or instrumentality is entity whose majority
ownership interest is held by either
the foreign state or a political subdivision
thereof); Filler v. Hanvit Bank, 378 F.3d
213 (2d Cir.2004) (holding an organ’s ownership
of two banks did not, in turn, make
the banks organs or instrumentalities of
foreign state); see also In re Ski Train
Fire in Kaprun, Austria, 198 F.Supp.2d
420, 426 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (holding ski resort
owner, which was owned in part by instrumentality
of Austrian government, was not
instrumentality because it was not owned
directly by the state or a subdivision thereof);
Hyatt Corp. v. Stanton, 945 F.Supp.
675, 688 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (concluding ‘‘that
corporations a majority of whose shares
are owned by agencies or instrumentalities
of foreign states are not themselves agencies
or instrumentalities’’). Thus, NCB
must demonstrate that the PIF is the
equivalent of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
or a political subdivision thereof.
The PIF was established by Royal Decree
with the sole function of ‘‘financing
TTT investments in productive projects of
a commercial nature whether they belong
to the Government or the industrial lending
institutions connected to it or to its
public corporations and whether these
projects are undertaken independently or
in partnership between these administrative
parties and private institutions.’’ PIF

do not. Id. ¶ 5; Supplemental Al–Wohaibi

Aff.’’).
a. Status of the PIF
In Filler v. Hanvit Bank, a case with
facts very similar to those presented here,
the Second Circuit reiterated Dole Food ’s
requirement of direct ownership for instrumentality
status. Two defendants were
commercial banks majority-owned by the
Korean Deposit Insurance Corporation
(‘‘KDIC’’), a ‘‘governmental institution’’
run by the Korean Ministry of Finance
and the Economy of the Republic of Korea.
Filler, 378 F.3d at 215–16. In determining
if KDIC was an organ of Korea,
the court considered several factors:
IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001
Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)
791
(1) whether the foreign state created
the entity for a national purpose; (2)
whether the foreign state actively supervises
the entity; (3) whether the foreign
state requires the hiring of public employees
and pays their salaries; (4)
whether the entity holds exclusive rights
to some right in the [foreign] country;
and (5) how the entity is treated under
foreign state law.
Id. at 217 (citing Kelly v. Syria Shell
Petroleum Dev. B.V., 213 F.3d 841, 846–47
(5th Cir.2000) (alteration in original)).
The Second Circuit held that the KDIC
was an organ of Korea because it was
formed by statute and presidential decree;
it performs the governmental functions of
protecting depositors and promoting financial
stability; its directors are appointed
by the Ministry of Finance and Economy;
its president is appointed by the President
of the Republic of Korea; and many of its
operations are overseen by the Ministry of
Finance and Economy. Id.
The banks argued that once the court
determined KDIC was an organ of the
foreign state, the banks automatically became
instrumentalities or agencies of the
state because KDIC owned a majority of
their stock. Id. The Second Circuit rejected
this argument, finding such a holding
would ‘‘permit an infinite number of subsidiaries
to enjoy sovereign immunity, TTT
would be incompatible with the purpose of
the FSIA, which is to grant governmental,
not private corporate immunity, and TTT
would reflect infidelity to the Supreme
Court’s reasoning in Dole Food.’’ Id. at
218. Accordingly, it reiterated that ‘‘ ‘a
subsidiary of an instrumentality is not itself
entitled to instrumentality status’ TTT
and that ‘only direct ownership of a majority
of shares by the foreign state satisfies
the statutory requirement.’ ’’ Id. (quoting
Dole Food, 538 U.S. at 473–74, 123 S.Ct.
1655).
The Second Circuit determined the
KDIC was an organ of Korea by considering
whether it was created and supervised
by a foreign state and whether public employees
were performing public functions.
Id. at 217. Under its reasoning, it would
appear the PIF is also an organ. It was
created by royal decree, it is supervised by
the Kingdom’s Council of Ministers and
staffed with government employees. See
PIF Charter.
Yet, under the ‘‘legal characteristics’’
test, the PIF could qualify as a political
subdivision. See Hyatt, 945 F.Supp. at
680. In Hyatt, a court in this district
reasoned that a statutory requirement of
an agency or instrumentality, as opposed
to a political subdivision, is that it is a
‘‘separate legal person TTT that can function
independent of the state.’’ Id. at 684.
If an entity could sue and be sued, own
property, and contract in its own name, it
would be considered an agency or instrumentality
and not a political subdivision.
Id. at 685. NCB submits the PIF sues
and is sued as, and generally holds property
on behalf of, the Ministry of Finance.
Al–Wohaibi Aff. ¶¶ 9, 12.
NCB argues the Court should employ
the ‘‘core functions’’ test outlined in Transaero,
Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana,
30 F.3d 148 (D.C.Cir.1994), to find that the
PIF is the equivalent of the Kingdom.
Under this test, if the entity’s core functions
are governmental, it is considered
the state itself. Id. at 153. If its functions
are commercial in nature, it is considered
an instrumentality. Id. This Court is governed
by Second Circuit precedent and
finds Filler and Hyatt to be controlling.
Even if it were to adopt Transaero, however,
the Court finds on the record before it
that the PIF’s emphasis on commercial
projects precludes a finding that its core
functions are governmental in nature. See
PIF Charter ¶ 2 (noting the PIF’s primary
792 349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES
function of ‘‘financing TTT investments in
productive projects of a commercial nature’’).
NCB also urges that O’Connell Machinery
Co. v. M.V. ‘‘Americana,’’ 734 F.2d 115
(2d Cir.1984), mandates the finding that
the PIF is a political subdivision of the
Kingdom. In O’Connell, the Second Circuit
reasoned that the legislative history of
the FSIA indicated that ‘‘political subdivisions’’
were intended to include ‘‘all governmental
units beneath the central government.’’
Id. (quoting H.R.Rep. No.
1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 15, reprinted in,
1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6613). Given the
PIF’s position under the Ministry of Finance,
O’Connell could lead to the conclusion
that the PIF is a political subdivision
of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Id.; but
see In re Ski Train Fire, 198 F.Supp.2d at
425 n. 9 (distinguishing O’Connell on
grounds that the court based its holding on
a finding that the Italian government double-tiered
its administrative agencies);
Hyatt, 945 F.Supp. at 683–84 (finding definition
of ‘‘political subdivision’’ in O’Connell
too broad and suggesting the case
should be limited to its facts and not applied
widely). In the twenty years since
O’Connell was decided, however, courts
have been inclined to limit the FSIA’s
grant of immunity. See, e.g., Dole Food,
538 U.S. at 473–74, 123 S.Ct. 1655; Filler,
378 F.3d at 218. Accordingly, the Court
will not rely on O’Connell here.
b. Limited Jurisdictional Discovery
is Warranted
[13] The Court finds that resolution of
the PIF’s and thereby NCB’s status is not
determinable on the current record and,
therefore, limited jurisdictional discovery
is warranted. As explained above, the
PIF could qualify either as an organ or
political subdivision of the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia. Additionally, the affidavits on
which the parties ask the Court to rely
have not been subjected to cross examination
and are rather self-serving. The parties
should have the opportunity to take
discovery of the jurisdictionally relevant
facts. First City, 150 F.3d at 177; see also
In re Magnetic Audiotape Antitrust Litig.,
334 F.3d 204, 208 (2d Cir.2003) (instructing
district court to permit discovery before
granting motion to dismiss based on factsensitive,
multi-factor test). Accordingly,
NCB’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction based on the FSIA
is denied without prejudice. Limited jurisdictional
discovery will be permitted to
explore PIF’s function, organizational
structure, and place within the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia.
D. Application of FSIA Exceptions
to the Princes and Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia
Three exceptions to foreign sovereign
immunity are implicated in these motions—the
commercial activities exception,
28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2), the state sponsor of
terrorism exception, 28 U.S.C.
§ 1605(a)(7), and the torts exception, 28
U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5).
1. Commercial Activities Exception
[14] Section 1605(a)(2) states:
A foreign state shall not be immune TTT
in any case TTT in which the action is
based TTT upon an act performed in the
United States in connection with a commercial
activity of the foreign state elsewhere;
or upon an act outside the territory
of the United States in connection
with a commercial activity of the foreign
state elsewhere and that act causes a
direct effect in the United States.
28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2). The statute defines
‘‘commercial activity’’ as ‘‘either a
regular course of commercial conduct or a
particular commercial transaction or act.
IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001
Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)
793
The commercial character of an activity
shall be determined by reference to the
nature of the course of conduct or particular
transaction or act, rather than by reference
to its purpose.’’ 28 U.S.C. § 1603(d).
The Supreme Court has explained, ‘‘when
a foreign government acts, not as a regulator
of the market, but in the manner of a
private player within it, the foreign sovereign’s
actions are ‘commercial’ within the
meaning of the FSIA.’’ Weltover, 504 U.S.
at 614, 112 S.Ct. 2160. Courts must inquire
whether the foreign state’s actions
‘‘are the type of actions by which a private
party engages in trade and traffic or commerce.’’
Id. (internal citations omitted).
[15] Judge Robertson determined that
the commercial activity exception did not
apply to the Burnett Plaintiffs’ claims
against Prince Sultan and Prince Turki
because ‘‘the act of contributing to a foundation
is not within our ordinary understanding
of ‘trade and traffic or commerce’
nor, apparently was it within the contemplation
of TTT Congress.’’ Burnett II, 292
F.Supp.2d at 18 (citing H.R.Rep. No. 94–
1487, at 16, reprinted in 1976
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6615). Thus, the consolidated
Plaintiffs do not assert that the commercial
activities exception is applicable to
any of the Defendants raising FSIA defenses
here. This Court adopts Judge
Robertson’s reasoning. To the extent any
Plaintiffs’ claims are based on a Defendant’s
contributions to charities, those acts
cannot be considered commercial.
[16, 17] The Federal Plaintiffs allege
that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Prince
Sultan, and Prince Turki financed terrorism
by contributing to or supporting charities
