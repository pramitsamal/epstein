BY MR. SCAROLA:
Q. -- that's a young woman.
MR. SCOTT: Objection. You're cutting the
witness off. You're not letting him finish.
A. This looks like a picture out of a Playboy
or Penthouse magazine. It does not look to me like
a person who is under the age of 16 or 17 or 18.
But I don't think you can tell anything from the
picture. I think you can tell much more from
meeting somebody and being with them and having a
conversation with them.
MR. SCAROLA: Let's mark this photograph,
if we could, as Exhibit Number 4.
(Thereupon, marked as Plaintiff
Exhibit 4.)
BY MR. SCAROLA: .
Q. Does Exhibit Number 4 help you at all to
recognize this young woman?
A. I've never -- | have no -- no recollection

of this young woman at all.

Q. Allright. Would you describe for us,
please, the Tatiana that you flew with Jeffrey
Epstein on November 17, 2005?

A. First, | want to emphasize that that's
three years later than any of the issues involved in

this case. | have no recollection of flying with

this woman. | saw the name Tatiana on a manifest.
And my recoliection of Tatiana -- | have

no recollection of flying with her, but my

recollection of Tatiana is that she was a serious,

mid 20s woman friend of Jeffrey Epstein, who I may

have met on one or two or three occasions when he

was with her in -- perhaps at Harvard University

where he was meeting with academics and scholars, or

perhaps -- I think that's probably the context

where -- where she might have been.

Q. But you never flew with her?

A. Thave no recollection of flying with her.

Q. Okay. Well, let me sec if this helps to
refresh your recollection, Mr. Dershowitz.

MR. SCAROLA: Let's mark this as Exhibit

Number 5, please.

THE WITNESS: Uh-huh, yes.
(Thereupon, marked as Plaintiff
Exhibit 5.)
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. De you see that the name of the woman in
the photographs I have handed you is Tatiana
Kovylina, K-O-V-Y-L-I-N-A, a Victoria Secrets model?

The photographs, sir, look at the

photographs. The photographs identify the woman as
Tatiana Kovylina, correct?
A. Yes, but --
MR. SCOTT: Mr. Dershowitz, take your
time --
THE WITNESS: Yeah.
MR. SCOTT: -- review the exhibits. Don't
be rushed by Mr. Scarola.
A. Yes, it's a different -- different
spelling of the name. The Tatiana on the manifest
is spelled T-A-I-T-A-N-N-A.
The Tatiana in the photograph is
T-A-T-I-N -- LA-N-A. I have no idea whether --
BY MR. SCAROLA:
Q. The last name --
A. -- they are the same person.
Q. -- is the same, Kovylina, right?
A. There's no last name.
Q. Well, read down a little bit further, if
you would, Mr. Dershowitz.
A. You mean as toa different flight?
Q. Yes, sir. Identifying the return flight
for the same Tatiana.
A. [have no idea that it's a return flight.
I have nothing on the record that suggests that it's

200

areturn flight. And it has different people on it.
So I have no reason to believe it's a return flight.

Q. Is the last -- the question that I asked
you, Mr. Dershowitz, is: Is the last name spelled
exactly the same as the last name is spelled in the
two photographs I have shown you?

A. Let me look. So, on the 20th of
November --

Q. Is the last name --

MR. SCOTT: Whoa, whoa --
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. -- spelled the same way on both the flight
log and the two photographs I have shown you?
A. On-- you mean on a flight log that I was
not on the flight? Is that right? You're talking

about a flight log that I was not on the flight,
right?

Q. That flight log shows you on multiple
flights, does it not?

A. It shows me not on that flight. It shows
me on a number of flights, but not on that flight.

MR. SCOTT: What's the date of the
flights?

THE WITNESS: The date of that flight
is -- looks like November 20th, 2005, more
