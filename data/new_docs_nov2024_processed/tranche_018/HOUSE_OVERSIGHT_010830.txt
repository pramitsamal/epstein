MR. SIMPSON: I'm not going to argue with

MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.
MR. SIMPSON: -- I disagree with that

MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.
MR. SIMPSON: And we -- and I believe,
Ms. McCawley, were you instructing not to answer

THE WITNESS: Okay.

by the reporter.)

A. So Iwas beginning to draw an adverse
inference when Jeffrey Epstein, who is at the heart of
the sexual abuse of, not only Virginia Roberts, but
dozens and dozens and dozens of -- of girls literally
scattered across the globe, takes the Fifth, refuses to
answer the question, off the top of my head, I can't
recall exactly, but something along lines of: Do you
know Alan Dershowitz? And he says, I take the Fifth.
That sort of, frankly, startled me, that -- that this
international sex trafficker was taking the Fifth now
when asked about Mr. Dershowitz.

And so I was stymied in trying to get
information from Mr. Epstein at that point. I think
there were two depositions, if I recall correctly off
the top of my head, that -- that I had an opportunity to

review, in which he took the Fifth when asked questions
about Dershowitz.

So, at that point, in trying to figure out,
you know, whether Mr. Dershowitz was involved in
sexually abusing, not only Virginia Roberts, but in
other girls, then you go down to the next level, next
layer of the criminal conspiracy.

Epstein is at the top, so you go to the next
layer. These are, you know, basically the -- the women
who, from what I could gather, were -- were older than
the age that Epstein wanted to sexually abuse, I think
these were 22 and 23-year-old girls, so they had, you
know, essentially aged out of being his sexual abuse
victims, but they continued to -- what they would do is
collect girls for him under the age of 18, that I guess
was in his target range.

And so what -- so the next person I wanted to
talk to, you know, and get information from was Sarah
Kellen. Sarah Kellen is on a lot of these flight logs
with, you know, these girls that -- or women and with
Epstein and others, and so I wanted to talk to Sarah
Kellen.

But what I discovered there was that, when
Sarah Kellen was asked about Alan Dershowitz, she took
the Fifth, and there was -- she wasn't the only one.

There was Miss Mucinska, who also took the Fifth when
asked questions about Alan Dershowitz.

And then there was Marcin -- Miss Marcinkova
who also took the Fifth. So what we -- what I had at
this point was Jeffrey Epstein's international sex
trafficking organization. I had the next echelon, and
both the top kingpin of the sex trafficking
organization, and the next echelon had taken the Fifth,
had refused to answer questions about Alan Dershowitz.

And so, at -- at that point, I was drawing an
adverse inference, not just from one person, but from
four persons, and that adverse inference was being
strengthened by the surrounding circumstances, some of
which we have already talked about.

One of the things that -- that really
bolstered the adverse inference that I was drawing in
this case was that I've mentioned those three girls,
Kellen, Mucinska, and Marcinkova, They were all covered
by a nonprosecution agreement. And the nonprosecution
agreement was highly unusual.

I -- I had been a federal prosecutor for

about four years, I had been a federal judge for about

five-and-a-half years, so I had seen a lot of -- of, you

know, nonprosecution types of arrangements. And one of

the things that was very unusual in this one is, it has
