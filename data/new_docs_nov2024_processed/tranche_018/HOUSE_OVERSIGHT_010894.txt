Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 291-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/21/2015 Page 4 of 20

10. Epstein took me on a ferry boat on one of the trips to New York City and there he
took the picture above. I was approximately 15 or 16 years old at the time.

11. Over the next few weeks, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell trained me to do
what they wanted, including sexual activities and the use of sexual toys. The training was in
New York and Florida, at Epstein’s mansions. It was basically every day and was like going to
school. [also had to have sex with Epstein many times.

12. —_[ was trained to be “everything a man wanted me to be.” It wasn’t just sexual
training - they wanted me to be able to cater to all the needs of the men they were going to send
me to. They said that they loved that I was very compliant and knew how to keep my mouth
shut.

13. Epstein and Maxwell also told me that they wanted me to produce things for them
in addition to performing sex on the men. They told to me to pay attention to the details about
what the men wanted, so I could report back to them.

14. From very early on I was fearful of Epstein. Epstein told me he was a billionaire.

>

I told my mother that I was working for this rich guy, and she said “go, go far away.” Epstein
had promised me a lot, and I knew if I left I would be in big trouble. I also knew that I was a
witness to a lot of illegal and very bad behavior by Epstein and his friends. If I left Epstein, he
knew all kinds of powerful people. He could have had me killed or abducted, and I always knew
he was capable of that if I did not obey him. He let me know that he knew many people in high

places. Speaking about himself, he said “I can get away” with things. I was very scared,

particularly since I was a teenager.
