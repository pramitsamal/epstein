dPV(x)= F (ze *° dz j (2.2)

where q is the appropriate time discount rate.

Note the implication

F (z)dz= dPV(x)et?™), (2.3)

showing that q is the growth rate that raises the value of dPV(x) to F (z)dz over

period z—x. Since this differential component of asset value defers all positive cash
flow until moment z, and cannot in itself be affected by later transfers in, q
simplifies by (A1.6a) to rate of return. This was Boehm Bawerk’s insight, although
he was not mathematical, in equating time preference rate to rate of return r. Thus

(2.2) and (2.3) give

dPV(x)dx=F, (zje’ dz and F (z)dz= dPV(xJe™’™, (A2.4)

where r is the appropriate rate of return and time discount rate equivalently.

But what determines appropriate r in these equations? Rate of return varies with
risk among different assets at the same time, and varies over time with economic
circumstances. Most sources I have seen treat r in (A2.4) as a variable to be

integrated over (x, z). | myself long believed the same.

My view now looks to the context. The asset as a whole will typically have received
many differential investments before time x, and may receive many after. Each at
inception will have been priced by the owner’s time preference rate then. But my

theme in risk theory is that assets can be traded or modified to the current owner's
