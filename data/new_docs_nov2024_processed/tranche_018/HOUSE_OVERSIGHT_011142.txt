national accounts to tease them apart, and to judge whatever pay should be imputed

to people in the household sector not literally employed.

The Level Payment Mortgage
(A2.5) gives

V(x)=F [F@eror dz . (A7.1)

Consider the level payment mortgage. F(z) is the constant level payment while r(x)

is the constant interest rate Here (A2.5) simplifies to

V(x)= Ff-et™ dz=Fe™ im edz= “[1 —e@ ex) | (A7.2)

As there is no self-invested output, and no negative cash flow after initial investment

at time 0, decapitilization (amortization) simplifies to -V(x). Thus

confirming that amortization increases exponentially over the term of the mortgage.

Depreciation Theory

Depreciation can be defined as decapitalization which is a function of time since
capitalization alone. When assets change hands, depreciation continues unchanged.
Depletion and liquidation in sale, by contrast, are options available at any asset age.

Amortization can be given the same definition as depreciation, but is customarily
