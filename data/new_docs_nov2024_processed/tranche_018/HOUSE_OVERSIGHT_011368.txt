treatment, got medications, all of which are reflected in her
medical records and are something that about which she may be

records would no longer be the same as a private individual.

Your Honor, Motion in limine 17, again, the dollar

value of the Jane Doe settlement depends entirely on what

happens in terms of plaintiff's case in chief and whether any

other evidence regarding the Jane Doe 102 litigation comes into

vidence, because if it does, then the settlement and the

settlement amount may very well become relevant, but I can't

say right now how anyone intends to use that at trial, why it

would be relevant, and I can't say whether or not the

settlement amount would likewise be relevant.

Motion in limine 18, the Cassell-Edwards—Dershowitz

litigation and their settlement. It's interesting to note

this case.
