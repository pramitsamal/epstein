And so their failure to respond --

THE COURT: What was the point, that that was not

another defamation?

MS. MENNINGER: Exactly. In the case of Adelson v.

Harris, just like in this case, there was one allegedly

defamatory statement afterwards. There was a press release
issued that stated, we stand by everything we said. Those
facts are very similar to ours, where there was a written
statement issued and then our client, did she or did she not
republish that, is that a separate defamatory event.

G

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you very much. Now, at least

a6}

in this little small part of this dispute, I know where I am.

Okay. Thanks.

MS. MENNINGER: And the Adelson case, your Honor,

controls and says that referring back to a statement, such as a
previous press release, is not actionable, and summary judgment

has been granted on such alleged republications. So now, in

this motion in limine, is not the time to be dealing with the

substantive point that plaintiff basically conceded during
summary judgment.

Thank you.

MS. SCHULTZ: Hi, your Honor. Meredith Schultz,
counsel for Ms. Giuffre.

This motion in limine has already been decided by this

Court's summary judgment order, thereby rendering it moot in
