Active Stewardship

Nine years ago, in mid-March, Bear Stearns, which in 2007 traded
at over $125 per share, was sold to J.P. Morgan for $10 per share
in a transaction that many mark as the beginning of, what we now
know as, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. While it is said that

the passage of time heals all wounds, the disastrous contagion
across the global financial landscape, the collapse of numerous
large financial institutions and the loss of public trust in the
financial services sector remains on the minds of many. Whether it
was opaque counterparty exposure, excessive leverage, insufficient
risk management, or a lack of corporate transparency, we now
know that these factors in combination led to the near collapse
of the entire global financial system. While the financial markets
have moved well beyond that terrible day in March of 2008, the
public trust of a very large sector of the global economy is still
severely marred due to continued bad behavior, lack of corporate
transparency, accountability and proper risk management, as well
as risky business practices.
