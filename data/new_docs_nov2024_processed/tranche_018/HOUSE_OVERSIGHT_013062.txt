146 8 Cognitive Synergy

where the Context involves sensory, episodic and/or declarative knowledge; and attentional
knowledge is used to regulate how much resource is given to each such schematic implication in
memory. Synergy among the learning processes dealing with the context, the procedure and the
goal is critical to the adequate execution of the cognitive schematic using feasible computational
resources.

Finally, drilling a little deeper into Point 3 above, one arrives at a number of possible knowl-
edge creation mechanisms (cognitive processes) corresponding to each of the key types of knowl-
edge. Figure ?? below gives a high-level overview of the main types of cognitive process con-
sidered in the current version of Cognitive Synergy Theory, categorized according to the type
of knowledge with which each process deals.

8.3 Cognitive Synergy in CogPrime

Different cognitive systems will use different processes to fulfill the various roles identified in
Figure ?? above. Here we briefly preview the basic cognitive processes that the CogPrime AGI
design uses for these roles, and the synergies that exist between these.

Tables 8.1 and 8.3 present the key structures and processes involved in CogPrime, identifying
each one with a certain memory/process type as considered in cognitive synergy theory. That
is: each of these cognitive structures or processes deals with one or more types of memory —
declarative, procedural, sensory, episodic or attentional. Table 8.5 describes the key CogPrime
