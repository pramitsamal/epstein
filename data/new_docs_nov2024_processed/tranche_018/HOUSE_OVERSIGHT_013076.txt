160 8 Cognitive Synergy

Hopefully it’s clear that the motivation behind the line of thinking presented here is a desire
to understand the nature of general intelligence and its pursuit — not a desire to avoid testing our
AGI software! Really, as AGI engineers, we would love to have a sensible rigorous way to test our
intermediary progress toward AGI, so as to be able to pose convincing arguments to skeptics,
funding sources, potential collaborators and so forth. Our motivation here is not a desire to
avoid having the intermediate progress of our efforts measured, but rather a desire to explain
the frustrating (but by now rather well-established) difficulty of creating such intermediate
goals for human-level AGI in a meaningful way.

If we or someone else figures out a compelling way to measure partial progress toward AGI,
we will celebrate the occasion. But it seems worth seriously considering the possibility that the
difficulty in finding such a measure reflects fundamental properties of general intelligence.

From a practical CogPrime perspective, we are interested in a variety of evaluation and
testing methods, including the virtual preschool approach mentioned briefly above and more
extensively in later chapters. However, our focus will be on evaluation methods that give us
meaningful information about CogPrime’s progress, given our knowledge of how CogPrime
works and our understanding of the underlying theory. We are unlikely to focus on the achieve-
ment of intermediate test results capable of convincing skeptics of the reality of our partial
progress, because we have not yet seen any credible tests of this nature, and because we suspect
the reasons for this lack may be rooted in deep properties of feasible general intelligence, such
as tricky cognitive synergy.
