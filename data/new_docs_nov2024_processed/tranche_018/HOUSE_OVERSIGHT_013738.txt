multiply periodic and aperiodic oscillations of thalamic and cortical cells and their
recursive, feedback coupling, the brain stem manifests more than two orders of
magnitude of “independent” neuronal driving frequencies ranging from serotonin
discharges at 1 Hz, cortically direct dopamine and norepinephrine neurons in the
10-50Hz range and mesencephalic reticular neurons discharging as fast as 100 to
200 Hz. The “thalamocortical brain wave oscillator” as their target has been a fixture
in global state neurophysiology since the 1940’s and 1950’s and is of great current
interest (Fessard et al, 1961; Bazhenov et al, 1998). We have explored the
relationships between strange nonchaotic dynamics and brain-stem neuronal and
thalamocortical physiology from the standpoint of neuronal coding and the
properties of the EEG attractor. (Mandell et al, 1991; Mandell and Kelso, 1991;
Mandell and Selz, 1992; 1993;1994:1997a). We found that the EEG attractor could
be characterized by the diagnostic triad identifying strange nonchaotic attractors:
A=0, Do and D, # Integer, and a signatory power spectral distribution in which the
number of peaks, N, with amplitudes greater than ow, N(w ), went as wo, 1<a <2
(Romeiras et al, 1987; Mandell et al, 1991). In addition to being consistent with
known multifrequency, brain stem driving of thalamocortical oscillations, the EEG as
a strange, nonchaotic attractor is intuitively appealing in that it has the necessary
mechanisms for the power law scaling of a wide range of characteristic times (Do
and D, =~ Integer) from picosecond fluctuations of neural membrane proteins to the
decades of bipolar phenomena and since 2=0, the orbital points don’t tend to

“mix’(get out of order) on the attractor, thus protecting the fidelity of sequence

dependent brain information transport (Berns and Sejnowski, 1998).

We avoid the temptation to deal with the deep analogy between
thermodynamic entropy (Clausius, 1897) and information theoretic entropy
(Shannon and Weaver, 1949), constraining our discussion to the context of an

operational equivalence (in healthy systems) between gain of information and
