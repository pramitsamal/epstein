that cost just $20,000 per year. Here are the brokers who can make it happen:

» LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION

After I read the section on outsourcing, I thought it sounded like a novel idea but would never work for
me. However, since the rest of the book was “spot on,” I decided to try it. Rather than ship my money
overseas, I opted to keep it in the U.S. and use my niece in college, with skills on computers I can’t even
fathom, to test the theory. Turns out it has been a great experience and timesaver for me, as well as
moneymaker for her. It seems I have all of the positives of out sourcing but none of the hassles of
language and such.... Being able to mold a young mind for the better ties in well with the rest of your
book ...
