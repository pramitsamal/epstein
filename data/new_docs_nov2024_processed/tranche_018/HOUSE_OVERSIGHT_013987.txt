But where to go and what to do? There is no one right answer to either. Use the following questions
and resources to brainstorm:

What makes you most angry about the state of the world?

What are you most afraid of for the next generation, whether you have children or not?

What makes you happiest in your life? How can you help others have the same?
There is no need to limit yourself to one location. Remember Robin, who traveled through South
America for a year with her husband and seven-year-old son? The three of them spent one to two
months doing volunteer work in each location, including building wheelchairs in Banos, Ecuador,

rehabilitating exotic animals in the Bolivian rain forest, and shepherding leather-back sea turtles in
Suriname.

How about doing archaeological excavation in Jordan or tsunami relief on the islands of Thailand?

4. Revisit and reset dreamlines.
Following the mini-retirement, revisit the dreamlines set in Definition and reset them as needed. The
following questions will help:

What are you good at?

What could you be the best at?

What makes you happy?

What excites you?

What makes you feel accomplished and good about yourself?

What are you most proud of having accomplished in your life’? Can you repeat this or further develop
it?
