without interfering in the investigation. Generally, this point in time is
defined by the opening of a criminal investigation.”**

Given the way the two statutes work, it would make no sense to
artificially confine the CVRA’s reach until after the filing of a criminal
complaint. Before then, victims will have often received information from
the Department about the status of the investigation. They might wish to
confer with prosecutors about how the case is proceeding, and the CVRA
extends to them a right to confer.” Similarly, while the Department is
notifying victims about the services they may receive and the status of an
investigation, it is important that the victims be treated fairly. The CVRA
extends the right to be treated fairly.!°° Indeed, it would be absurd to think
that Congress wanted to permit the Justice Department to treat crime
victims unfairly until criminal charges have been filed.

Instead of recognizing Congress’s intent, OLC’s 2011 memorandum
simply cites to a series of cases in which courts concluded that a victim of
uncharged conduct should not be afforded statutory protections.'°! Yet
none of these cases—United States v. Turner,'°? Searcy v. Paletz,'® or
Searcy v. Skinner'°*—provide strong support for OLC’s position. Turner is
a particularly poor fit. Although OLC’s memorandum characterizes Turner
as excluding victims of uncharged conduct,’ the magistrate judge adopted
an inclusive reading of the statute precisely because of his reservations
about the CVRA’s legislative history and plain language. The judge
suggested that “any person who self-identifies as [a victim]” could be
presumed to qualify for protection under the CVRA as a preliminary
matter.!°° In fact, the line quoted by the Department is lifted out of context.
The full sentence reads: “While the offense charged against a defendant can
