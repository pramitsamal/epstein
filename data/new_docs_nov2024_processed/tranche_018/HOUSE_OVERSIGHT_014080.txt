2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 101
crimes or crimes against children.”4! In Indiana, the plain language of its
statute leaves open the possibility of a conferral nght before formal charges
to the extent that the statute includes two separate time frames: “after a
crime ... has been charged” or “before any disposition of a criminal case
involving the victim.”?

To be sure, not all states have afforded victims a voice throughout the
entirety of the criminal justice process.** In some states, the statutes are
ambiguous. In a handful of states, there is clear language limiting rights
until after the filing of charges. For example, Louisiana constrains the
conferral right to criminal matters “in which formal charges have been filed
by the district attorney’s office.” Yet, unlike the federal CVRA, this
statute specifically excludes pre-charging situations. And, in any event,
despite Louisiana’s limitation on a particular night within the statute, the
legislature in this state still often saw fit to provide the victim with
notification rights, even in the absence of the formal filing of charges.**°

Very few state courts have ever considered the precise issue of
whether conferral rights may attach prior to the formal filing of charges.
This is likely caused by the fact that, unlike the federal statute, many state
statutes fail to provide the victim with a procedural mechanism for
challenging the conduct of prosecutors or law enforcement agencies.**’
However, in rare cases, state courts have implicitly recognized that a
meaningful interpretation of victims’ rights should include some rights prior
to filing.

For example, a Connecticut court concluded that a company injured by
the delinquent act of a minor was entitled to information about the case

*41 Tpano CODE ANN. § 19-5306(1)\(f) (2004). As in the case of most of the state
statutes, the Idaho statute is not without ambiguity. A different provision within the statute
makes the notification right contingent “[u]pon the filing of a criminal complaint or juvenile
petition... .” Id. § 19-5306(2).

*42 In, CODE ANN, § 35-40-5-3(b) (West 2012), id. § 35-40-1-1 (failing to define “case”).

*43 See, e.g., MD. Const. art. 47(b) (“In a case originating by indictment or information
filed in a circuit court, a victim of crime shall have the right to be informed . . . .”).

*44 Tn Delaware, for example, the statute contains an additional limitation in the conferral
provision that is noticeably absent from the duty imposed on law enforcement to provide
information about the victim’s rights to that victim. Compare DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 11,
§ 9405 (2007), and DEL. CoDE ANN. tit. 11, § 9411 (2007) (imposing additional
requirements after the Attorney General commences the prosecution), with DEL. CODE ANN.
tit. 11, § 9410 (2007). Query whether the limitations imposed in one section should be
inferred in the other under the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius.

remedies in victims’ rights statutes).
