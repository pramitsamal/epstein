Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Production of Documents

Two days later, Dershowitz told Lou Dobbs on Fox Business, that he had already
completed his investigation and had “all kinds of records” proving that Jane Doe No. 3 was a
liar:

They [Edwards and Cassell] did it for crass financial and political reasons. More

to prove through all kinds of records that I couldn’t have been in these places.

The woman is a serial liar. If they had done that investigation, they would have
come to the same conclusion.

false allegations, they would have found absolute proof that I did not [sexually abuse her] .. .
even the most minimal of investigation would have proven conclusively that I could not have
had sex with their client on Mr Epstein’s island, in New Mexico or on the airplanes; and that I
did not have sex with her in his New York or Palm Beach homes.” DE 282-1 at { 8.

On January 6, 2015, plaintiffs Edwards and Cassell filed their complaint in this action,
alleging a massive public assault on their character by defendant Dershowitz. On January 9,
2015, Edwards and Cassell filed their Initial Request for Production to Defendant Alan M.
