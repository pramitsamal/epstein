Certainty that Brexit negotiations will start, but uncertainty on the details

Against this debt and growth backdrop, investors are likely to want clarity and visibility
on policymaking in order to continue funding the UKk’s deficit in our view. We think they
could be disappointed.

Firstly, the Government has committed to triggering Article 50 by the end of March
2017. We think this is likely irrespective of the outcome of the Judicial Review on where
the legislative power lies for making that decision. Second, the Government’s formal
position is not to announce its negotiating strategy in public. A lack of insight into the
Uk’s future trading relationship with its biggest export market for goods and services is
a difficult backdrop upon which to continue investing in the UK, even if a few companies
have taken that decision already. Third, we think there will have to be a resolution to the
trade-off between the Government’s desire to control immigration and reach a
beneficial economic settlement. The problem, as is often repeated by EU leaders, is that
curbing migration puts the UK on a collision course with the EU’s four freedoms and
therefore at odds with access to the single market. That’s why our base case remains a
so called “hard Brexit”, but even now our colleagues in FX strategy think investors are
not positioned for this. Hence their GBP/USD forecast of 1.15 for Q1/Q2 2017.

Finally, a major concern for investors and especially business investment would be if the
UK faces a “cliff edge” for trade terms in 2019 (on the assumption article 50 is
triggered). While a transition deal would be a potential positive development next year,
the absence of such a deal before or soon after article 50 is triggered could be another
reason for policy uncertainty to spike higher again.
