increasingly concerned about the structural fault
lines of emerging market countries. These fault
lines were discussed in detail in our December
2013 Insight, Emerging Markets: As the
Tide Goes Out.

We continue to recommend a zero allocation
to emerging market debt (dollar-denominated
and local currency debt) and a 2% allocation
to emerging market equities in a moderate-risk
diversified portfolio. We highlight emerging market
assets because, yet again, our base case returns,
especially for emerging market equities, appear
compelling, but we are not recommending a
tactical allocation to this asset class. As we discuss
below in our review of the risks to our economic
and financial market outlook, China is our biggest
source of concern in 2017 and for the next few
years. Emerging markets are the countries that
would be most negatively impacted by any shocks
emanating from China.

Our 2017 expected returns, shown in Exhibit
22, are the lowest returns we have published since
the global financial crisis. Not a single broad asset
class is expected to have double-digit returns. Cash
has an expected return of 1%. Expected returns
for intermediate investment grade fixed income
securities range between 0% and 1% depending
on maturities, an expectation driven by our view of
rising rates as the Federal Reserve hikes the federal
funds rate two or three times in 2017. US equities,
which are the most expensive of global equities,
have an expected return of about 3%, and we
expect slightly higher returns in other developed
market equities. Hedge funds, an asset class for
which we have had modest single-digit return
expectations since our 2013 Outlook (as shown in
Exhibit 21), should continue to have modest returns;
we expect a 3% return before taxes, compared to a
5% annualized return expectation in 2013 and an
annualized return of 3% over the last four years.

In aggregate, a moderate-risk diversified
portfolio for taxable clients is expected to
have a return of about 3%. We must note
that our return expectations are not meant
to promote a specific investment, and

that their basis on current capital market
assumptions implies they will likely
change over the course of the year.

At this point, our clients may well be
asking why they should remain invested
in a diversified portfolio with such paltry
