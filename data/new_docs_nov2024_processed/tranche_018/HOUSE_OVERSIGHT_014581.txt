SECTION III

2017 Financial Markets
Outlook: The Horns of
a Dilemma

INVESTORS HAVE HAD AN AMAZING BULL RUN. Including last
year’s 12% total return, the S&P 500 is nearly 3.5 times as high
as its financial crisis trough. The advance has been equally long-
lasting, second in length only to the almost-decade-long period
that preceded the technology bubble in 2000. These impressive
gains are not limited to just equities or US assets. US corporate
high yield has gained 177% over the same time span, while the
total return of the MSCI All Country World Index excluding
the United States has been higher only 5% of the time over
comparable eight-year periods since 1994.

But as we begin a new year, these gains have left investors
on the horns of a dilemma. Put simply, they must now choose
to either remain invested at high valuations and bear the
associated risk of loss or exit the market and forgo the potential
for upside surprises as well as returns that are attractive
compared to the alternatives.
