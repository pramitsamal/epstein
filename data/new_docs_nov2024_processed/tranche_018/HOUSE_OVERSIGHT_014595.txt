partly reflected in current exchange rates, the US
dollar is vulnerable to both domestic and foreign
disappointments.

In sum, we expect the dollar to appreciate
further, but at a slower pace and with greater
volatility than in recent years.

Euro

The euro was on the losing side of the US

dollar’s strength again in 2016, marking the third
consecutive year of underperformance and the
longest stretch of annual declines since 2001. Last
year’s modest 3.2% decline actually masked a
much larger 10% drop from the euro’s intra-year
peak, half of which came in the weeks following
the US elections in November. Needless to say, the
combination of potentially expansionary fiscal
policy put in place by the new administration
coupled with tighter US monetary policy represents
a stiff headwind to the euro, particularly since

We should not lose sight of the fact
that after such persistent weakness
versus the US dollar, the euro is
undervalued and investors are now
positioned for further weakness.

the ECB just extended quantitative easing until
December 2017.

We expect these transatlantic policy divergences

to persist, driving European investors to continue
seeking higher-yielding, non-euro-denominated
assets abroad (see Exhibit 73). This preference

will likely be bolstered by uncertainty surrounding
upcoming national elections in Germany, France,
the Netherlands and possibly Italy and Spain.
While our central case assumes mainstream parties
prevail, any result that raises questions about the
long-term viability of the European Monetary

Union could push the euro even lower.

Still, we should not lose sight of the fact that
after such persistent weakness versus the US dollar,
the euro is undervalued and investors are now
positioned for further weakness. Additionally, the
above-trend Eurozone growth and normalizing
inflation we expect could justify the ECB shifting
toward a more neutral stance later this year.

Such a move would narrow the interest
rate differential between the US and
Eurozone, weakening a linchpin of the
weaker euro thesis.

Given this balance of risks, we
removed our tactical short positions in
the euro relative to the dollar following
the November US presidential election,
returning to a neutral view.
