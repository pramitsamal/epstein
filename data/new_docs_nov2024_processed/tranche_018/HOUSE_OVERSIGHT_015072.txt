over and over and over again while | was working. That afternoon, | told
God | couldn’ t believe in him any more because--even though he was
supposed to be a loving and all-powerful being--he had allowed such
devastation to happen. And then | heard the voice of God:

“ALLOWED? WHY DO YOU THINK | GAVE HUMANS FREE WILL?”

“Okay, well, I' m exercising my free will to believe that you don’ t
exist.”

“ALL RIGHT, PAL, IT’ S YOUR LOSS!”

At least we would remain on speaking terms. But | knew it was a
game. | enjoyed the paradox of developing a dialogue with a being whose
reality now ranked with that of Santa Claus. Our previous relationship had
instilled in me a touchstone of objectivity that could still serve to help keep
me honest. | realized, though, that whenever | prayed, | was only talking to
myself.

The only thing | can remember from my entire college education is a
definition of philosophy as “the rationalization of life.” For my term
paper, | decided to write a dialogue between Plato and an atheist. On a
whim, | looked up Atheism in the Manhattan phone book, and there it was:

“Atheism, American Association for the Advancement of.” | went to their

office for background material.
