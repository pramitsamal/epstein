has imposed restrictions on restaurants, requiring patio patrons to order
food with their drinks, and forbidding customers to dance. Proprietors now
play less upbeat music so that nobody will be tempted to dance. Those
who can’ t resist are asked to stop.

Incidentally, | find out that, instead of giving the Freedom Award to
me, convention officials have decided to present ABC with an Anti-
Freedom Award, but that notion gets lost somewhere in award limbo,
along with my original unspoken opening line.

On Friday night, the massage clinic that doesn’ t take place is
followed by the Wild West Casino and Dance. One man comes attired in a
sheriff’ s outfit with a rubber penis drooping almost to the floor. A
security guard tells him that he’ Il have to check it. Fake knives, guns and
bullets are acceptable, but not a fake sex organ. Another cowboy, with a
real (unloaded) gun, is stopped by a security guard, but he resists,
asserting in his best John Wayne manner, “This is an 1887 pistol, and
I' m not about to check it.”

Several folks leave the dance at midnight to attend an unofficial 3rd
annual spanking party. It ends at 3 a.m. with a bout of fist fucking. Dear

Abby was right. One thing does lead to another.
