12/8/2015 Prince Andrew and girl, 17, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him | Daily Mail Online

Organiser: Ghislaine Maxwell looks on as Andrew put his arm around Virginia. Robert Maxwell's daughter
invited her to work as Epstein's personal masseuse soon after her 15th birthday

We kissed on the cheek and Ghislaine placed me on his other knee.’ Johanna spoke to The Mail on
Sunday three years ago about this incident, which took place when she was 21.

She said: ‘Ghislaine put the puppet’s hand on Virginia’s breast, then Andrew put his hand on my
breast. It was a great joke. Everybody laughed.’ After this, Virginia was paid, by Epstein, around
$400 (£250).’

She met Andrew for the third and final time on Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little Saint James.
Virginia was never under the British legal age of consent when she met Andrew. She was 17 during
the first two encounters and 18 at the third.

By now, however, Epstein, had started to hint
that she was getting ‘too old’ for him.

But during one trip to the island, Epstein and
Ghislaine made their most astonishing
proposition, and one which repulsed her. ‘They
said Jeffrey wanted me to have his child,’ she
says.

‘They said | was part of their family and | was
beautiful,young, loyal and nurturing and would
be a great mother.

They said | would have to sign a contract
relinquishing rights to the child and consenting
to Jeffrey having as many relationships as he
liked. In return | would have my own mansion in
Palm Beach and a large monthly payment, a
percentage of his income.’

This, finally, was a wake-up call to Virginia and
she began to see the way in which she had
been groomed.

‘It was a smack in the face,’ she says. ‘I finally
realised this wasn’t ever going to be a real
relationship but | knew if | refused, I’d be thrown
back on the streets. So | said, “I’m too young. |
want to get my massage credentials, then

oe

maybe we'll do it”.

The tycoon took her at her word and, for her
19th birthday in August 2002, flew her to
Thailand where he enrolled her in a massage
course.

Shortly after arriving there, she met an
Australian martial arts expert called Robert.
They fell in love and, just ten days later, married

in a Buddhist ceremony. Conviction: Jeffrey Epstein

‘lL called Jeffrey and told him I’d fallen madly in

love,’ Virginia says. ‘| was hoping he’d be

delighted. But he said, “Have a nice life,” and hung up on me.’ The couple now have two sons, aged
five and four, and a daughter who recently turned one.
