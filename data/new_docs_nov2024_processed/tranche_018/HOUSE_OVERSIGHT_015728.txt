practice. A number of people
have wondered whether you
can take this literally, and if you
devote 10,000 hours to practicing
something you can become
world class. Dan McLaughlin
from the USA used to be a
professional photographer and
decided he might like to become
a professional golfer. He quit his
job and is now 3,500 hours in. So

Gladwell’s interpretation of
Ericsson's results is not without
controversy. Ericsson stresses
‘purposeful practice’ is the
important element. Practicing
the wrong thing for ten thousand
hours will just make you good at doing something wrong. Practicing
without concentration and attention will equally have little effect. One

period. After he retired he was asked if he could recite it from memory.
Despite reading it as many as 5000 times during his working life, he was

thing you want to do if you wish to learn it, in this case recall.

Computers don’t require practice to learn a skill. If their program
is right they work correctly, and if it is wrong, they are always wrong.
Computers can be programmed to learn but so far this learning has been
limited to specific problem domains, such as face recognition. They do
not have the general-purpose capability humans enjoy.
