around the globe to meet each other. Each day the world’s population
takes three million plane flights. Around 80% of these are business
flights. Some are people emigrating or going to do specific manual tasks,

be that the parties are not able to convey sufficient information to fully
understand each other. Face-to-face meeting may convey much more
information than we think.
