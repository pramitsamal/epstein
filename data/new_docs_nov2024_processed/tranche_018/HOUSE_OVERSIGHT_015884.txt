194 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

write down the rules and then play the ‘game of mathematics’ to derive
every possible truth. Hilbert despised the idea that there could be
unknowable things and was a forthright speaker. His battle cry was: Wir
miissen wissen — wir werden wissen! “We must know — we will know!”
He believed there were no fundamental unknowns in the world.

Donald Rumsfeld famously summed up the problem of unknowns
in an attempt to clarify a question from a journalist at a Whitehouse

press conference:

“There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We
also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know
there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown
unknowns — the ones we don’t know we don’t know.”

Interestingly Donald Rumsfeld, like Bertrand Russell, is another
person to span a huge swath of time in the public eye. He was both
the youngest and the oldest serving U.S. Secretary of Defense, serving
under both Richard Nixon and George W. Bush. We will shortly discover
Rumsfeld’s convoluted view of the world turns out to be closer to the
truth than Hilbert’s tidy mathematical aspiration.

As well as believing there were no unknowable unknowns Hilbert
thought mathematics was completely abstract. You did not need to know
what you were talking about. Whether the symbols meant dogs, cats or
numbers all you needed to do was apply the rules and all would be well.
His belief is captured in his quote below.

“Tt must be
possible to
replace in all
geometric
statements the
words point,
line, plane by
table, chair,
beer mug”
David Hilbert
