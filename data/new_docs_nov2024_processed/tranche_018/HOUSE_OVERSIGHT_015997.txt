construct the next generation, they ran their businesses into the ground
while ignoring the technology discontinuity. Despite their legions of Ivy
League graduates and business school MBAs, they all went bankrupt.

As he looked around the economy, he found a similar pattern in
other sectors. Minicomputer companies failed to make the jump to
personal computers. Further back in time, buggy whip companies —
in the Fortune 100 at the turn of the 20 century — failed to make the
transition to the motor vehicle economy. The only exception he could
find was IBM. IBM had successfully navigated some transitions but

mainframes to Linux based servers and their survival was in question.
Why was this so?

and Compaq -— not in the existing powerhouses of computing — Digital
