Kochen-Specker Cube

cannot. It must make up its mind on the fly. Einstein would be horrified.
Realism is violated by the quantum world: reality and measurement are
intertwined.

The Kochen-Specker paradox shows us that a particle only makes
its choice at the point of measurement. This does not prove it has free
will as it might still be told what to do by some external entity. It’s rather
like the famous game show, Who Wants to be a Millionaire? The particle
could answer the spin question in four possible ways. First, it could know
the answer, but we have just proven it does not. Second, it could phone a
friend obtaining the answer from some cosmic arbiter. Third, it could ask
the audience and take a vote from all the particles around it. Finally, it
could freely choose, without recourse to any of the other possible options
— in other words, it would guess!
