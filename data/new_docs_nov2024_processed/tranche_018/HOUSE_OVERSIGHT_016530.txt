federal enforcement practice, but this is less common.) !*4 State prosecutors’ decisions, at least for certain categories of serious
wrongdoing, face de facto review by federal executive officials.

Or so the law for a century has permitted. The constitutional double jeopardy doctrine since at least 1922 has recognized the
dual sovereignty of state and federal governments. Notwithstanding the guarantee that no person shall be subject for the
same offence to be twice put in jeopardy, the Double Jeopardy Clause has been understood not to preclude federal prosecutors'
power to charge a person who has previously been prosecuted by state officials for the same criminal conduct, and federal
prosecutions likewise do not limit subsequent state enforcement efforts. !5° By granting certiorari in United States v. Gamble

this term, the U.S. Supreme Court is set to revisit this doctrine, which provides the foundation for the federalism-based

check on underenforcement.

Federal prosecutors do not attempt to keep an eye on all state prosecution decisions and practices, and federal criminal [*887]
law is not fully coextensive with state criminal law; significant gaps are discussed in the next Part. But the substantive
redundancy is considerable. For some areas of dual authority - such as drug crimes, fraud, child pornography, and human
trafficking - federal and state agencies often coordinate investigative efforts and divide up prosecution responsibilities. But
federal Justice Department policy to exercise oversight of state enforcement practices in certain categories of crime is
deliberate and formalized. Notable examples include state and local government corruption, excessive use of force and other
wrongdoing by police, and other criminal civil rights violations. 1!37 Especially in these areas, federal prosecutors assess
whether to file their own charges in cases in which their state counterparts declined to charge, charged too leniently, or in
which they failed to win appropriate convictions. Federal prosecution in the wake of state declination is hardly the norm - it

should not be, if state prosecutors decline cases for the right reasons !38

- but federal officials do remedy meaningful
enforcement gaps left by state prosecutors.

Functionally, this inter-governmental model of review resembles intra-agency administrative review with greater independence
between initial decision makers and subsequent reviewers. Oversight of state prosecutors rests with the policy [*888]
priorities of federal executive branch officials. The Justice Department has well-established written guidelines for much of this
oversight activity, although they are not formally binding. '4° Although the Justice Department bureaucracy has a stronger
