A. Case # 06-2049, 1742 S. Ocean Blvd., Gunther E. Lehman
Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-87 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, all exterior walls, gates and fences shall be kept in a good state of
repair.

Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton presented the facts of this case and said
they are essentially the same as case # 06-2050. The Board had previously heard
the cases which concerned a wall which split the property line between the two
properties. Both properties were found in non-compliance and there was
dissention about whose wall it was and who was responsible for the repairs. Each
property owner has repaired the portion of the wall which belongs to them and the
Town is requesting the cases be dismissed.

MOTION BY MR. KOEPPEL TO DISMISS THE CASE
