Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08

MOTION BY MS. GREENBERG TO POSTPONE THE FINE
REDUCTION HEARING UNTIL AUGUST 21, 2008

SECONDED BY MS. VAN BUREN

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

IX. Comments:

Ms. Greenberg said that the presentation using the “slides” made it too dark in the room.
She wanted to know if there was anything they could do as a Board in making a
suggestion to the Council about an ordinance that could address people not pulling
permits because of the safety issues in terms of multi-family dwellings. Capt. Blouin said
there was a provision in place. If work is done without a permit, there is a penalty
involved. There was an ordinance drafted last year that requires them to pay four times
the permit fee.

Mr. Fried asked Mr. Randolph if he had spoken to Mr. Elwell about the foreclosure action
being brought to the Board’s area of responsibility as opposed to the Town Council. Mr.
Randolph said he had but did not have an answer yet and would try to get one. Mr. Fried
asked Ms. Houston about progress on the fines and she said the Town was now inputting
fines into the computer system and if someone had outstanding fines they could not get
any permits. People are contacting Code Enforcement because they cannot get permits
and are either paying or asking to come back to the Board for a fine reduction.

Capt. Blouin advised that with regard to any foreclosure action, the police department is
scrutinizing each and every one of them as some of these cases we have liens on were pre-
existing prior to coming to the police department. We do not want to bring a case to the
board that can be handled in a different manner.

Mr. Walton remarked that it was a good thing that there are a number of working without
permit cases being brought to the Board, that it means Staff is doing their job.

X. Adjournment:

The meeting was adjourned without benefit of a motion.
