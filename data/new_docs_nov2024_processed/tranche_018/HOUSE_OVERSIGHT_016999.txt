“In the Future, Everyone Will Be World Famous for 7.5
Minutes” —Whatshisname

People, too, rise to prominence, only to be forgotten (22).
Fame can be tracked by measuring the frequency of a
person’s name (Fig. 3C). We compared the rise to fame of the
most famous people of different eras. We took all 740,000
people with entries in Wikipedia, removed cases where
several famous individuals share a name, and sorted the rest
by birthdate and frequency (23). For every year from 1800-
1950, we constructed a cohort consisting of the fifty most
famous people born in that year. For example, the 1882
cohort includes “Virginia Woolf” and “Felix Frankfurter”; the
1946 cohort includes “Bill Clinton” and “Steven Spielberg.”
We plotted the median frequency for the names in each
cohort over time (Fig. 3D-E). The resulting trajectories were
all similar. Each cohort had a pre-celebrity period ( median
frequency <10°), followed by a rapid rise to prominence, a
peak, and a slow decline. We therefore characterized each
cohort using four parameters: (1) the age of initial celebrity;
(ii) the doubling time of the mitial rise; (111) the age of peak
celebrity; (iv) the half-life of the decline (Fig. 3E). The age of
peak celebrity has been consistent over time: about 75 years
after birth. But the other parameters have been changing.
Fame comes sooner and rises faster: between the early 19th
century and the mid-20th century, the age of initial celebrity
declined from 43 to 29 years, and the doubling time fell from
8.1 to 3.3 years. As a result, the most famous people alive
today are more famous — in books — than their predecessors.
Yet this fame is increasingly short-lived: the post-peak half-
life dropped from 120 to 71 years during the nineteenth
century.

We repeated this analysis with all 42,358 people in the
databases of Encyclopaedia Britannica (24), which reflect a
process of expert curation that began in 1768. The results
were similar (7). Thus, people are getting more famous than
ever before, but are being forgotten more rapidly than ever.

Occupational choices affect the rise to fame. We focused
on the 25 most famous individuals born between 1800 and
1920 in seven occupations (actors, artists, writers, politicians,
biologists, physicists, and mathematicians), examining how
their fame grew as a function of age (Fig. 3F).

Actors tend to become famous earliest, at around 30. But
the fame of the actors we studied — whose ascent preceded the
spread of television — rises slowly thereafter. (Their fame
peaked at a frequency of 2x10°7.) The writers became famous
about a decade after the actors, but rose for longer and to a
much higher peak (8x10°’). Politicians did not become
famous until their 50s, when, upon being elected President of
the United States (in 11 of 25 cases; 9 more were heads of
other states) they rapidly rose to become the most famous of
the groups (1x10°).

Science is a poor route to fame. Physicists and biologists
eventually reached a similar level of fame as actors (1x10),
but it took them far longer. Alas, even at their peak,
mathematicians tend not to be appreciated by the public
(2x10%).

Detecting Censorship and Suppression

Suppression — of a person, or an idea — leaves quantifiable
fingerprints (25). For instance, Nazi censorship of the Jewish
artist Mare Chagall is evident by comparing the frequency of
“Mare Chagall” in English and in German books (Fig.4A). In
both languages, there is a rapid ascent starting in the late
1910s (when Chagall was in his early 30s). In English, the
ascent continues. But in German, the artist’s popularity
decreases, reaching a nadir from 1936-1944, when his full
name appears only once. (In contrast, from 1946-1954, “Mare
Chagall” appears nearly 100 times in the German corpus.)
Such examples are found in many countries, including Russia
(e.g. Trotsky), China (Tiananmen Square) and the US (the
Hollywood Ten, blacklisted in 1947) (Fig.4B-D).

We probed the impact of censorship on a person’s cultural
influence in Nazi Germany. Led by such figures as the
librarian Wolfgang Hermann, the Nazis created lists of
authors and artists whose “undesirable”, “degenerate” work
was banned from libraries and museums and publicly burned
(26-28). We plotted median usage in German for five such
lists: artists (100 names), as well as writers of Literature
(147), Politics (117), History (53), and Philosophy (35) (Fig
4E). We also included a collection of Nazi party members
[547 names, ref (7)]. The five suppressed groups exhibited a
decline. This decline was modest for writers of history (9%)
and literature (27%), but pronounced in politics (60%),
philosophy (76%), and art (56%). The only group whose
signal increased during the Third Reich was the Nazi party
members [a 500% increase; ref (7)].

Gtven such strong signals, we tested whether one could
identify victims of Nazi repression de novo. We computed a
“suppression index” s for each person by dividing their
frequency from 1933 — 1945 by the mean frequency in 1925-
1933 and in 1955-1965 (Fig.4F, Inset). In English, the
distribution of suppression indices is tightly centered around
unity. Fewer than 1% of individuals lie at the extremes (s<1/5
or s>5).

In German, the distribution in much wider, and skewed
leftward: suppression in Nazi Germany was not the
exception, but the rule (Fig. 4F). At the far left, 9.8% of
individuals showed strong suppression (s<1/5). This
population is highly enriched for documented victims of
repression, such as Pablo Picasso (s=0.12), the Bauhaus
architect Walter Gropius (s=0.16), and Hermann Maas
(s<.01), an influential Protestant Minister who helped many
Jews flee (7). (Maas was later recognized by Israel’s Yad
Vashem as a “Righteous Among the Nations.”) At the other
