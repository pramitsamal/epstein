8. Celebrities will almost always disappoint you. Most are boring, banal and self-centered.
High profile cases are a decidedly mixed bag. If you never have a celebrity case during
your career, you haven’t missed anything.

9. Clients whether civil or criminal, are increasingly brought to trial not only before a judge
in robes and a jury of peers, but also in the “court of public opinion,” where every citizen
gets to “cast a vote” on the legal and moral aspects of the case. For some clients in the
public eye—political figures, entertainers, business moguls, even ordinary citizens—the
“verdict” rendered by the court of public opinion may be as important as the verdict of the
jury or court. But being aware of the importance of winning in the media is not enough.
A good lawyer must be prepared to face the media, where the usual rules of evidence do
not prevail. A good “all purpose” lawyer must learn the very different “rules” of the court
of public opinion and must develop the skills with which to win in that important forum as
well.

10. Despite the often distorting effect of the media on the administration of justice, the press
serves as an important check and balance on judges, prosecutors, and defense lawyers.
The First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of the press, may sometimes be in
conflict with other amendments designed to guarantee a fair trial. An appropriate balance,
difficult as it is to achieve, is essential to democratic governance.
