court determined this remedy does not address the Government's justifiable concerns regarding the risk of witness tampering
in circumstances where there is no evidence that the life or safety of a prospective witness is in danger. 734 In other words,
Jencks Act protection is not limited to situations where the government shows an actual danger to witnesses - its witness-
protective qualities reach much further. +75

[*917] The lack of grounds for subpoenas seeking victim information is more evident when viewed against a legal landscape
that gives defendants no right before trial to obtain even the names of government witnesses. Current law provides no basis for
the pretrial disclosure of the names and addresses of government witnesses - including witnesses who are crime victims. For
one thing, Rule 16, which governs discovery and inspection m criminal cases, contains no provisions for such disclosure. This
omission was purposeful and mirrors the witness-protective purposes of the Jencks Act:

A majority of the Conferees [that is, congressional members determining the language of Rule 16] believe it is not in the
interest of the effective administration of criminal justice to require that the government or the defendant be forced to reveal the
names and addresses of its witnesses before trial. Discouragement of witnesses and improper contacts directed at influencing
their testimony, were deemed paramount concerns in the formulation of this policy. 34°

Rule 16, therefore, along with other criminal discovery rules, does not entitle defendants to pretrial discovery of names and
addresses of prospective government witnesses or persons who have knowledge of the case. 337

By statute, capital cases are exempt from this rule. In capital cases, the accused is entitled to a copy of the indictment and a list
of juror and witness names and address - but only three days in advance of the trial. 33° And notably, the same statute
explicitly provides for the withholding of this information if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that providing
the list may jeopardize the life or safety of any person. 73° No statute authorizes similar disclosures in noncapital cases. As
the Eighth Circuit noted in United States v. Hutchings, neither [Rule 16(a)] governing information subject to disclosure by the
Government in criminal cases, nor any other federal rule or statute requires the Government to supply names of potential
