make no claim that these individuals were
acting on behalf of or at the behest of the
Kingdom. See, eg. id. 1420 (claiming
that in January 1999 Princess Haifa made
payments to Al-Bayoumi, a Defendant al-
leged to have paid rent on behalf of two of
the hijackers). Finally, Plaintiffs allege

4. National Commercial Bank

NCB was established in 1950 by Salim
bin Mahfouz, the father of Defendant
Khalid bin Mahfouz, as the first commer-
cial bank of Saudi Arabia. Ashton Com-
plaint 1563; Burnett Complaint 188. The
Ashton Plaintiffs allege that the bin Mah-
fouz family controlled NCB until 1999
when the Saudi government bought a ma-
jority of its shares. Ashton Complaint
1573.21 The Ashton and Burnett Plaintiffs
claim that NCB has a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary in New York, SNCB Securities,
Ltd., through which it operates an interna-
tional banking business. Ashton Com-
plaint 1563; Burnett Complaint 1 88.

Plaintiffs claim Osama bin Laden and al
Qaeda used NCB as “a financial arm, oper-
ating as a financial conduit for [their] oper-
ations.” Ashton Complaint 1564; Burnett
Complaint 189. In 1986, Khalid bin Mah-
fouz became NCB’s President and CEO
and remained so until 1999. Ashton Com-
plaint 1563; Burnett Complaint 188.
Also in 1986, Khalid bin Mahfouz became

plaint 11.89, 91. He was subsequently in-
dicted in New York state in connection
with his involvement in BCCI’s fraudulent
practices, which also implicated NCB. Ash-
ton Complaint 11564, 566; Burnett Com-
plaint 1189, 91.

Plaintiffs claim both NCB and BCCI
supported international terrorism. Ashton
Complaint 19 564-68; Burnett Complaint
1791-93. Specifically, a “1999 United
States Senate Report on the BCCI scheme
detailed the role of [NCB] in hiding assets,
money laundering, the cover-up and ob-
struction of a Senate investigation, and
sponsoring international terrorism.” Bur-
nett Complaint 189. Additionally, a 1998
NCB bank audit revealed irregularities in-
volving direct donations to several chari-
ties and that $74 million had been funneled
by the bank’s Zakat Committee to IIRO.”
Ashton Complaint 9569-71; Burnett
19 94, 95. NCB also allegedly made loans
to charitable organizations without the
knowledge of the Zakat Committee. Jd.
Plaintiffs allege “direct donations were re-
ceived through NCB facilities to the Red
Crescent Committee, [IIRO], and the Mu-
waffaq Foundation,” all Defendants in
these actions. Ashton Complaint 4570;
Burnett Complaint 195. Muwaffaq alleg-
edly provided Osama bin Laden with $3
million in 1998. Ashton Complaint 1573.
Plaintiffs claim NCB knew or should have
known it was materially supporting al Qae-
da, Osama bin Laden, and international
terrorism. Ashton Complaint 1570; Bur-
nett Complaint 1 95.
