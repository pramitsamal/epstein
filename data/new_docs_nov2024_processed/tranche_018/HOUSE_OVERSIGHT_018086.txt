Where the Arab spring will end is
anyone's guess

Ian Black

June 17, 2011 -- Tunisia's Jasmine revolution will always be
remembered as the event that triggered the Arab spring, which has
shattered the status quo from Libya to Syria and is widely seen as the
biggest transformative event of the 21st century so far. But, six
months on, progress has been patchy.

Mohammed Bouazizi, the young Tunisian who started it all by
burning himself to death in December 2010, had his desperate
imitators in Egypt, where revolution erupted days after Zine el-
Abidine Ben Ali's flight into Saudi exile; and in Jordan, which has
seen sporadic unrest but no uprising.

But if the politics of the Arab spring are local, many factors are
common across: young people angry and frustrated at the lack of
freedoms, opportunities and jobs, unaccountable and corrupt
governments, cronyism and, in a few places, grinding poverty.

Rich and poor alike lived in fear of the secret police. But Tunisia, one
of the most repressive regimes, fell quickly. The decision by the army
to dump the president and not crush the protests was a vital lesson for
the Egyptian generals. The alternative is the cruelty of the dictators'
fightbacks in Tripoli and Damascus. Regional differences were
ignored in the chain reaction that followed. Yemen's protests were
galvanised by the drama in Cairo's Tahrir Square but they also
involved tribalism, elite rivalry and a small but alarming al-Qaida
presence against a background of resource depletion and fear of state
