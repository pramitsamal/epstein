Do you know what the Most Innovative Location Device is?

No it’s not a compass or an astrolabe. It’s not semaphore or a smoke signal. Not an RFID tag or a
neon sign or phosphorous flare either.

Give up?

It’s the GPS Smart Shoe™ recently mentioned in Forbes Magazine, developed by GTX Corp
(OTCBB: GTXO.OB) and licensed to Aetrex Worldwide. Yes, a shoe...well a very smart shoe as
it can tell a caregiver the precise location, bearing, history, speed and altitude of an Alzheimer’s
victim that has eloped or wandered. No small feat — pun intended — to reduce the overwhelming
stress on the millions of victim caregivers while potentially saving thousands from injuries and
death owing to exposure, accidents and criminal activity. The GPS Shoe also reduces the
manpower drain on municipal services; fire, police and welfare agencies often enlisted to locate
the mentally ill.

While a Finalist in the Most Innovative Location Device category of the Locations & Beyond
Summit and the People’s Choice Awards is a wonderful acknowledgment for the years GTXO
invested in developing the solution and the promise that Aetrex has made in bringing the Shoe to
market... the real winners are those touched by this devastating disease for which there is no cure,

but now have a new measure of hope.
