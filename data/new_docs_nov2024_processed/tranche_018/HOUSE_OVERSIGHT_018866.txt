ST. CROIX — Luis Hospital Chief
Executive Jeff Nelson updated board
members about the hospital’s status
with federal regulators during a meet-
ing Thursday night.

Luis remains under the regulatory
microscope with the federal Centers

U.S. Attomey’s Office.

Bernice Kraftcheck and her
daughter, Danielle Haese, were
hoisted into the air for the parasail
fide as wind conditions were
deteriorating.

“The strong winds and a weak
tow-line caused the tow-line to
break, resulting in the parasail sep-
arating from the vessel and the two
women falling into the water,” the
statement reads. “The wind then
propelled the parasail, with the
women still attached, at a very
high rate of speed causing the
death of Kraftcheck and serious

from the federal agency is potentially
at stake.

CMS certification indicates a hos-

federal agency for services the hospi-

injuries to Haese.” '

The U.S. Coast Guard “aggres-
sively investigated” the accident,
which led to Coleman’s arrest and
the surrender of his merchant mari-
ner’s license in June, according to a
prepared statement by Capt. Drew
Pearson, the Coast Guard’s San Juan
commander. .

“The Coast Guard takes safety at
sea very seriously, and will ensure
that any mariner who causes anoth-
er’s death through misconduct, neg-
ligence, and inattention to his duties
is held accountable in a court of
law,” Pearson said in the release.

A medical examiner pronounced
Kraftcheck, 60, of Round Lake, IIl.,
dead at the West Indian Co. dock the
afternoon of the accident. Haese, 34
at the time, of Plymouth Meeting,
Pa., was hospitalized overnight at
Schneider Hospital.

The women were passengers
aboard the Celebrity Eclipse and
bought a parasailing shore-excur-
sion operated by Caribbean
Watersports and Tours.

The one-count grand jury indict-
ment charging Coleman was not
available on the District Court’s
online court records database as of

hospital is still falling short

Medicaid patients.

Revenues from CMS patients rep-
resent about 60 percent of the hospi-
tal’s income, Nelson said Thursday.

The hospital currently is operating
under two settlement agreements
with CMS, aimed at fixing problems
found by inspectors from the federal
agency during inspections in recent
yeas.

One of the agreements involves
the entire hospital.

Nelson on Thursday said that the
hospital recently had received a state-
ment of deficiencies from CMS after
inspectors conducted a follow-up,
focused survey in September as part
of the monitoring on that agreement.

Inspectors had found some
improvements, “but not enough,”
Nelson said Thursday.

The hospital has submitted a plan
of correction for the deficiencies, but
the federal agency said that the plan
was not creative or detailed enough,
Nelson told the board.

Hospital officials will work on the
plan of correction, and once CMS

approves it, the elements of the plan
will be part of the overall settlement
agreement, Nelson said after the
meeting.

Luis has until Feb. 13 to meet the
federal agency’s mandates for
improvement or it potentially will
lose CMS certification — although
Nelson said the surveys could come
sooner.

“We may see CMS here as early as
mid-December,” Nelson said.

The hospital also is in the process
of temporarily shutting down its psy-
chiatric unit for 90 days in an effort
to make improvements in that unit,
officials said. Luis.is working with a
hospital in the United States to come
to an agreement to temporarily trans-
fer its patients there, officials said.

The plan to temporarily close the
unit prompted considerable discus-
sion at the meeting. Some advocates
for the mentally ill, as well as some
physicians, raised questions about the
wisdom of the move.

Board members said it was neces-
sary to make improvements to the

Thursday night.

Coleman, 32, made his first
appearance before U.S. Magistrate
Judge Ruth Miller and was released
on a $10,000 unsecured bond,
according to the release. He is
scheduled to be arraigned in District
Court on Nov. 14, one day shy of
the one-year anniversary of
Kraftcheck’s death.

‘If convicted, Coleman could face
up to :0 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.

of standards

un so that the hospital can keep the
unit open in the long-term.

The other settlement agreement
Luis Hospital has with CMS is for
the dialysis unit.

The hospital has met the federal
standards for that unit, but the settle-
ment agreement remains in place
because CMS wanted to ensure that
the positive changes were sustained,
Nelson said.

That settlement agreement has
been extended once, and Nelson told
board members Thursday that he
anticipates it will be extended again
for futher monitoring, although he.
did not know for how long.

In other action, the board discussed
and approved reports and a variety of
recommendations from its Finance
Committee. It also approved a policy
related to public access to board
meeting minutes. Board chairwoman
Kye Walker said the document puts
the board’s current practices into a
policy.
