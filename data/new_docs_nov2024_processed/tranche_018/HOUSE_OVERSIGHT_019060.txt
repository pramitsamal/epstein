In addition to the home in Palm Beach, Epstein also
maintains a residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands, New York and
New Mexico.

To date, the PBCRA continues. to develop witnesses and
victims from across the United States. Due to the media coverage,
unknown status of the state investigation, vulnerability of the
young female victims, and political influences, the AUSAs and
Case Agents have a target date of January 2007 for indictment.

Based on the ongoing criminal investigation, the PBCRA
is requesting the assistance in establishing Epstein's criminal
activity utilizing interstate commerce and the travel in
interstate commerce to engage in illicit sexual conduct and
prostitution. Prior to conducting captioned leads, it is

requested that the lead agent(s) contact SA
FBI Miami, West Palm RA, or SA
or investigative direction and

questions.
