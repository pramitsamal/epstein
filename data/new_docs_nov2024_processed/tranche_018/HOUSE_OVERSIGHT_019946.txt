2007 and became a partner in 2010, running its philanthropic outreach, the Goldman
Sachs Foundation. Following a trend in the careers of many political operatives, she had
become, as well as an tiber networker, a corporate public affairs and PR-type adviser—
someone who knew the right people in power and had a keen sensitivity to how other
people’s power can be used.

The table of women lobbyists and communications professionals in the Four Seasons
that morning was certainly as interested in Powell, and her presence in the new
administration, as they were in the president’s daughter. If Ivanka Trump was a figure
more of novelty than of seriousness, the fact that she had helped bring Powell into the
White House and was now publicly conferring with her added a further dimension to the
president’s daughter. In a White House seeming to pursue a dead-set Trumpian way, this
was a hint of an alternative course. In the assessment of the other fixers and PR women at
the Four Seasons, this was a potential shadow White House—Trump’s own family not
assaulting the power structure but expressing an obvious enthusiasm for it.

Ivanka, after a long breakfast, made her way through the room. Between issuing
snappish instructions on her phone, she bestowed warm greetings and accepted business
cards.
