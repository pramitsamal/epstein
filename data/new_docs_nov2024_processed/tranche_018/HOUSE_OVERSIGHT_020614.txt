e Insist on reciprocity with Chinese actors in each domain of engagement.

e Identify what harms Canadian state, social, and community interests.

e Strengthen the practice of Canadian values of multiculturalism, open society, and
integration.

e Share experiences in each sector to build capacity and promote best practices,
particularly engaging the Canadian Chinese community.

e Train and make use of area specialists to better understand PRC intentions (just as
the PRC relies on “Western” specialists).
