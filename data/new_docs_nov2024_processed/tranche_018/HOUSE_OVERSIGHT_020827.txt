Third, the report highlights how powerful bipartisan constituencies have emerged in the past to
tackle great issues for the betterment of our nation, including tax reform, civil liberties,
healthcare, education and national defense. Just as presidents of both parties rose to the
occasion to preside over the difficult process of containment during the half-century cold war, we
know we can still find leaders who are willing to step up and overcome political or philosophical
differences for a good cause, even in these difficult times.

Finally, the report makes an important contribution to the question of timing. Momentum will
follow once the process begins to gain support, and USA Inc. should help by stimulating broad
recognition and understanding of the challenges, by providing ways to think about solutions, and
by helping constituencies of action to emerge. As the old saying goes, “If not now, when? If not
us, who?”

With this pioneering report, we have a refreshing, business-minded approach to understanding
and addressing our nation’s future. Read on...you may be surprised by how much you learn. We
hope you will be motivated to help solve the problem!
