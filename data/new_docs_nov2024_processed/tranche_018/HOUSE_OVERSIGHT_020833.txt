Millions of Americans have come to rely on Medicare and Medicaid — and spending has
skyrocketed, to 21% of USA Inc.’s total expenses (or $724B) in F2010, up from 5% forty
years ago.

Together, Medicaid and Medicare — the programs providing health insurance to low-income
households and the elderly, respectively — now account for 35% of total healthcare spending in
the USA. Since their creation in 1965, both programs have expanded markedly. Medicaid now
serves 16% of all Americans, compared with 2% at its inception; Medicare now serves 15% of
the population, up from 10% in 1966. As more Americans receive benefits and as healthcare
costs continue to outstrip GDP growth, total spending for the two entitlement programs is
accelerating. Over the last decade alone, Medicaid spending has doubled in real terms, with
total program costs running at $273 billion in F2010. Over the last 43 years, real Medicare
spending per beneficiary has risen 25 times, driving program costs well (10x) above original
projections. In fact, Medicare spending exceeded related revenues by $272 billion last year.

Amid the rancor about government’s role in healthcare spending, one fact is undeniable:
government spending on healthcare now consumes 8.2% of GDP, compared with just
1.3% fifty years ago.

The overall healthcare funding mix in the US is skewed toward private health insurance due to
the predominance of employer-sponsored funding (which covers 157MM working Americans and
their families, or 58% of the total population in 2008 vs. 64% in 1999). This mixed private-public
funding scheme has resulted in implicit cross-subsidies, whereby healthcare providers push
