How Would You Feel if...

...your Cash Flow was NEGATIVE for
each of the past 9 years...

... your Net Worth* has been
NEGATIVE for as long as you can
remember...

... t would take 20 years of your
income at the current level to pay off
your existing debt — assuming you
don't take on any more debt.

KP Note: *See slide 30 for net worth qualifier.
