...Entitlement Spending: Clarification On

‘Unfunded’ / ‘Net Responsibilities’

e Unless they are reduced, USA Inc.’s financial liabilities -- whether they are actual
debt or the present value of future promises, whether called ‘unfunded’ liabilities or
‘net responsibilities’ and whether funded by dedicated taxes or general revenue —
represent significant claims on USA Inc.’s future economic resources.

e To be sure, the projected unfunded liabilities are not the same as debt, because
Congress can change the laws that are behind those future promises. With a few
exceptions, however, over the past 60 years, lawmakers have acted to boost rather
than reduce them.
