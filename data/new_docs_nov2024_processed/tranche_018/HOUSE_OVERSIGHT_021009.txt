Review Wages: A Comprehensive / Independent
Review of Federal Wages & Benefits System May Be Worthwhile

Analysis of existing data on federal wages & benefits is controversial.

USA Today and the Cato Institute examined simple averages of federal (excluding military)
wages & benefits vs. private sector using Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data and
concluded that federal wages & benefits are ~100% higher than private industry — wages
are 58% higher while benefits are 3x higher.’ (March 2010, updated in August 2010)

The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) responded that gross average comparisons are ‘unfair and
untrue.’ And when one holds education and age constant, federal employees earn slightly
less than those in the private sector on average, although the difference is not statistically
significant.2 (March 2010)

The Heritage Foundation, in response to OPM and OMB’s comments, released a statistical
analysis based on BEA data, and claimed that adjusting for variables such as age,
education, marital status, race, gender, size of the metropolitan area, and several others,
federal wages & benefits are 31% higher than private industry for occupations in both
government and private sector.? (July 2010)
