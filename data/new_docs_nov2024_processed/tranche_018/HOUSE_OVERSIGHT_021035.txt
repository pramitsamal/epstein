Increase Employment: Structural Problems in USA Labor Force High

Healthcare Costs + Skills Mismatch + Labor Immobility

e Healthcare costs may be a barrier to hiring for employers

— Healthcare benefits = 8% of average total employee compensation; grew at 6.9%
CAGR from 1998 to 2008 compared with 4.5% CAGR in salaries.

— Healthcare benefits are fixed costs as they are paid on an annual per-worker basis
and do not vary with hours worked.

— As employers try to lower fixed costs to right-size to reduced revenue levels,
layoffs are the only way to reduce fixed healthcare costs.

e Skills mismatch may be a barrier to hiring for employers
— Alarge portion of the long-term unemployed may lack requisite skills.

— 14% of firms reported difficulty filling positions due to the lack of suitable talent, per
5/10 Manpower Research survey.

e Labor immobility resulting from the housing bust may be a barrier to hiring

— One in four homeowners are “trapped” because they owe more than their houses
are worth, so they cannot move to take new jobs — until they sell or walk away.
