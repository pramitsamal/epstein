Tax Policy Options From Report of the National Commission on

Fiscal Responsibility and Reform

e Consolidate the tax code into three individual income rates (15% / 25% / 35%) and one
corporate income rate (26%)

e Eliminate the complex tax codes such as AMT', PEP2, and Pease?
e Triple standard deduction to $30,000 ($15,000 for individuals)
e Repeal state & local tax deduction and miscellaneous itemized deductions

e Eliminate and modify several business tax expenditures (domestic production deduction /

depreciation rules)

e International tax reform including a territorial system®

Note: 1) AMT is the Alternative Minimum Tax; 2) PEP is Personal Exemption Phase-out designed to eliminate personal income exemptions for high earners; 3) Pease is a similar

phase-out, but instead of applying to personal exemption, it applies to most of the itemized deductions of a taxpayer's claims (mortgage interest, charitable gifts, state & local taxes

paid, etc.); Pease is named after Representative Donald Pease (D-OH) who pushed for its enactment in 1990. 4) LIFO is Last In, First Out’ which tend to reduce corporations’ income

taxes in times of inflation. 5) A territorial tax system is a tax system that taxes only income that is created within the borders of a specific territory (usually a country). Source: National

Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, “The Moment of Truth: Report of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform,” 12/1/10. Note that the Report also

identified two other scenarios called the ‘The Zero Plan’ which eliminates all tax expenditures and ‘Tax Reform Trigger’ which forces Congress to undertake comprehensive tax reform

K P by 2012 by raising taxes for each year Congress fails to act.
