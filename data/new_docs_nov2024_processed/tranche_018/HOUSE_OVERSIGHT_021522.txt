“Jeffrey Epstein did not
have sex with this woman,”
Sanchez said.

Herman suggested that
Epstein masturbated in front
of the alleged victim and
used a vibrator on her after
she was brought to his home
in February 2005. The girl is

: now 17.

“This was a typical 14-
year-old girl at the time she

‘ met Epstein,” Herman said. -

“What happened here was

despicable.”

The girl told police inves-
tigators that she informed
Epstein she was 18 when she
met him, and she said that
was her age on her Web page,
Sanchez said.

The girls father and step-

mother also attended the
; Mews conference.
“We're very angry,” the
_ father said. “It’s not right that
. this wealthy man can fly into
: town and destroy my daugh-
ter’s innocence.” He did not
take questions.

Epstein, 55, is a mysteri-

A Palm Beach County

followed an
exhaustive
investigation
by the Palm Beach Police De-
partment, which concluded

Herman’s client said her

meeting with Epstein was set
up by Haley Robson of Loxa-
hatchee, who was a Palm
Beach Community College
student at the time. When
Jane Doe arrived at Epstein’s
home, she was escorted by an
Epstein assistant, Sarah Kel-
len, to aroom with a massage
table, police reports and the
lawsuit say.

Epstein walked in wear

$300,

March 10, but

suit claims

ing only a towel, removed it
and lay naked on the mas-
sage table, the lawsuit says.
He demanded that Jane Doe
remove her clothing, and she
did, except for her under-
wear, the lawsuit alleges. The
sexual activity followed, the
suit says.

Epstein paid her $300 af
terward, and Robson got $200
for bringing the girl to him,
the lawsuit says.

Robson and Kellen helped
Epstein arrartige other liai-
sons with girls, Palm Beach
police concluded. Neither
was charged.

This. is not the first time ;
Epstein has been sued. over
purported activities with
teenage girls. He was sued
in New York in October by a
woman who says she had sex
with Epstein when she was
16 and had sought his help in
becoming a model.

The lawsuit filed Thurs-
day also alleges that Epstein
has assaulted girls on: his
private island in the Virgin
Islands. Herman declined to
elaborate on that assertion.
