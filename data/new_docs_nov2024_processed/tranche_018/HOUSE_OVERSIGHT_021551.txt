THREE young women suing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein for sex abuse
at his Palm Beach mansion want a federal judge to quash the plea
deal he made with the state of Florida to serve 18 months in jail in
exchange for admitting he solicited a 14-year-old hooker. Their
lawyer, Brad Edwards, has asked US District Judge Kenneth Marra
to toss the deal - which included an agreement that Epstein's wouldn't
face federal prosecution, which could have led to a longer jail term - Celeb Ph
because they weren't consulted on it. Marra has asked for more 2C1€ (
information before he rules. Epstein's rep, Howard Ruben stein,

said, The lawsuit has absolutely no merit. They're just looking for
money. These women have lied repeatedly, and in no way shape or

form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily.

And one of them showed Epstein a fake ID.
