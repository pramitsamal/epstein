Struggling Havensight merchants see rent-abatement
as last chance for them to resuscitate their businesses

ST. THOMAS —- For merchants
at Havensight mail, it’s summer
time, but the living is anything but
easy.

After being granted six months
of free rent by the mall’s owner, the
Government Employees Retirement
System, many said this has been
the worst off-season they -have
experienced.

They cited a perfect storm of
prolonged road construction in
front of the mall, fewer cruise ships
docking in St. Thomas Harbor,
competition from Crown Bay mer-
chants and skyrocketing utility
costs.

When the GERS board voted to
relieve.the tenants of rent obliga-

tions from July 1 to Dec. 31, they.

did so because tenants had accumu-
lated a delinquency of more than
$2 million and reported that they
could no longer sustain the cost of
doing business. The board dis-
cussed the closure of Dockside
Bookshop, which has announced
that it will close within the next
two weeks after 35 years in
business.

GERS. Administrator Austin
Nibbs presented the board with two
options: forego rent for six months
altogether with the stipulation that
tenants pay all arrearages by April
1 or give tenants a 25 percent
reduction in rent over the next 24
months. The board decided the six
month abatement, which would
cost GERS a little more than $3
million, would be the most feasible

way to give tenants a chance to pay’

the $2 million in back rent owed.

“T don’t like this rent abatement,
but if we want to continue to have
tenants, we are going to have to
help them,” Nibbs said.

At the meeting, some board
members were under the impres-
sion that another Havensight busi-
ness, ‘an office supply store called
The Draughting Shaft, was also
scheduled to close, but, according
to. The Draughting Shaft owner,
Terry Robinson, that was never the
case. .

Nevertheless, Robinson said, he
has had discussions with GERS
board members and attended meet-
ings to inform them of the adverse
conditions that had caused him to
fall behind in his rent.

Robinson said his business, unlike
many of the boutiques and stores that
cater primarily to tourists, had been
unduly hit by prolonged construc-
tion, with orange barricades diverting
traffic into and out of the mall’s park-
ing lots.

Dockside Bookshop in Havensight Mall is scheduled to close within the next,
two weeks after 35 years in business.

“Many of our customers are locals
and residents, and many have called
and said they just don’t want to come
in because they don’t want to deal
with, it,” Robinson said of the con-
struction.

six-month abatement would be the
“springboard” Havensight mer-
chants need to recover. If not, about
30 percent of the association’s. mem-
bership had reported that they would
go under this year or the next, he
said.

“The mall has been hurting since
Crown Bay opened. We lost about
500,000 passengers because of that,”
Mirpuri said. He added that the larg-
er Carnival cruise ships, the Oasis of
the Seas and the Allure of the Seas,
dock at Crown Bay, where the har-
bor can support them.

Projections are that, with more
cruise ships scheduled through
2014, businesses on the brink of clo-
sure might be able to use the abate-
ment to get through to a break-
through season in the winter of

2014, Mirpuni said.

Other merchants said their WAPA
bills had tripled or quadrupled since
they opened, leaving them to won-

+ der if an abatement would be enough -

to counter the rising rates.

“WAPA is killing us,” Sonny
Panjabi, owner of the Casa Blanca
jewelry store, said. Utility bills total
$3,000 during the busy season, and

hours of operation are cut back, he
said.

abatement. It will be a big help,” he
said.

Since the recession hit, travelers
“seem to spend all their money on
the trip itself, and they come with
less disposable income,” according
to Jerry Woodhouse, president of St.
John’s Bay Rum, a fragrance compa-
ny that supplies other Havensight
stores and has offices behind the
mall.

Woodhouse also said that in the
last decadehotels, which used to pro-
vide transportation to shopping dis-
tricts, have shifted to providing as
many amenities as possible to guests
and have limited the excursions to
beaches rather than shopping
districts.

“They want to grab as much reve-
nue as possible per customer while
they are staying at the hotel, 4
Woodhouse said. .
