THE WITNESS: It's, I mean, the question --

MR. SCAROLA: Yeah. But let's --

MR. SCOTT: I don't care.

MR. SCAROLA: Let's go ahead and finish.

MR. SCOTT: Let's go ahead and finish the
answer. We heard this much. I don't want to
break him on a roll.

MR. SCAROLA: Thanks.

THE WITNESS: Right. I mean, I want to
make -- I want to make clear that there was a lot
of information that I was relying on in filing
this pleading, and of course, the later pleading.
So we are on the subject of flight logs.

Flight logs showed that the flight logs that
Mr. Dershowitz had produced to Detective Riccari
were incomplete and inaccurate. And so that led
to concern on my part that Mr. Dershowitz had had
an opportunity to sanitize the flight logs, had
provided incomplete production, you know,
obviously, very important production that the
Palm Beach Police Department was looking at.

Then we got some additional flight logs from
Dave Rogers. What those flight logs showed --
first off, let's talk again about the production

of those flight logs.
