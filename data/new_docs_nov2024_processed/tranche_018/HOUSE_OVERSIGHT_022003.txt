knows, his are not in fashion and design. We frequently discuss
world trends as each of us sees them.”

“I'm on my 20th book,” said Alan Dershowitz, who’d met
Epstein in 1997. “The only person outside of my immediate fam-

But Ward also talked to other sources, who had their own
questions and qualms about Jeffrey Epstein. Some were involved
in lawsuits against him. Others had served on prestigious boards
with him. One who had witnessed Epstein’s aborted stint on the
board of Rockefeller University called him arrogant.

One powerful investment manager wondered about Epstein’s
conspicuous absence from New York’s trading floors. “The trad-
ing desks don’t seem to know him,” he says. “It’s unusual for
animals that big to not leave any footprints in the snow.”

Ward uncovered legal documents, including Epstein’s inter-
view with the SEC, given in the wake of his departure from Bear
Stearns. She visited a federal prison in Massachusetts and spoke

accusations, about Epstein’s financial practices, which Epstein
denied—and Ward knew that Hoffenberg, the Ponzi-scheme
