being morally repugnant and illegal in most countries—is simply not

! Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
International Business Transactions art. 1.1, Dec. 18, 1997, 37 LL.M. 1
[hereinafter Anti-Bribery Convention]. The Anti-Bribery Convention
requires member countries to make it a criminal offense “for any person
intentionally to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other

advantage, whether directly or through intermediaries, toa foreign
public official, for that official or for a third party, in order that the
official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of
official duties, in order to obtain or retain business or other improper
advantage in the conduct of international business.” The Convention
and its commentaries also call on all parties (a) to ensure that aiding and
abetting and authorization of an act of bribery are criminal offenses, (b)
to assert territorial jurisdiction “broadly so that an extensive physical
connection to the bribery act is not required,” and (c) to assert nationality
jurisdiction consistent with the general principles and conditions of each
party’s legal system. Jd. at art. 1.2, cmts. 25, 26.
