158 For example, DOJ has previously approved expenditures on behalf of
family members or for entertainment purposes under certain, limited
circumstances. See, e.g, U.S. DEPT. OF JUSTICE, FCPA REv. P. RELEASE
83-02 (July 26, 1983) (declining to take enforcement action against
company seeking to provide promotional tour for foreign official and
wife, where both had already planned a trip to the United States at their
own expense and company proposed to pay only for all reasonable and
necessary actual domestic expenses for the extension of their travel to
allow the promotional tour, which would not exceed $5,000), available at

159 Unlike the local law and bona fide expenditures defenses, the
facilitating payments exception is not an affirmative defense to the
FCPA. Rather, payments of this kind fall outside the scope of the
FCPA’s bribery prohibition. Prior to 1988, the “facilitating payments”
exception was incorporated into the definition of “foreign official? which
excluded from the statute's purview officials whose duties were primarily
ministerial or clerical. See Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, Pub.

L. No. 95-213, § 104(d)(2), 91 Stat. 1494, 1498 (1977) (providing that
the term foreign official “does not include any employee ofa foreign
government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof whose
duties are essentially ministerial or clerical”). The original exception thus
focused on the duties of the recipient, rather than the purpose of the
payment. In practice, however, it proved difficult to determine whether

a foreign official's duties were “ministerial or clerical.” §. REp. No. 100-
85, at 53. Responding to criticism that the statutory language “does not
clearly reflect Congressional intent and the boundaries of the prohibited
conduct.’ Congress revised the FCPA to define the exception in terms of
the purpose of the payment. H. Rep. No. 100-40, pt. 2, at 77. In doing sO,
Congress reiterated that while its policy to exclude facilitating payments
reflected practical considerations of enforcement, “such payments should
not be condoned.” /d. The enacted language reflects this narrow purpose.
10 Ty exempting facilitating payments, Congress sought to distinguish

them as “payments which merely move a particular matter toward an
eventual act or decision or which do not involve any discretionary action,”
giving the examples of “a gratuity paid to a customs official to speed the
processing of a customs document” or “payments made to secure permits,
licenses, or the expeditious performance of similar duties of an essentially
ministerial or clerical nature which must of necessity be performed in any
event.” H.R. Rep. No. 95-640, at 8.

6! Section 30A(£)(3)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 US.C. § 78dd-1(f)(3)
(B); 15 US.C. §§ 78dd-2(h) (4) (B), 78dd-3(F)(4)(B).

182 Ty a 2004 decision, the Fifth Circuit emphasized this precise point,
commenting on the limited nature of the facilitating payments exception:
A brief review of the types of routine governmental

actions enumerated by Congress shows how limited

Congress wanted to make the grease exceptions.

Routine governmental action, for instance, includes

“obtaining permits, licenses, or other official

documents to qualify a person to do business in

a foreign country,” and “scheduling inspections

associated with contract performance or inspections

related to transit of goods across country.”

‘Therefore, routine governmental action does not

include the issuance of every official document or

every inspection, but only (1) documentation that

qualifies a party to do business and (2) scheduling an

inspection—very narrow categories of largely non-

discretionary, ministerial activities performed by

mid- or low-level foreign functionaries.
