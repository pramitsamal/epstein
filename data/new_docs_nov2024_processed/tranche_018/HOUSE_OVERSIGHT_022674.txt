Over roughly the past month, coverage of Bill Clinton’s travels with financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have made
their way from a thick stack of court documents into something approaching political mythology, propelled by a string of innuendo-
laced reports hinting that the former president must have been in some way complicit when he voyaged with a billionaire known for

preying on underage girls.

It’s a story with plenty to gape at, from horrific and excruciatingly detailed allegations against Epstein to the frequent presence of a

former president who was, after all, nearly chased from office for a (consensual) affair with an intern.
