ports in the semi-rouge state of Djibouti, who had fallen
afoul of the regime and found himself in prison,
exchanged jail stories--they agreed, not as bad you’d
think. Epstein, having done his time, moved almost
seamlessly back into his life, to the shock-shock of
tabloids whenever they seemed to be reminded of his
existence (notably, when Epstein’s payment of Fergie’s
debts slipped out, likely leaked by Fergie herself).

Some things changed. While surprising few others
dropped him, the Clinton’s did, an irony of the present
tabloid interest in his old address book with its many
Clinton contacts. And his sex offender status
transformed him from libertine and playboy to
paedophile, a distinction in the current climate it is
almost impossible to argue.

While he has reguarly entertained PR proposals
aimed at his public rehabilitation, until Gates prodded
him, and then until this recent renwed tabloid fever, he
had concluded that he was perfectlysatisfied living
behind high walls and in his own exclusive club.

Even now, this new Dershowitz-Prince Andrew
chapter seems like a parralel distubance rather than
something that is actually effecting his world. “Bad
press is not something actually bad,” he notes, trying to
balance perception and reality.

And, indeed, the tabloid narrative and his own
narrative rather define wholly separate universes.

introduced the Dershowitz and Prince Andrew
