Offsetting BAT with a little math and some price increases

A company could fully offset the border adjustment tax by raising prices such that the
after-tax increase in sales would exceed the drag from the lost deduction of costs. All
else equal, the break-even price increase would be equivalent to the cost of goods sold
as a % of sales multiplied by net % imported and the tax to after-tax ratio, which at a
20% rate is 0.25 (20%/80%).

tax rate (%)
(1 — tax rate (%))

BAT price of fset = COGS (% of sales) * net import (%) *

As an example, a company with a 25% gross margin that imports 30% of its goods
would need to increase its prices by of 5-6% to offset the border adjustment tax, all
else equal.

Offsetting BAT with FX

Some of the increase in the after-tax cost of imported goods can also be offset by a
strengthening dollar. For example, companies producing goods in Mexico, which stand to
see a 25% increase in the cost of imported goods, should see the cost increase partially
offset by the 13% devaluation of the Mexican Peso against the US dollar since the
election. The net cost increase is a more digestible 9%, especially when you also
consider that the Peso has devalued nearly 30% since its 2013 peak. While it may offer
little consolation to corporates, the US Dollar Index is up over 25% since mid-2014, so
the border adjustment tax would presumably act as a reversal of the lowered cost of
overseas production over that period.

Border adjustment sensitivity analysis

The table below illustrates how the change in the tax rate and the application of the
border adjustment tax would impact the domestic earnings of a hypothetical company
with sensitivity to different tax rates and net export assumptions. We assumed the
company has a 40% gross margin, operating expenses are 20% of sales and an initial
tax rate of 35%. As you would expect, the biggest benefit would accrue to companies
with significant net exports at a high domestic tax rate (bigger tax shield) and the most
negative impact to significant net imports at a high domestic tax rate (higher taxes on
higher taxable income).
