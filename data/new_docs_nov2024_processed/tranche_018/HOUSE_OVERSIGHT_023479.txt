progress on HIV/AIDS or malaria. Yet no one takes a larger view and
asks, for example, whether existing aid programs are helping to keep
the regime in power or, conversely, are destabilizing it.

Egypt itself presents a good case of this particular form of policy
incoherence. Despite the fact that Egypt ranks as one of the top
American aid recipients, it is hard to say that Washington was
pursuing development goals of any sort there. The United States was
primarily interested in stability. Despite brave speeches on democracy
by both Condeleezza Rice and Barack Obama in Cairo, the United
States actually pulled its punches in pushing serious democratic
reform on Egypt, particularly after the Hamas electoral victory in
Gaza in 2006. Nonetheless, U.S. economic aid programs were still
pushing education and economic policy reform programs in the
country. Had American aid administrators taken the Huntingtonian
view that their assistance was covertly designed to promote an
expectations gap and delegitimate Hosni Mubarak, this might have
been a clever strategy. But no such cleverness existed. Instead, it was
simply an example of compartmentalized aid programs doing their
thing in ignorance of the interdependent effects of politics and
economics.

What Is to Be Done?

Ideas precede action. Before we can hope to generate a coherent set
of policies for Egypt, or anywhere else for that matter, we need a
better understanding of development—that is, how changes in
economy, politics and society over time constitute a set of discrete yet
interlinked processes. Whatever the shortcomings of classic
modernization theory, it at least began from the insight that the
phenomenon under study required development of a master social
science that transcended existing disciplinary boundaries. This
objective is as far away as ever in academia, where the traditional
