But he said Democrats, too, faced a credibility test. “They have held
fast to the security programs in place since the 1930s, but without
being able to successfully challenge the antitax orthodoxy,” he said.
“The problem the Democrats have is that they can no longer say with
a straight face that raising taxes on the wealthy is going to enable
them to pay over the next generation for the programs they cherish.
So what do you do?”

That question is being asked quietly within both parties, each of
which faces its own internal tensions about how to proceed.

There are Republicans who fear that voting for the Ryan plan will put
them out of step with their constituents. There are Democrats who
think the tax-and-spend label is all too accurate. There are
Republicans who might countenance voting for tax increases, and
there are Democrats who are willing to meaningfully scale back the
benefits promised by Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

In the Senate, a group of Democrats and Republicans operating
independently of party leaders is trying to come up with a plan that
neither party would like but both would accept as necessary. But they
are debating basic values; it would no doubt be much easier if the
argument was just about numbers.
