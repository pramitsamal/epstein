Zone in 1903. The new Panamanian government gave the United
States the French concession to construct the Canal, which the United

the Zone and the Canal to the Panamanians in 1977.

Portugal, Japan, Russia, Britain, and France—we can only conclude

the first one ever happened? Millions of Israelis are descendants of
those who died in the Holocaust. In 1981, when Iraq threatened
Israel, Israel’s then prime minister, Menachem Begin, ordered the
