PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO RELY ON THE PRIOR RETURNS SET FORTH
HEREIN IN MAKING A DECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO PURCHASE THE INTERESTS OFFERED
HEREBY. AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND DOES NOT REPRESENT AN INTEREST IN ANY
INDICATED INVESTMENT OR ANY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF ANY RELATED OR OTHER
INVESTMENT FUND, INCLUDING ANY INVESTMENT FUND MANAGED BY THE MANAGEMENT
COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES. WHILE THIS MEMORANDUM INCLUDES REFERENCES TO A
NUMBER OF RELATED AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES, INCLUDING CERTAIN AFFILIATED
INVESTMENT POOLS AND VEHICLES, AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND AS CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN IS SEPARATE AND DISCRETE FROM ALL SUCH OTHER AFFILIATED INVESTMENT
VEHICLES. FURTHER, ALTHOUGH THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH OTHER AFFILIATED
INVESTMENT VEHICLES MAY BE RELEVANT TO A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE
GENERAL INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY
AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUCH PERFORMANCE IS NOT AN INDICATOR OF THE RESULTS TO BE
ACHIEVED BY THE FUND.

THE RETURN INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED OR VERIFIED BY
ANY INDEPENDENT PARTY AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
RETURNS THAT MAY BE RECEIVED BY AN INVESTOR IN THE FUND. CERTAIN FACTORS EXIST
THAT MAY AFFECT COMPARABILITY INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE DEDUCTION OF FEES
AND EXPENSES AND THE PAYMENT OF CARRIED INTEREST (WHICH MAY BE DIFFERENT FOR
THE FUND) AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AS NOTED WITH SUCH INFORMATION. FURTHER,
CERTAIN INFORMATION RESPECTING UNREALIZED RETURNS IS BASED ON PUBLIC MARKET
VALUATIONS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY VOLATILE AND
AS A RESULT MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE CURRENT VALUE OR THE ACTUAL VALUE TO
BE REALIZED FROM ANY PARTICULAR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT.

PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD NOT CONSTRUE THE CONTENTS OF THE MEMORANDUM
AS LEGAL, TAX, REGULATORY, FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING OR OTHER ADVICE. EACH
PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD MAKE ITS OWN INVESTIGATION AND CONSULT ITS OWN
ADVISORS AS TO THE LEGAL, TAX, REGULATORY, FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING AND RELATED
MATTERS CONCERNING THE FUND, THE OFFERING AND AN INVESTMENT IN THE INTERESTS.
THIS INVESTMENT INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND IS SUITABLE ONLY FOR
INVESTORS WHO ARE SOPHISTICATED WITH FINANCIAL MATTERS AND FAMILIAR WITH THE
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS SIMILAR TO THE ONES DESCRIBED HEREIN. NONE OF
THE FUND, THE GENERAL PARTNER, THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY OR ANY OF THEIR
AFFILIATES IS MAKING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY TO AN INVESTOR REGARDING
THE LEGALITY OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND BY SUCH INVESTOR OR ABOUT THE
INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF SUCH AN INVESTMENT.

UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN RESPECTING
RATES OF RETURN OR OTHER PERFORMANCE DATA, WHETHER REALIZED OR UNREALIZED,
IS QUALIFIED BY THE RELEVANT APPENDICES, FOOTNOTES, AND ENDNOTES HEREIN AND IS
ON A GROSS RETURN BASIS BEFORE GIVING EFFECT TO MANAGEMENT FEES, CARRIED
INTEREST, OTHER EXPENSES AND TAXES, WHICH, IF GIVEN EFFECT TO, WOULD REDUCE SUCH
RETURNS AND, IN THE AGGREGATE, ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIAL. WHERE NET
RETURNS ARE PROVIDED, SUCH RETURNS GIVE EFFECT TO MANAGEMENT FEES, CARRIED
INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSES. FURTHER, INFORMATION RESPECTING INVESTMENT
PERFORMANCE IS BASED ON CERTAIN INVESTMENT POSITIONS SELECTED AS
REPRESENTATIVE AND ANALOGOUS TO THE TARGETED INVESTMENT CATEGORIES FOR THE
FUND. SUCH INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF
INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY NEW LEAF AND ITS AFFILIATED INVESTMENT MANAGERS IN
OTHER INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED HEREIN.
