A UDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

The Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. The Audit Committee is composed of three independent
directors (as defined by the New York Stock Exchange Listing Standards), met nine times in 2018, and operates under a written charter, which is posted on
our website at investors.carvana.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents. As provided in the charter, the Audit Committee’s oversight
responsibilities include monitoring the integrity of our financial statements (including reviewing financial information, the systems of internal controls, the
audit process, and the independence and performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm) and our compliance
with legal and regulatory requirements. However, management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process,
including our systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee

* reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, with our management;

* discussed with our independent auditors, Grant Thornton LLP, the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (“PCAOB”) Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees); and

* received the written disclosures and the letter from Grant Thornton LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Grant
Thornton LLP’s communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Grant Thornton LLP the
independence of Grant Thornton LLP.

Based on the Audit Committee’s review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the
audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
