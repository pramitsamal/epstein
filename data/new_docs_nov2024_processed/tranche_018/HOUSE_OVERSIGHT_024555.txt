14.11. Tax Distributions

The General Partner may decide to make a tax distribution from KUE on or before April 1st of any year
following a taxable year in which net taxable income was allocated to any Partner. If the General Partner
decides to make a tax distribution, then KUE will distribute cash available for distribution, if any, to those
Partners receiving an allocation of net taxable income, regardless of whether such net taxable income is
actually subject to tax. The amount of net taxable income upon which such a tax distribution will be made
will be based on cumulative calculation of net taxable income and net taxable loss which have been
allocated to each such Partner from the inception of KUE. Any tax distributions received by a Pariner will
be treated as an advance and will offset against any other distributions such Partner is entitled to receive
from KUE.
