but the transaction occurred outside the date range of the analysis. Due to the size of the transaction, it is worth noting here.

= Public Capital Markets: United States

As of November 30, 2017, four cannabis-related companies were trading on Nasdaq (all in the phar-
maceutical industry and focused on receiving FDA approval for selected cannabinoid applications),
one was trading on the NYSE (a real estate investment trust, or REIT, focused on the acquisition and
management of properties leased to state-licensed operators for their regulated medical-use cannabis
facilities), two were trading on the NYSE American (both in the pharmaceutical industry) and more
than 200 cannabis-related companies were trading on the OTC.

Most of the companies trading on the OTC (i) are “penny” stocks that trade at less than $5.00 per
share, (ii) have limited trading volume and liquidity, (iii) have significant price volatility, and (iv) have
little or no institutional investor support. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have historically expressed concerns regarding
the “penny” stock industry in general and both have issued alerts to warn investors about potential
scams associated with purported cannabis-related stocks. In addition, the SEC has initiated actions
against numerous purported cannabis-related companies and executives for fraud, insider trading,
stock manipulation and other activities.

The following table provides a summary of cannabis-related companies traded on the U.S. stock
markets.
