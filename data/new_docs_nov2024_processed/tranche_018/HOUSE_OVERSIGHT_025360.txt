prosecution is fair and appropriate has been placed, once again, in U.S. Attorney Acosta’s
hands.

In light of the foregoing, we respectfully ask that you review this matter and discontinue
all federal involvement so that the State can appropriately bring this matter to closure. We
would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss these important issues.
Such a meeting would provide the Department with an opportunity to review the paramount
issues of federalism and the appearance of selectivity that are generated by the unprecedented
attempts to broaden the ambit of federal statutes to places that they have never before reached.
We sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter.

Respectfully submitted,

MLA! WL. Oh
