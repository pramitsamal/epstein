Do Cryptocurrencies Meet the Criteria for Currencies? Menssonent
2) Bitcoin is an Unreliable Unit of Account Division

Illustrative Pricing: US$ vs. Bitcoin as a Unit of Account

January 2nd 2017: November 14th 2017:
1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin =
$1,012 = $6,590 =
1 Bosch Dishwasher ($1,079) 6 Bosch Dishwashers ($6,474)

= Bitcoin’s rapid appreciation makes it an unsatisfactory candidate as a unit of account.

= In January, one could have purchased a dishwasher for one bitcoin. Today, it would cost 1/6 a bitcoin to buy the
unit, implying severe deflation over the past several months.

= In deflationary environments, people hoard their money in order to buy goods more cheaply at a later date, which has
prompted most people to hoard their bitcoin.
