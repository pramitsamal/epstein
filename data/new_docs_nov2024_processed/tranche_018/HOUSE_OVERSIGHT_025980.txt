The GESI Risk Allocator favours being underweight risk assets given the distribution of
stresses within the GFSI. The percentages of Bullish, Bearish and Neutral GFSI
components (as used in the Risk Allocator) were 8.7%, 13.0% & 78.3%, respectively as
of 5-Aug. The Risk Allocator (using Bull, Bear & Neutral weights of 2, 0, 1) suggests
reducing the underweight position to 4.3% UW from last week’s 17.4% UW.
