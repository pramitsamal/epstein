Yes, we can expect more extremists to run under RCV. But also more centrists (e.g., Bloomberg). Since the
centrists are closer to the median voter, they will defeat the extremists.

The evidence I have seen suggests that RCV increases turn-out. [But it’s important that voters be given the
choice to rank as many or few candidates as they like, so that a voter always has the option of voting for a
single candidate (in effect, he would be ranking all other candidates as tied for second). In practice, most voters
choose to rank two or three candidates, but a significant fraction just rank one]

In fact the increase in the diversity of candidates under RCV is related to turn-out. If RCV had been used in
2016, Bernie Sanders could have run as an independent in the general election without fear of guaranteeing a
Trump victory. Many of the Bernie supporters who stayed home on election day might then have voted---and
presumably would have ranked Clinton second. This would have given Ker a victory over Trump in Michigan,
Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania (and possibly elsewhere).

I get that formal argument

What about aspects not quite in model.

More folk will run from extremes if they can attract more First run votes. Candidates can position a bit.
Separately I pitched this to someone today.

He said he had heard that because of its greater complexity African American and lower income turnout was
depressed. Is there evidence on turnout impacts?
