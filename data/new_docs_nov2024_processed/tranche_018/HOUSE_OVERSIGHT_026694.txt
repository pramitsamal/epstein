Sovereigns are targeting markets offering security
and growth

Traditionally sovereigns have grouped countries by
economic development or geographic region to form
their overall geographic allocations. Indeed, last
year, we highlighted increased allocations to North
America, based on perceptions of the US as a ‘safe
haven’ for sovereign assets, driven by the strength

of its currency and positive tax changes for
international investors.

While at a high level, sovereigns have been
unwilling to adjust regional allocations (as outlined in
theme 1), idiosyncratic geopolitical risks are causing
sovereigns to reweight to countries within these
allocation bands. In developed markets, uncertainty
over global interest rates is shifting this focus to
identifying markets to shelter assets (as shown by
the increased attractiveness of the US and Germany
in figure 7), with Brexit and the US election cited as
the factors of fastest growing importance to asset
allocation (growing importance cited by 82% and
68% of sovereigns respectively). Similarly, emerging
markets sovereigns are identifying countries with the
greatest potential for long-term economic growth.
