His rather purple prose still resonates more than a hundred years later. Were he
writing today he would have been elated by our expanded vision of life and the

tried to offer in this lecture.

MEDAWAR

But we mustn’t leap from denial to despair. So I give the last word to another sage:

“The bells that toll for mankind are ............. like the bells of Alpine cattle. They are

attached to our own necks, and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and
melodious sound.”
