China goes big in Pakistan...

- China, in an effort
counter India, build
additional shipping
points and expand

trade, has just arranged

for a $46 billion

investment in pipelines

from one end of

Pakistan to the coastal

city of Gwadar.
- India is not happy

we suspect al-Qaeda
and ISIS in the northern
region are not happy

about this, either.

- Will China build a
naval port, too? We
believe so.
