RLK: This has caused a deep scar in
the Chinese psyche. So you have all
of these factors coming together —
but I can tell you the public stance
of the government, of Jack Ma we

have to be.

RLK: If you look at what President
Trump said, that is not a public
posture for seeking solution. Not
just saying tariffs will go up to 25
percent in January will go up, but
then threatening if you retaliate at
all, we're going to levy tariffs on
everything else [$500+ billion
Chinese goods]. That's a very
aggressive stance and China really
has no choice.
