Hello Jeffrey —

| hope all is well with you. As per Peggy Siegal’s office, | have included here the invitation to the IFP Gotham Awards
ceremony, which will be held on Monday, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City.

This year’s ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn’t be more thrilled with this year’s impressive
group of Tributees. The Actress Tribute will go to Nicole Kidman and the Actor Tribute to Dustin Hoffman. The
Director Tribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the
Industry Tribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn’t be more
pleased to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year’s special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year
