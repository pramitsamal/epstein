So....remarkably...in the middle of dealing with thiss the Steptoe numbercrunchers advise me Jeffrey has paid about
450 and owes about 300 and seems disinclined to make Steptoe whole.....Ahhhhmmmm....first reaction is déja vu....
How the fuck are we back here after the unspeakably awful evan barr debacle.... More to the point just tell me
where you are on this....did miller fuck up? Something else? As you know | am the 800 pound gorilla here, Steptoe
is not going to chase you down for the money but there are 500 lawyers here, processes, etc......
