We are working on getting the following article placed in the Hill or the Politico within the next week. As of now it looks
like former Chairman of Armed Services, Congressman Ron Dellums, will be the author. Please keep highly

confidential. Will keep you posted on if, when and where it gets published. Once it is published we can all circulate it
highly. We believe that this article sets the tone for the advocacy we will be doing and having someone very prominent
like Congressman Dellums will also be a great way to launch this campaign.

Congressman Ronald Dellums is a thirteen term Member of the U.S. House of Representatives (D-CA) who
served from 1971-1998. He also served as the 48th Mayor of Oakland from 2007-2011. Dellums served as the
Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on the District of Columbia. He
also served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence and co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus.
