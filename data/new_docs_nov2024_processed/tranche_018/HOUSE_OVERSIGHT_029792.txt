his consultations with the country's
political parties and charged Benjamin
Netanyahu with forming a new coalition,
Israel’s respected President, Shimon
Peres, is once again very much in the
news. In his speech inviting Netanyahu to
form the next government, the President
spoke forcefully about peace and even
seemed to influence Bibi to mention
peace, a word he never used in his
election campaign. Peres has rightly
earned respect for this from many
quarters, but now, as the coalition is
being formed, it might be a good time to
examine one aspect of Israel’s political

administrations—even as a junior
partner—rather than lead the opposition,

“national responsibility.” Now is surely
a better time to criticize Peres than in
June, when the world (maybe even
including President Barack Obama) will
be coming here to celebrate his 90th
birthday. Then, surely, everyone will be
paying deserved tribute to the wisdom of
this elder statesman and prophet of peace,
and it would be a shame to spoil the
