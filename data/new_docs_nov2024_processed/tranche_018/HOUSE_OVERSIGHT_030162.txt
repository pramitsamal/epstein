online. The result is that an old guard now confronts a new wave, and
the two sides think entirely differently and speak at cross-purposes.
Whatever the new wave’s limitations, its borderless online
conversations are offsetting the region’s political, religious, social,
and cultural balkanization. The people of West Asia and North Africa
are talking among themselves, even if their governments remain
remote. That is a source of hope, if not yet of the systematic and
coherent ideas about how to remake their societies that the region
needs.

Cyber-activism has its limits; it cannot, in the end, deliver either
democracy or prosperity. Communication may be instant, but, with
no coherent animating ideology, the revolution proceeds in slow
motion. The battle being fought for the soul of the Middle East
cannot be won online, nor can it be subdued through the cynical
manipulation of trust and fear. The quality of freedom in the Middle
East, as elsewhere, will depend on its supporters’ commitment to
liberal and democratic values.

HRH Prince El Hassan bin Talal is chairman and founder of the
Arab Thought Forum and the West Asia-North Africa Forum.
