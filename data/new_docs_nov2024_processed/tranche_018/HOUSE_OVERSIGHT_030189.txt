Lenny was writing an autobiography--How to Talk Dirty and
Influence People--which Playboy planned to serialize, then publish as a
book, and they hired me as his editor. We met in Atlantic City, where he
was taking Delaudid for lethargy, and he sent a telegram to a contact, with
a phrase--DE LAWD IN DE SKY--as a code to send a doctor's prescription.

At a certain point he was acting paranoid and demanded that | take
a lie-detector test, and | was paranoid enough to take him literally. |
couldn't work with him if he didn't trust me. We got into an argument, and
| left.

He sent a telegram that sounded like we were on the verge of
divorce. “WHY CAN'T IT BE THE WAY IT USED TO BE?” he wrote. | agreed
to try again, and in 1962 | flew to Chicago. Lenny was performing at the
Gate of Horn, where he was asking the whole audience to take a lie-
detector test.

Lenny was intrigued by the implications of an item in 7he Realist, an
actual statement by Adolf Eichmann that he would have been “not only a
scoundrel, but a despicable pig” if he hadn't carried out Hitler's orders.
Lenny wrote a piece for 7he Realist “Letter From a Soldier's Wife,”
namely Mrs. Eichmann pleading for compassion to spare her husband's

life.
