To summarize, we expect today’s margins to last a while longer, since relative costs won’t converge overnight. But we are not
inclined to pay a high multiple for them, given their reliance on weak labor compensation, which in turn requires large
government transfers. The good news: markets are not applying high multiples right now, which is why we own the equities
we do. However, questions about the large but shrinking public sector toolkit knock 10%-15% off of our equity
allocations, compared to where we would normally expect to be 2 years after a recession. We walk through 4 instances
of this below, as it relates to US fiscal policy, oil prices, Chinese inflation and the European periphery.

Twilight of the Gods, part 1: Limited room for fiscal policy to invigorate the US recovery
Here’s what we know for sure about the US Federal debt ceiling debate:

e The government is facing the unappealing task of having to increase the Federal debt ceiling above 100% of GDP for the
first time since the end of WWII, and only the second time since the debt ceiling was established in 1917

e The government has already run out of money from traditional sources. As shown below, since May 16, 2011, the US
Treasury has been raiding the cash, securities and borrowing capacity of government employee retirement and other funds.
Of $270 billion of such balances which existed in May, around 75% has already been used up. There’s not much leeway
left, which is why the government will probably run out of money some time in August.

e The debate about the existing Federal debt is the lesser of two problems. As shown on the following page, the present value
of unfunded entitlement obligations (e.g., future debt) dwarfs the existing debt. That’s why there’s so much talk about a
deal to stabilize the long term trajectory of the budget deficit.

The rest is all speculation. The table on the next page shows the revenue and spending factors in play. It’s too early to know
what kind of deal will be crafted. We believe that the deal with be composed of 80% spending cuts and 20% revenue/tax
increases (rather than 50-50), and will be closer to $2 trillion than $4 trillion. While it’s possible that another dose of fiscal
stimulus will be built into the debt ceiling agreement, it might not be that large, and its impact could easily be offset by a
subdued consumer response due to expectations of higher taxes in the long run (e.g., Ricardian equivalence).
