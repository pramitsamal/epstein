Religion, including Hinduism and Islam, can help Indians define their
individual identity. But in a country of such size and diversity, one that is
home to a third of the world’s poor, only secular rule can ensure the unity
needed to fulfill people’s collective hopes.

“India has won,” Modi tweeted after his victory. This apparent humility
may serve him well in preventing an overreach of his powers. India does
not need big-man style rule now that a historic election has shown Indians
are ready to dream big.

Will it be Cyprus’ year?
Yusuf Kanli

19 May 2014 -- The highlight of the one-day trip to North Cyprus by
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu might best be his bold declaration that
time has come to end the 50-year-old Cyprus problem. Can there be
relevance between the age and the time for the resolution of a problem?
Obviously not, but a minister expressing conviction that time has come to
end a problem carries incredible importance and naturally boosts
expectations to that end.

Is it really the high time, best opportunity, right moment, last chance or
whatever for a Cyprus deal? All through the past many decades, somehow
many prominent and otherwise effective personalities, including not only
Davutoglu and people of his caliber, but many premiers, presidents and at
least every American leader since George Bush Sr. have declared many of
the past years as the “Cyprus year” but that Cyprus year never came...
Will it come this time? Sure... the Cyprus problem could easily be
resolved if the two sides on the island ever develop sufficient political
will; prepare their respective societies to be receptive to a painful
compromise and international actors stop paying lip service to the idea of
a resolution, but instead genuinely support a resolution.
