Federal Judge throws out Stormy Danials [sic] lawsuit versus Trump. Trump is entitled to full legal fees.’
@FoxNews Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas. She will
confirm the letter she signed! She knows nothing about me, a total con!' he tweeted.

The tweet comes one day after a federal judge in California threw out Daniels's defamation lawsuit against
Trump and ordered Daniels to repay the president's legal fees.

Daniels's attorney, Michael Avenatti, responded by calling Trump a disgusting misogynist and a liar who
has dishonored his family and country.

You are a disgusting misogynist and an embarrassment to the United States. Bring everything you have,
because we are going to demonstrate to the world what a complete shyster and liar you are. How many other
women did you cheat on your wife with while you had a baby at home? he tweeted.
