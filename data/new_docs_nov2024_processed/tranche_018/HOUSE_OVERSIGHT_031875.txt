Israel's reality is this. It is a small country, yet must manage threats
arising far outside of its region. It can survive only if it maneuvers
with great powers commanding enormously greater resources. Israel
cannot match the resources and, therefore, it must be constantly
clever. There are periods when it is relatively safe because of great
power alignments, but its normal condition is one of global unease.
No nation can be clever forever, and Israel's history shows that some
form of subordination is inevitable. Indeed, it is to a very limited
extent subordinate to the United States now.

For Israel, the retention of a Davidic independence is difficult. Israel's
strategy must be to manage its subordination effectively by dealing
with its patron cleverly, as it did with Persia. But cleverness is not a
geopolitical concept. It is not permanent, and it is not assured. And
that is the perpetual crisis of Jerusalem.
