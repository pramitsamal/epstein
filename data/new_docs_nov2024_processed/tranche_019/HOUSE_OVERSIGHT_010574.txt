15. One of Mr. Epstein’s household employees, Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez, saw
numerous underage girls coming into Epstein’s mansion for purported “massages.” See
Rodriguez Depo. at 242-44 (Deposition Attachment #8). Rodriguez was aware that “sex toys”
and vibrators were found in Epstein’s bedroom after the purported massages. Jd. at 223-28.
Rodriguez thought what Epstein was doing was wrong, given the extreme youth of the girls he
saw. Id. at 230-31..

16. Alfredo Rodriguez took a journal from Epstein’s computer that reflected many of
the names of underage females Epstein abused across the country and the world, including
locations such as Michigan, California, West Palm Beach, New York, New Mexico, and Paris,
France. See Journal (hereinafter “The Journal” or “Holy Grail”) (Exhibit “F”) (identifying,
among other Epstein acquaintances, females that Rodriguez believes were underage under the
heading labeled Massages).

17. Rodriguez was later charged in a criminal complaint with obstruction of justice in
connection with trying to obtain $50,000 from civil attorneys pursuing civil sexual assault cases
against Epstein as payment for producing the book to the attorneys. See Criminal Complaint at
2, U.S. v. Rodriguez, No. 9:10-CR-80015-KAM (S.D. Fla. 2010) (Exhibit “G”). Rodriguez
stated he needed money because the journal was his “property” and that he was aftaid that
Jeffrey Epstein would make him “disappear” unless he had an “insurance policy” (i.e., the
journal). Jd. at 3. Because of the importance of the information in the journal to the civil cases,
Mr. Rodriguez called it “The Holy Grail.”
