BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Mr. Dershowitz --

MR. SCOTT: You're cutting the witness
off.

MR. SCAROLA: He's not answering my
question, Tom.

MR. SCOTT: Well --

MR. SCAROLA: I want to know whether the
last name is spelled the same or it isn’t
spelled the same on the flight tog marked as an
exhibit and on the photographs. That's a very
direct question. It calls for a very direct
yes or no response.

And this witness has demonstrated a clear
refusal to respond directly to direct
questions, which will result, when we resume
this deposition, in our requesting that the
Court appoint a special master so that this
deposition doesn't take two weeks to complete.

MR. SCOTT: You know, Mr. Scarola, that's
a nice speech and I appreciate it.

MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.

MR. SCOTT: I don't agree with your

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Is the last name on the photograph spelled
exactly the same way as the last name on the flight
log?

A. If you're talking about a flight log that
1 was not on that flight, the answer is yes.

Q. Allright. Thank you very nwch, sir.

Now, that flight log also shows you flying
repeatedly in the company of a woman named Tatiana,
correct?

A. I've only seen one reference to Tatiana on
November 17. If you want to show me any other
references, I'd be happy to look at them.

Q. Allright, sir. Thank you.

Let's go back to the —

MR. SCOTT: Are we done with this exhibit?

MR. SCAROLA: We are done with the
exhibit.

MR. SCOTT: Okay. Then let's collect the
exhibits so that we don't have a big -- then

we'll turn them over to the court reporter to

keep safekeeping.

There you go, young lady, don't lose
those, don't get them wet. And we'll proceed.

characterization. And if you recall, months

ago I suggested a special master for this

deposition, for your clients’ depositions and

for Virginia Roberts’ and your response to me

was: I'll consider it, I won't pay for it. If

your client wants to pay for it -- so basically

you blew me off.

So, I appreciate you finally come around.
And your clients.

MR. SCAROLA: Your client's misconduct has
clearly convinced me, having now considered it,
that it is absolutely necessary.

MR. SCOTT: Okay. Now --

Q. So new could I get an answer to my
question ~~

MR. SCOTT: Now that we have --

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. -- whether the last name on the flight log
is spelled exactly the same way as the last name in
the photographs?

MR. SCOTT: Now that all the lawyers'

speeches are done, read the question back and

the witness will answer it.
MR. SCAROLA: | will repeat the question.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Did you state during the same interview,
the CNN Don Lemon interview: She has said that
Bill Clinton was with her at an orgy on Jeffrey's
island?

A. I did state that, yes.

Q. Was that statement intended as fact,
opinion, or was it intended as rhetorical hyperbole?

MR. SCOTT: Do you understand the
question?
THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.

A. It was a statement based on what I

believed were the facts at the time I said them.

Various newspapers and blogs had placed
Bill Clinton on, quote, orgy island on -- in the
presence of Jeffrey Epstein when there were orgies.
And at the time | made that statement, | hada
belief that she had accused Bill Clinton of
participating or being -- as being a part of or an
observer or -- or a Witness or a participant in
orgies on what was called Jeffrey Epstein's orgy
island. That was my state of belief, honest belief
at the time I made that statement.

Q. Yes, sir, And what I want to knew is what
