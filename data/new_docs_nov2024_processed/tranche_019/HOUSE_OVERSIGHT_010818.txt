Q. December 11, 2000, PBI to Teterboro,
passengers, Jeffrey Epstein --

A. Wait asecond. | have to find it.

MR. SCOTT: Well, let him -- let him read
the exhibit.
A. What -- what's the date?
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. December 11.

A. December 11. Yes, I see that.

Q. Palm Beach International Airport to
Teterboro?

A. Right, yeah.

Q. Passengers, Jeffrey Epstein?

A. Right,

Q. GM, a reference to Ghislaine -- excuse me,
Ghislaine Maxwell.

A. Uh-huh.

Q. And ET and Virginia, right?

A. That's what it says, yes, sir.

Q. And then we see three of the same four
passengers leaving the New York area.

A. Uh-huh.

Q. To fly to another destination three days
later on December 14, correct?

A. Yes.

318

Q. And let's look at the next page of your
wife's diary for December 13, the period of time
when the flight log shows Jeffrey Epstein and
Virginia in New York --

A. Uh-huh.

Q. --at the same time when it would appear
that you were in New York. And at the bottom of
this calendar, Wednesday, December 13, A.D.,
massage, right?

A. 10:00 a.m. it says? What is it?

Q. It says 10, 10-A.D. massage?

A. Yeah.

Q. Okay.

Let's go to the next composite.

A. I don't have -- there's another page after
that. Oh, the next composite.

Q. Yes, sir.

A. Yeah.

Q. Composite Number 10.

A. Uh-huh. But -- but I just want to be
clear. So you're saying Carolyn was with me in
New York during that period of time.

Q. No, I'm not saying that at all, sir. I
suggest that when we take a close look at the
calendar, it's going to reveal something other than

319

that, but that you were in New York at the same time
Jeffrey Epstein --

A. And that Carolyn --

Q. -- and Virginia were in New York and you
were --

A. And that Carolyn arranged for a massage.

Q. — having a massage.

A, And that my wife arranged for a massage.

Q. No, I didn't say that at all, sir?

MR. SCOTT: Well, that’s what he's saying

that the record reflects.

A. The record --

MR. SCOTT: Don't cut him off.

A. -- reflects that Carolyn -- Carolyn always
wanted me to have massages because she thought it
would relax me. I don't like massages particularly,
but when Carolyn arranged massages, almost always we
had them together at the same time. We would have
the same masseuse, sometimes a man, sometimes a
woman, come to the house and give us massages
together.

The idea that my wife would arrange for me
to have a massage with an underage girl for sexual
purposes is so bizarre and absurd as to defy any
kind of credibility, but go on.

BY MR. SCAROLA:
Q. Yes. Thank you very much, sir.
A. Goon.
Q. Lintend --

MR. SCOTT: Since you're both smiling,
there seemis to be some humor that I'm missing
here. I guess I --

MR. SCAROLA: Well, I'm missing the humor
too.

BY MR. SCAROLA:
Q. Let's go to Composite Exhibit Number 10.
A. Yeah.
Q. The first page of that composite exhibit

is a photocopy of pages from your personal calendar

in January 2001, correct?
A. That's right, yes.
Q. Another Court TV appearance on January 11,
correct?
A. January 1}.
Q. Yes, sir. Thursday, January 11, entry in
the left-hand column, Court TV.
A. Entry on -- yes, January -- I see it as --
I see it on January 12. I don't sec it on
January 11, but...
