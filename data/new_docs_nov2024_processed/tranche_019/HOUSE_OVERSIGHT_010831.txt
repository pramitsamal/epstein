013522 1 what I'll refer to as the blank-check immunity

013533 2 provision.

or3saa 3 There was a provision in the nonprosecution
013533 4 agreement that said, this agreement will prevent federal
o3s4o 5 prosecution for international and interstate sex

o13543 6 trafficking, not only of Jeffrey Epstein, and not only
ossss 7 of the four women who were identified, but -- and this
ossaa «8 = is. a direct quote: Any other potential co-conspirator,
013553 9 close quote.

oss 10 And so that was unusual because what it --
o3ss7 11. whatit seemed to be doing was that somehow this

a13658 12 agreement was quite out of the normal and had been
o13600 13 designed to extend immunity to other people that might
o136.03 14 have been associated with Epstein.

orze0s 15 And I knew that that category included the
o13600 16 people that were involved in negotiating this highly
o13611 17 unusual provision included Mr. Dershowitz, who had been
oe 18 heavily involved, not only in the drafting of the

or3618 19 agreement, but had also been involved remarkably in
013622 20 attacking the credibility of these girls and saying

o13e25 21 things like, you know, it was -- Epstein wasn't

013628 22 targeting minor girls, which just struck -- you know, I
013633 23 was -- 1 don't want to use a technical term,

013623 24 gob-smocked, that a defense attorney with an obligation

o3ea2 1 that Jeffrey Epstein was not targeting minor girls, when
orse4a4 2 the Palm Beach Police Department had collected, you
oe 3 know, 23 of them that had all given essentially

ov3zeso 4 interlocking stories about how they had all gone over to
oiz654 5 this house, you know, the mansion, to give a massage and
ovzes7 6 when they had gotten there, they had been sexually

ovsess «47 abused.

orsess 8 So the kingpin wouldn't talk. The next

o3701 9 echelon of the trafficking organization wouldn't talk.
013703 10 So the next step was to say, okay, let's see if we can
or3706 11 find somebody, you know, lower level in there, you know,
osros 12 a household employee or something like that; maybe they
or3710 13 - will have some information about, you know, what this
ov3712 14 criminal organization is doing.

ors71a 15 Now, let's -- let's understand, you know,

013716 16 given the pervasiveness of the -- of the criminal

ors719 17 «= oaactivity, I -- I wasn't convinced that they were going
013721 18 to be able to get in there and start saying exactly what

013728 20 «= themselves to criminal -- you know, criminal

or3720 24 culpability.

ors730 22 But I -- I was able to read a sworn

01:37:32 23 deposition from Juan Alessi, and Juan Alessi -~ I

013737 24 think -- I don't know. Maybe just to speed things up

that are said there, but Alessi puts Mr. Dershowitz at

the nest of this international sex trafficking
organization. Let's see. I think he said four or five
times a year, two or three -- you know, two or three
days when he goes there,

And let's be clear, I know Mr. Dershowitz had
said at some points like, I'm an attorney, and that's my
client and so forth. And Alessi said, no, but this was

notin a -- in a lawyer/client capacity; this is in a

friend capacity.

And so now we have Alessi putting him there

at the same time when young girls were there. And one

of the -- the -- the things that I picked up, so is

Alessi -- you know, is he able te figure out who these

girls are?

A photograph of Virginia Roberts is shown to

Juan Alessi in the deposition, and he I.D.s the

photograph as, you know, V.R., so he -- he had, you

know, put two and two together.

So now I've got V.R. coming to the house at a

time when Mr, Dershowitz is also in the house, and

apparently spending, you know, two to three nights there

and doing this four or five times a year.

Now, Alessi wasn't the only one. There was
Alfredo Rodriguez who was there in about 2004 to 2005,

after the time period of Virginia Roberts, but it's part
of the common scheme or plan that we've been discussing
here.

And so in 2005, Alfredo Rodriguez says, yeah,
again, Mr. Dershowitz is there at a time when these
massages are going on. When you start to look at Alessi
and Rodriguez's statements in context where they're --
they're saying he's there at the same time the massages
are occurring, and with the West Palm Beach Police
Department reports showing that massages are of a sexual
nature, again, it started to put two and two together.

One of the things that was particularly
important about Rodriguez's situation was that Rodriguez
had an access to what's been called the little black
book, or I think he referred to it as the holy grail.

This was Jeffrey Epstein's, you know, telephone book
where he had telephone numbers in it.

And so Rodriguez had that and, you know, I
guess thought that this would be worth a lot of money
because it would -- you know, it would identify all of
the people that have been sexually abused by -- by
Jeffrey Epstein. And so he tried to sellit. The FBI
busted him for that.

And when the FBI busted him, now he's got
this book. And so the book went to Alessi, and
