All this has assumed has assumed constant cash flow indefinitely. That would imply
zero growth. Only under zero growth do output and rate of return simplify to cash

flow and cash flow rate.

Now let’s model growth in. | divide the Y rule by total capital, as in Chapter 4, to get

output __ total capital growth + cash flow
total capital total capital total capital ’

or more compactly

rate of return = growth rate + cash flow rate. (7.8)

At the collective scale, cash flow rate simplifies to pure consumption rate. That

would be written

rate of return = growth rate + pure consumption rate, (7.9)

as in Chapter 4. Then (7.6) through (7.9) allow

rate of return = growth rate + 3.5%/year (7.10)

at the collective scale.

(7.10) would be wrong if growth rate were a function of cash flow rate. | said that
politicians, and even economists to a degree, teach that faster growth needs

consumption restraint first. That corresponds to cash flow restraint in (7.10). Free
