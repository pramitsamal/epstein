(A1.1), (A1.6), (A1.7) and (A1.8) are alternative statements of the total return

truism.

In general, define g(Q)=Q/Q for any variable Q. Note again that g in this book

means growth rate of capital g(K,) rather than output. g in macro tradition usually
means growth of output g(Y). Total capital K,. is the sum of human capital H and

physical capital K. Their outputs respectively are work W and (net) profit P. Their
counterparts to (A1.1) and (A1.6a) are

W=H+F(H), r(H)=g(H)+f(H), P=K+F(K) and r{K)=g(K)+f(K), (A1.8)

where F(H), f(H), F(K) and f(K) are respectively “human cash flow”, “human cash

flow rate”, “physical cash flow” and “physical cash flow rate”.

Present Value and Present Cost

If there were no such thing as time preference, present and future value would be
the same. All economists known to me concede that we prefer present goods to
future ones, although some like Joseph Schumpter have seen no good reason why. |

suggest a reason in next generation theory.

Present value theory, understood in essence by the Sumerians, considers what we

now call future positive cash flows which are expected to be generated from

external investments (transfer in, negative cash flow) made now or earlier. At the

differential (infinitesimal) scale, we can write the associated future value as
dFV(z)=F (z)dz (2.1)

at future moment z. The basic idea of present value PV is
