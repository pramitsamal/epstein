Conclusion

On February 25, 2008, I sent-you an e-mail setting forth a timetable for moving forward in
the event that CEOS disagreed with your position. That time is now. As you know, my February 25
email stated that I would give you one week to comply with the terms and conditions of the
Agreement, as modified by the USA’s December 19 letter to Ms. Sanchez. In light of the upcoming
Memorial Day weekend, I have decided to extend that timetable to the close of business on Monday,
June 2, 2008, which is a full two weeks.

Sincerely,

R. Alexander Acosta
United States Attorney
