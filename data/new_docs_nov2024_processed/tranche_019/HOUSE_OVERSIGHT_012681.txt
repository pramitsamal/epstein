our follow up telephone conversation after the meeting, a plea to two federal misdemeanors was
never extended or meant as an offer.

We also would reiterate that the agreement to Section 2255 liability applies to all of the minor
girls identified during the federal investigation, not just the 12 that form the basis of an initial
planned charging instrument.

As you know, the ability to engage in flexible plea negotiations is dramatically changed upon the
return of an indictment. Once an indictment is returned, the Office does not intend to file a
Superseding Information containing a lesser charge or to dismiss the case in favor of state
prosecution.

Please let us know your client’s decision by no later than August 17. I have conferred with U.S.
Attorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of incarceration is a
non-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time, he is not inclined to
meet with counsel for Mr. Epstein.

Sincerely,

R. Alexander Acosta
United States Attorney
