As any adrenaline junkie knows, skydiving is the ultimate thrill: Those
few seconds during free fall are as close to flying as we humans will
probably ever get. Now imagine hurling yourself out of a plane at 29,500
feet - in full view of Mount Everest. To call ita rush would be an
understatement, but tour company Everest Skydive makes this once-in-
a-lifetime experience possible. During this 10-night/11-day tour,
beginning in Kathmandu, you'll get your bearings on the ground with
some sightseeing and then hike up to the drop site, where the true
adventure begins. And with all the details - accommodations, gear,
professional instruction - taken care of, skydivers can simply enjoy the
(truly unforgettable) moment.
