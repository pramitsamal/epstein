Chapter 4:
Wicked in waiting

The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they

— Bible, Psalm 53:8

Growing up is a lottery. No one has a say over their genes or their parents, including the environment that
is created on their behalf. For individuals raised in poverty, abused by parents or abandoned by them,
there may come a time when it is possible to purge the past, rise above it, and lay down new tracks.
Success in this endeavor depends upon biological potential and the environment’s toxicity. Though every
healthy human being acquires the same basic biological ingredients, individual differences in how our
biology expresses itself can either provide immunity against toxic environments or deep vulnerabilities.
The unlucky ones inherit genes that predispose to sensation-seeking and risk-taking, callous and
unemotional attitudes toward others, weak self-control, and narcissistic leanings. With this lottery ticket,
it takes little to trigger the mindset of an evildoer. And yet some resist. An impressive accumulation of
scientific evidence helps explain the source of these individual differences, including its role in sculpting

different personality profiles that either deviate greatly from societal norms or follow them to perfection.

What’s normal?

Much of our fascination with evil stems from the distinct impression that evildoers are anomalies. Their
actions are inhuman, unimaginable, rarely witnessed, and detrimental to our species’ survival. This
impression carries with it an assumption about what is expected or typical of our species, as well as what
is possible. It assumes that evildoers have thoughts, feelings, and desires that fall outside of the repertoire

of an average human being. Their actions are unimaginable because most human minds lack the capacity
