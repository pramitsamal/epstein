If there’s nothing surprising to you in the above list, I’m not surprised! If you’ve read a
bit in the modern cognitive science literature, the list may even seem trivial. But it’s worth
reflecting that 50 years ago, no such list could have been produced with the same level of broad
acceptance. And less than 100 years ago, the Western world’s scientific understanding of the
mind was dominated by Freudian thinking; and not too long after that, by behaviorist thinking,
which argued that theorizing about what went on inside the mind made no sense, and science
should focus entirely on analyzing external behavior. The progress of cognitive science hasn't
made as many headlines as contemporaneous progress in neuroscience or computing hardware
and software, but it’s certainly been dramatic. One of the reasons that AGI is more achievable
now than in the 1950s and 60s when the AI field began, is that now we understand the structures
and processes characterizing human thinking a lot better.

In spite of all the theoretical and empirical progress in the cognitive science field, however,
there is still no consensus among experts on how the various aspects of intelligence in the above
“human intelligence feature list” are achieved and interrelated. In these pages, however, for
the purpose of motivating CogPrime, we assume a broad integrative understanding roughly as
follows:

e Perception: There is significant evidence that human visual perception occurs using a
spatiotemporal hierarchy of pattern recognition modules, in which higher-level modules
