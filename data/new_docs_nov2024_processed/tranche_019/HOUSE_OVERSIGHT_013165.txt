13.3 Atoms: Their Types and Weights 249

Note that SubsetLink refers to a purely extensional subset relationship, and that Inheri-
tanceLInk should be used for the generic intensional + extensional analogue of this — more
on this below. SubsetLink could more consistently (with other link types) be named Extension-
alInheritanceLink, but SubsetLink is used because it’s shorter and more intuitive.

There are links representing Boolean operations AND, OR and NOT. For instance, we may
say
ImplicationLink

ANDLink
ConceptNode young

ConceptNode beautiful
ConceptNode attractive

or, using links and VariableNodes instead of ConceptNodes,

AverageLink $X
ImplicationLink
ANDLink
EvaluationLink young $X
EvaluationLink beautiful $x
EvaluationLink attractive $X

NOTLink is a unary link, so e.g. we might say

AverageLink $X
ImplicationLink
ANDLink
EvaluationLink young $X
EvaluationLink beautiful $x
EvaluationLink
NOT
EvaluationLink poor $X
EvaluationLink attractive $X

ContextLink allows explicit contextualization of knowledge, which is used in PLN, e.g.

ContextLink
ConceptNode golf
InheritanceLink
ObjectNode BenGoertzel
ConceptNode incompetent

says that Ben Goertzel is incompetent in the context of golf.

13.3.2 Variable Atoms

We have already introduced VariableNodes above; it’s also possible to specify the type of a
VariableNode via linking it to a VariableTypeNode via a TypedVariableLink, e.g.
VariableTypeLink

VariableNode $X

VariableTypeNode ConceptNode
which specifies that the variable $X should be filled with a ConceptNode.

Variables are handled via quantifiers; the default quantifier being the AverageLink, so that
the default interpretation of
