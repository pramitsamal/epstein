254 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation

The asymmetric HebbianLink indicates that when the first argument is present in a situation,
the second is also often present. The symmetric (default) version indicates that this relationship
holds in both directions. The inverse versions indicate the negative relationship: e.g. when one
argument is present in a situation, the other argument is often not present.

13.3.6 Procedure Nodes

There are nodes representing various sorts of procedures; these are kinds of ProcedureNode,
e.g.

e SchemaNode, indicating any procedure

e GroundedSchemaNode, indicating any procedure associated in the system with a Combo
program or C++ function allowing the procedure to be executed

e PredicateNode, indicating any predicate that associates a list of arguments with an output
truth value

e GroundedPredicateNode, indicating a predicate associated in the system with a Combo
program or C++ function allowing the predicate’s truth value to be evaluated on a given
specific list of arguments

ExecutionLinks and EvaluationLinks record the activity of SchemaNodes and PredicateN-
odes. We have seen many examples of EvaluationLinks in the above. Example ExecutionLinks
would be:

ExecutionLink step\_forward
ExecutionLink step\_forward 5
ExecutilonLink
+
ListLink
NumberNode: 2
NumberNode: 3

The first example indicates that the schema step forward has been executed. The second
example indicates that it has been executed with an argument of 5 (meaning, perhaps, that 5
steps forward have been attempted). The last example indicates that the ++ schema has been
executed on the argument list (2,3), presumably resulting in an output of 5.
The output of a schema execution may be indicated using an ExecutionOutputLink, e.g.

ExecutilonOutput Link

+

ListLink

NumberNode: 2
NumberNode: 3

refers to the value 5 (as a NumberNode).

13.3.7 Links for Special External Data Types

Finally, there are also Atom types referring to specific types of data important to using OpenCog
in specific contexts.
