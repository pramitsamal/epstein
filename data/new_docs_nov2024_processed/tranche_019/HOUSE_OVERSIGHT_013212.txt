Table 16.4: Prototypical preschool intelligence assessment tasks, Part 1

This testing protocol abstracts away from the particularities of any one teacher or student,
and focuses on effectiveness of communication in a human context rather than according to
formalized criteria. This is very much in the spirit of how assessment takes place in human
preschools (with the exception of the copying aspect): formal exams are rarely given in preschool,
but pragmatic, socially-embedded assessments are regularly made.

By including the copying aspect, more rigorous statistical assessments can be made regarding
efficacy of different approaches for a given AGI design, independent of past teaching experiences.
The multiple copies may, depending on the AGI system design, then be able to be reintegrated,
and further “learning” be done by higher-order cognitive systems in the AGI that integrate the
disparate experiences of the multiple copies.

This kind of parallel learning is different from both sequential learning that humans do, and
parallel presences of a single copy of an AGI (such as in multiple chat rooms type experiments).
All three approaches are worthy of study, to determine under what circumstances, and with
which AGI designs, one is more successful than another.

It is also worth observing how this test could be tweaked to yield a test of generalization
ability. After passing the above, the AGI could then be given a description of a new task
