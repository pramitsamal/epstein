The Art of Letting Bad Things Happen

[AFTER 3 WEEKS OFF OF THE BLOG]

Loong time no see! I just landed back in California from a long overdue mini-retirement through

London, Scotland, Sardinia, the Slovak Republic, Austria, Amsterdam, and Japan. Some unpleasant
surprises awaited me when I checked in on the evil e-mail inbox. Why? I let them happen.

I always do.

Here are just a few of the goodies that awaited me this time:

e » One of our fulfillment companies had been shut down due to the
CEO’s death, causing a 20%+ loss in monthly orders and
requiring an emergency shift of all web design and order
processing

e» Missed radio and magazine appearances and upset would-be
interviewers

e » More than a dozen lost joint-venture partnership opportunities

It’s not that I go out of my way to irritate people—not at all—but I recognize one critical fact:
Oftentimes, in order to do the big things, you have to let the small bad things happen. This is a skill we
want to cultivate.

What did I get in exchange for temporarily putting on blinders and taking a few glancing blows?

e » I followed the Rugby World Cup in Europe and watched the New
Zealand All Blacks live, a dream I’ve had for the last five years.
