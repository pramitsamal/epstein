Chart 47: Based on your post-election outlook for 2017, how do you
think WFC will perform against this 2 year target?

WFC sees modestly better benefit from steepening yield curve vs parallel shift.
Following the election, the 10yr yield is up 37bp while futures currently imply a 94%
probability the Fed raises rates in Dec. As such, Treasurer Neal Blinde noted that
WFC could realize a modestly better benefit to spread income from a steepening
yield curve vs. the current +$150mn/qtr expectation from a 25bp parallel shift. He
outlined how the bank’s actions to manage an interest rate cycle via balance sheet
positioning protect on the downside (i.e. post-Brexit) while at the same time allow
for an uptick when rates rise. WFC received numerous investor questions on when
they would deploy its dry power ($572bn in liquidity), and management noted that
the rate backdrop — not question marks on deposit duration — mostly drove
deployment decisions.

WFC reiterated its performance targets disclosed at its Investor Day. WFC
reiterated its 2-yr performance targets: (1) 1.1-1.4% ROA; (2) 11-14% ROE; (3) 55-
59% efficiency ratio; and (4) 55-75% net capital payout. As of 3Q16, the bank is
currently within these ranges on all metrics except for efficiency (3Q: 59.4%). This
is consistent with the 61% of the audience polled that expect WFC to perform
within the targeted ROE range as headwinds from Retail Banking is offset by an
improvement in the macro-economy. That said, 50% of the audience polled believe
the issues arising from the retail sales issue will modestly impact earnings (0-5%).
