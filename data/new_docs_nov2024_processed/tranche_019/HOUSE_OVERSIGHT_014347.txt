= WFC continues to make progress on regulatory compliance. As of 3Q, WFC’s
current total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) shortfall was 2.1% of risk weighted
assets or $29bn ($43bn including its internal buffer), an S8bn QoQ improvement.
That said, Mr Blinde assured investors that WFC will continue to focus on deposit
growth (66% of total funding) even as its long-term debt needs continue. WFC is
compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).

= Potential changes to annual stress test process viewed as positive. Mr. Blinde
noted that potential changes to the annual stress test process, as proposed by Gov.
Tarullo in Sept., is a “real” positive, specifically as it reduces any variance between
how the stressed risk weighted asset balance is calculated. This is likely positive for
the majority of investors polled (31%) who think capital return is the biggest
catalyst for the stock and the (70%) who see the dividend payout growing towards
the 40-50% range long-term (currently 37%).
