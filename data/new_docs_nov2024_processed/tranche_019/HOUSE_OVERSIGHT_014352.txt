e EV disclosed their FAQ AUM which was $336.4B up modestly from $334.4B at the
end of its prior quarter as modest market losses were offset by inflows which were
also disclosed by EV. Flows for C3Q (F4Q) were $4.8B/6% aog or $1.7B/3% aog ex
exposure management flows, roughly in-line with expectations in a fairly
challenging backdrop. EV also commented on their recent acquisition of Calvert
Investments (~$12B AUM, see note) and is excited about the opportunity in ESG
investing. Calvert is a leader in investing in socially responsible companies, a small
but rapidly growing area.

e | When asked about the outlook on fixed income performance and flows given the
recent run up in rates as well as the outlook, EV was fairly positive in their outlook
given their positioning and leadership in floating rate which should perform well
and attract flows in a rising rate environment.

¢ _ETMFs continue to be topical for EV given they are the only player in the non-
transparent active ETF business with their NextShares franchise. EV has launched 3
NextShares thus far and Waddell and Reed launched 3 of their own in October,
making 6 total NextShares in the market right now, however they are only available
through Folio and Interactive Brokers. While we continue to view this as not very
significant in the near term and a potential longer term opportunity, with EV signing
on UBS and Envestnet for distribution in 2017, we should see a little more traction
ahead.

« Regarding potential changes from the election, while very early, management thinks
that whatever happens to the DOL Fiduciary Rule (delay, modify, etc.), the industry
has already been shifting in a fiduciary direction, and they expect that to continue,
though the pace could vary depending on the eventual outcome. Additionally, EV has
limited exposure to higher distribution share classes (<20% of sales), so they see a
more limited impact. In terms of a lower corporate tax rate (15-20%), this would
have a meaningful benefit for EV, potentially increasing earnings by 15-20%.
