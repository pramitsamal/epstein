Presenting from LM was Joe Sullivan, Chairman & CEO, and Alan Magleby, Head of
IR. Joe was optimistic on the flow outlook for LM given the repositioning over the
past few years, mostly favorable investment performance, and a healthy
institutional pipeline, and does not expect a significant change in the DOL impact
because of the election or a lower corporate tax rate on their cash tax rate.

overwhelmingly (82%) replied “strong organic growth, particularly in

margins/operating leverage (6%) were less interesting for investors. Nobody said
that a stronger balance sheet or more affiliate deals would get them more excited
about LM’s stock.
