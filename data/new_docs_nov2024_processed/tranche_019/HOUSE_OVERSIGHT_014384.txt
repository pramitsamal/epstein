high growth peers. We place a 16x multiple on our 2017E EPS in line with SMID peers.
Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 3%.

Downside risks to our price objective are worse than expected decrease in oil prices,
regulatory issues, deteriorating credit quality, and if M&A synergies do not materialize.
Upside risks are sooner than expected recovery in the oil price, faster than expected rate
hikes or better than expected improvement in the US economy.

Invesco (IVZ)

Our $36 price objective is based on a target P/E multiple of 14x our 2017E, which is
above |VZ's historical valuation relative to the group given expectations for superior
organic growth. Risks to our price objective are market depreciation and investment
underperformance, as for all asset managers, along with volatile flows in IVZ's passive
strategies, non-US currency and market risk.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF} to arrive at our $83 PO,
assigning a 1.5x multiple to 2017E TBV and 13x multiple on 2017E EPS. We have
weighted the P/E and P/TBV factors equally at 40%, and our DCF analysis by 20%.

Near term, we view JPM's current market P/E multiple as overly discounted, but expect
money center banks will likely continue to trade at a discount to the regionals. Our 11x
multiple is a 2x discount to our median multiple as we believe in the near future, money
centers will continue to trade at a discount to regional peers. Our DCF assumes a two-
stage cost of capital of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 4%.

Risks to our price objective are macro risks such as a longer than expected low interest
rate environment and further regulation and scrutiny of the financials industry. Specific
to JPM, risks are enhanced regulatory and capital standards as a Global SIFI, mortgage
putback risk, material decline in investment banking/trading profitability, and increased
litigation on matters such as private label securitization, foreclosures, etc.

Key Corp (KEY)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our $18 PO
and assign a 1.4x multiple to 2017E TBV and 15x multiple on 2017E EPS, in-line with its
peer group due to near median profitability and EPS growth. Our DCF assumes a two
stage cost of capital of 13.4% and 10.9% and a terminal growth rate of 5% and Tier 1
common of 8% at termination.

Downside risks to our PO are a prolonged low interest rate environment, greater than
expected expenses, inability to maximize balance sheet efficiency, and the
announcement of expensive deals.

KKR & Co. (KKR)

Our price objective (PO) for KKR is $17, which results in a target price-to-ENI (P/ENI or
P/E) multiple of 10x our 2017 economic net income (ENI) estimate. Our price objective
is based on our sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) analysis. Our SOTP analysis is based on the
following components: a target multiple on fee related earnings (11x - discount to asset
manager multiples given revenue mix), a discount to book value for the balance sheet
investments and accrued carry given markets, and a discounted value on the
performance fee upside over a cycle. Based on this method, we value the fee related
earnings at $6/unit, the balance sheet (principal investments and accrued carry) at
$9/unit, and the discounted value of future carry income and investment income at
$2/unit, which equates to a total value of $17, in line with our price objective.

Risks to our PO: a weak macro and capital markets backdrop, potential changes in tax
laws related to carried interest and partnerships, regulatory and political risk, poor
