X Asset Strategy: Long growth, short bonds, long USD but
the hunt for yield lives on

Clearly markets are different and will continue to be so under President elect Trump
BUT not everything will change. The disinflationary forces triggered by the GFC have
not gone away but the decision to focus on fiscal stimulus, not just in the US but also
Japan and to a lesser extent the UK, is a welcome shift taking some of the burden away
from monetary policy. It means rates should be higher for any given amount of growth.
But higher does not mean a return to pre GFC levels of rates, which we need to bear in
mind when setting our strategy. Indeed, our strategists 10Y forecasts are US 2.65%,
Euro 0.65% and Japan 0% for end 2017.

Similarly on trade, for all the rhetoric of the President-elect again we do not think he
wants to trigger trade wars that would damage US growth. That means we should not
necessarily drop our pro-EM bias.

So we think of it as an evolution rather than a revolution in the way our strategy is
structured. We wanted to be exposed to growth, we tweak that by adding a NKY long to
replace our US energy long. We continue to have yield in the portfolio where we can find
it, which is through a mixture of equities and credit (AT1’s, European yield basket, Xover
v Main and US long date industrial spreads).

Even more than before we want to be protected against a stronger USD and higher
rates, hence the addition of the 10Y real yield trade, and trade tensions which we have
tried to cover through our CNH put.

Nov 8 accelerates some trends, starts other

Before the US election we said that the tectonic plates were starting to shift, with bond
yields having troughed and starting to head higher. We thought there were signs too
that global growth might be shifting up a gear. So we wanted to have defensive
positions in bond markets, be long the USD and be long growth where we could. The
election of Donald Trump has arguably turned this gradual shifting of plates into a full
blown earthquake for global financial markets.

The key questions for investors as we look ahead to 2017 are how big an earthquake
and how much the moves that have happened since November 8 are likely to be
extended into next year vs how much we have frontloaded them already in 2016.
