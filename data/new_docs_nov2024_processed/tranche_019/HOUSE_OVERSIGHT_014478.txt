What then is the prospect for inflation expectations from here? Breakevens have moved
significantly already in the context of the Euro area inflation outlook. 5-year, 5-year
forward inflation swaps have recovered all the ground they lost earlier in 2016 in Europe
and are back to end 2014 levels in the US. At 1.6% in Europe and 2.44% in US there is
arguably more limited upside. A return to the range for inflation expectations that
prevailed in 2013/14 before the oil price collapse would imply another 30-50bp from
here. However, at least in the case of Europe our economists see the outlook for
inflation remaining very subdued. Overall we would conclude that equities can see
upside from here if bond yields rise towards our fixed income team’s targets as long as
inflation expectations are stable to rising at the same time.

Rising bond yields pushing Italian spreads wider a risk for equities. Although rising
core rates are not necessarily problematic for stocks, an important caveat is the fall out
in other parts of the bond markets — particularly in the periphery. The equity market in
Europe is sensitive to rising Italian bond spreads — exhibiting a negative correlation in
recent years. This is an important risk at the current juncture given the upcoming
referendum in Italy and ECB decision on QE extension. Should Italian bond spreads
widen significantly from here it would likely weigh on equity valuations, keeping the risk
premium high in Europe and in turn offset or outweigh the benefit from rising nominal
growth expectations globally. This is perhaps the biggest potential problem for equities
in the scenario that bond yields rise further from here. The ECB decision on QE
extension is an important risk event in that context. As our economists have discussed
in a recent note the risks of an ECB delay in the short term are increasing but their base
case remains a QE extension with some tweaks of the capital key — a relatively benign
outcome for peripheral sovereigns.
