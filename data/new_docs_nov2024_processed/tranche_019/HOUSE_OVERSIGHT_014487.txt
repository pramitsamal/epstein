Building inflationary pressures point to post-Christmas consumer squeeze

The third act in waiting for Brexit is cost-push inflation from the fall in GBP. So far,
consumer spending has held up far better than most expected, especially retail spending
by the over 50s. But there is evidence the inflationary canary is starting to sing. The
charts below show that the move in CPI has lagged sharp rises in manufacturing output
prices, utility prices and food prices in the past two months.

To understand this delay it is worth remembering “Marmitegate” and the pressure put
on companies not to raise the prices of household brands. The incident also illustrates
the margin pressure building up in the system and challenges posed to producers,
vendors and consumers as to who will absorb the higher costs. According to the
Chairman of the UK Food and Drink Federation many companies may be waiting until
post-Christmas to change prices, which lan Wright estimates could rise as much as 8%.
If that happens at the same time as power prices hit seasonal highs, the consumer could
Start to feel the pinch.

To avoid this leading to a contraction in demand, workers we would need to see strong
nominal wage growth. However, the Institute of Fiscal Studies does not expect real
wages to return to 2008 levels until 2021. The tightness of the UK labour market could
also cushion any blow, but we note jobless claims have started to rise again and
businesses may be less likely to hire if uncertainty, for reasons outlined above, picks up
again.
