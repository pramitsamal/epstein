Overweight Healthcare

Healthcare looks very attractively valued and we see compelling risk reward in the sector
on an outright basis at current levels. The fundamental bull case for Health rests on the
strong pipeline of new products for the big cap pharma universe. Our sector analysts
forecast EU Pharma to deliver a 2018-21E EPS CAGR of 11%, up from mid-single digit
levels in recent years. Historically that would justify a PE re-rating and a multiple for the
pharma sub-sector nearer 17-18x than the current 13x 2018 PE.

We believe the Republican clean sweep in the US elections represents a positive
catalyst as it significantly decreases the potential for legislative initiatives to
aggressively control drug pricing in the US. The catalyst for the sector to re-rate will
come progressively from newsflow around new products. The next 12 months should
see progress on this front with several of the European large caps expected to announce
key data on important drugs in 2017.

Healthcare’s forward PE is now down to just a 7% premium relative to the market and
nearing the valuation lows recorded in 2010-12 when the patent cliff was at its worst
and pipelines were very weak. Today pipelines are twice the size they were in 2011 and
innovation is the key to growth in the sector - pricing power remains strong in drug
categories with differentiated products. The new product launches expected between
2015 and 2018 add up to potential sales of $133 billion.
