First came Brexit, then Donald Trump’s election as the president of the most powerful
country in the world. The world has changed. Possibly irrevocably so.

These ground shifts have been brought on by a backlash to globalization, increasingly
viewed as the culprit for wage stagnation (Chart 1), growing disparity of income and
wealth between the rich and the poor (Chart 2), and the loss of national identity. We
suspect the trend of anti-globalization is here to stay.

Wide-ranging consequences for financial markets
In our view, the anti-globalization theme will have at least seven major consequences
for financial markets in 2017.

1. Monetary easing will give way to fiscal easing

The history of populism is one of fiscal largesse. Furthermore, with limited scope for
further monetary easing, fiscal easing is becoming the last and only resort for
policymakers. It seems reasonable to assume that the combination of these two factors
will soon usher in a period of easier fiscal policy.

Nowhere will the impact of fiscal easing be felt more than the US in 2017, in our view.
The GOP has achieved a rare clean sweep in the latest elections. During the 18 years
that a single party controlled both the Presidency and Congress since 1965, US
structural budget balance as a share of potential GDP deteriorated by O.4pp a year on
average (Chart 3). In other words, history tells us that a clean sweep is usually a recipe
for fiscal stimulus. The GOP has the additional incentive to use fiscal easing to boost
economic growth ahead of the mid-term elections in 2018. The Republicans will need to
pick up at least eight more seats in the Senate to accomplish their stated objectives of
repealing Obamacare and Dodd-Frank (Chart 4). We think the Republican controlled
Congress will use the reconciliation process (which has a deadline of 15 April} to pass
most of its fiscal agenda into law.

2. Fiscal easing not yet priced into the belly of the curve

Fiscal easing is unlikely to be kind to the Treasury market. For one thing, a bigger
budget deficit would increase risk premium. And, fiscal easing at this late stage of the
expansion would likely lead investors to demand higher inflation risk premium. Also,
