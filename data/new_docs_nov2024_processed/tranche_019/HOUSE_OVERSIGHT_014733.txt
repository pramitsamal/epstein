fiscal easing will likely place pressure on the Fed to normalize rates more quickly when
internal dissent against near zero rates is growing.

US rates have backed up quickly after the election, driven largely by a repricing of
inflation expectations. With long-term inflation breakevens closing on their historical
averages (Chart 5), we think the next phase of the rates move will be led by the belly of
the curve. The market is only pricing in a one and a quarter rate hike in 2017, and
another one and a quarter hike in 2018, with Fed Funds futures implying that the Fed
Funds rates will be only at 1.25% at the end of 2018 (Chart 6). We think the 5y part of
the curve offers the best risk-reward trade-off for investors with a 3-6 month horizon to
position for a more aggressive Fed. As our leading indicator section suggests, global
growth momentum is set to pick up in Q1, also supporting this view.

For investors with a 1-3 month horizon, we would recommend shorting 10y real rates.
This trade would benefit from higher rates in general, but more importantly, would also
benefit from a sudden risk-off that could render vulnerable reflation trades that have
gone a very long way since 9 November. This trade would also benefit from a grand
bargaining that stabilizes long-term debt dynamics, cuts waste and supports investment
and growth.

markets, yield differentials are likely to move in favor of the USD. This will be especially
