We continue to believe in the reflation theme because:

1. Strength in the global economy is genuine - European PMIs are at 6 year highs, Chinese and
Japanese PMIs continue to improve too. In fact ~90% of PMIs globally are above 50 and 60% have
increased in the last 3 months.

2. Earnings revisions and Global Wave point to continued upturn - earnings revisions now
above 1.0 for the first time since 2011.
Be We expect Trump to deliver on tax, even if it is smaller than hoped for - should such a

package be put together it would likely support the Trump trade once again after the failure to reform
Obamacare

4. Bond markets are being too sanguine about the likely pace of Fed tightening - the Fed
funds curve is once again well below the dot plot. We continue to see upside in yields if and when the
market becomes more convinced that the soft data is right.

European Banks have quickly reversed the performance gap to US peers. The spread between the SX7E
and S5BANKX Index is back to pre-US election levels.

What the EU banks bulls are saying:
EUR rates are going higher it’s just a matter of timing, positive EPS revisions continue, EU is starting to
see pockets of volume growth and asset yield recovery, credit spreads have been tightening YTD and
