° ISP will pay a dividend (confirmed) equivalent to an 8.0% yield vs. a 4.0% European banks
average and on our estimates

° Italian banks are trading at a PNAV discount to ISP but their profitability is half that of ISP's and
their capital is lower

° ISP retains the lowest (gross/net) Italian NPE ratio and in 4Q16 NPE were down yoy by 8%
gross/10% net.

e Shares have suffered from the uncertainty related to a possible tie-up with insurer Generali - still

the seventh worst performing bank in the SX7E YTD

Also remain very bullish on market exposed Nordic banks

This morning we reiterate our preference for Nordic ee wan here for report) with more market

exposed revenues and reiterate our Buy ratings on Danske Bank, Nordea, DNB and SEB ahead of Qi
results. We expect to see good fee /trading income in Q1 on the back of strong AUM and continued high
activity levels.

The relative P/E premium of Nordic banks vs. the sector is now 7% vs. a long term average of 11%. We
also note that Nordic banks are expected to continue to deliver close to 4% better ROTE (2017-19E) and
have a lower beta.
