Souq.com brings Amazon into the Middle East

Amazon announced that it has an agreement to acquire Souq.com, the leading
eCommerce platform in the Middle East. Terms were not disclosed, though press
reports indicate that Amazon had bid $650mn for the company before Emaar Malls
made a public bid of S800mn. This will represent Amazon’s largest deal since the
$970mn Twitch acquisition in 2014.

Sougq.com does not disclose its sales or earnings, making it difficult to assess the
acquisition multiple or potential accretion of the deal. An S800mn acquisition implies
0.2% of Amazon’s current market cap. Though it is somewhat surprising for Amazon to
acquire a company in order to enter a new market, Amazon can leverage logistics,
sourcing, customer, and technology investments at Souq.com. The deal is expected to
close in 2017. Souq.com offers 8.4mn products across 31 categories, including
electronics, health & beauty, fashion, home goods, and baby. The site has 45mn monthly
visitors and localized operations in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Egypt and localized sites for
the UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar. Euromonitor estimates
that Middle East & Africa GMV is $9bn market in 2016 though other reports peg the
market at $20bn, implying roughly 1-2% eCommerce penetration in the region vs. mid-
teens in Western markets. Press reports last year indicated that Amazon was exploring
entering Australia and Singapore in 2017. The Souq.com acquisition may signal a more
aggressive global expansion plan.

Estimates vs. Consensus: Above Street revenue and EPS

We expect 1Q revenue/EPS of $35.3bn/$2.34 vs. Street at $35.3bn/$2.28. Amazon’s 1Q
revenue guidance is $33.25-35.75 and GAAP operating income of $250-900 (we are at
$898mn in operating income}. Our 1Q revenue estimate of $35.3bn (+21% y/y vs. 22%
in 4Q16)} is based on 24% y/y unit growth vs. 24% y/y in 4Q. For 1Q17, we estimate
-19% q/q revenue growth vs -19% q/q in 1Q last year. We are below the street for 2Q
margins.
