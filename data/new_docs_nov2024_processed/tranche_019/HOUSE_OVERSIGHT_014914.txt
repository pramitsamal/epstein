Netflix (Buy, $154 PO)

Stock view: Easy comps ahead with more content on the way

Heading into 1Q earnings, we expect Netflix to beat subscriber estimates given strong
recent content launches, and accelerating subscriber growth in Europe. Key 1Q titles
included A Series of Unfortunate Events, 13 Reasons Why, and Marvel’s /ron Fist. We
see few competitive issues this quarter to impact subscriber growth and we think the
release of Marvel’s lron Fist likely helped quarter ending subscribers, despite low
metacritic scores. Fans of the Defender series still seem to be watching the show with
Parrot Analytics indicating viewership was just below Luke Cage its first week (though
viewership dropped by half within the first 10 days). In addition, fan ratings came in at
81% on Rotten Tomatoes despite the poor critic reception.

For 2Q, we expect a solid guide as Netflix laps 2Q16’s price increases internationally
and in the U.S. This should help churn rates for 2Q especially in Europe where we think
the bulk of Netflix subscriber growth will originate for 2017. In addition, Netflix has a
stronger slate of titles vs. 1Q including key franchises like House of Cards, Orange is the
New Black, Sense&, and other new series. Although competition is increasing in the
SVOD space with Amazon, Hulu and other making original content, we still see Netflix as
ahead of the competition due to: 1) sheer volume of content production with over 1000
hours in 2016, with strong local market content that can be leveraged globally, 2)
competitive price points vs competitors; and 3} the largest volume of 4K content which
attracts new TV purchases. 4K TVs could drive upside to estimates in FY17 as Netflix is
one of the few services with a library of 4K content.

For 1Q contribution margins, we estimate that Netflix will reach a new high at 41.3%
U.S. contribution margins somewhat offset by international contribution margins which
we expect to close to zero at 1.5%, but still a large improvement over 4Q’s 8% loss. We
expect Netflix to run its International division at new break even margins through FY17
and begin to gradually lift international margins in 2018. As Netflix reaches Intl
profitability, the investor story may focus more on EPS growth in the coming years.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Net sub adds internationally and 2Q guide

For 1Q we see two critical metrics that we think the Street will focus on; 1) Net Intl.
subscriber additions as Netflix laps the launch in 130 countries globally; and 2} 2Q net
subscriber guide for Netflix in the U.S. Although 1Q domestic subscriber ads are
important, we think the Street would be willing to look past a lower domestic number on
stronger international growth. In 2Q Netflix could potentially hit a flat subscriber
growth quarter as 2Q is typically seasonally weak, though we note the content slate for
2Q16 has several top franchises with new seasons.
