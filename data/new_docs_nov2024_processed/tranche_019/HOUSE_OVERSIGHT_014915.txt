¢ Content spending impact on FCF

Top 1Q data points: Traffic gains on PC

In the U.S., comScore reported quarter to date (Jan. and Feb.) average unique desktop
visitors up down 2% y/y to 40.5 million compared to 4Q up 22% y/y or 47 million, while
mobile unique users were flat y/y at 29.4mn users vs. up 19% y/y in 4Q. We note recent
comScore changes heavily impacted the y/y comparable data for several companies
including Netflix, in addition Comscore Data is PC only which is likely less relevant given
that a large portion of Netflix viewing is through connected TVs/devices.

Estimates vs. Consensus: In-line on revenue, slightly below on EPS

Our 1Q rev/GAAP EPS estimates of $2.71bn/$0.39 are above the Street’s estimates of
$2.64bn/S0.37. We estimate total domestic subs of 51.1 million, domestic DVD subs of
4 million, and international streaming subs of 48.3 million. Netflix a solid line up of
popular content in 2Q, especially May where it has Sense& Season 2, Unbreakable
Kimmy Schmidt Season 3, War Machine (Movie), House of Cards Season 5 in May, and a
remake of Anne of Green Gables and Orange is the New Black in June which will likely
help U.S. domestic subscriber total stay positive in 2Q. In addition, we expect lower y/y
churn rates to potentially help subscriber growth.
