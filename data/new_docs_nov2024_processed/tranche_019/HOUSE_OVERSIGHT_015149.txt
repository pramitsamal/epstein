Blitzer from CNN asked Clinton at a press conference what he would like
to say to me, Clinton smiled and said, “That’ s good, that’ s
good” —referring sarcastically to the question—but it was extremely
ironic, because that’ s exact/y what | imagined he did say to me: “That' s
good, that’ s good.” And | replied, “Il gave you a blow job, but! didn’ t
swallow.” He started laughing hysterically, just like that time he did with
Boris Yeltsin. Bill liked my sense of humor. That’ s why we went from
flirtation to friendship.

However, the reasons | visited the White House thirty-seven times
was not for Bill—it was to be with Hillary—she was the one who desired
me physically. The rumor about her being a lesbian was true. And so my
relationship with Bill was complicated. He just acted as a middle man for
Hillary, and now, by denying an affair with me he’ s telling the truth and
taking the fall for Aer In that sense, he’ s an incredibly loyal husband.
Despite what the public may think, Bill is absolutely devoted to Hillary.

Everybody is watching so closely for him to commit the next
indiscretion, but it would have to be with somebody he can fota//y trust,
somebody who could suck the leader of the Western World’ s dick and
not confide in a friend, or to somebody who pretended to be a friend. So,

for a while, Bill is left with only Buddy’ s tongue for sexual companionship.
