“It'’ s charming,” I reply, “but what are you gonna do if the metal
detector goes off at the airport?”

| leave them giggling in the elevator as | get off on a floor where
I' ve heard there would be lots of action. | follow one group, but only the
couple in front really knows where they’ re going. But they happen to be
on the way to their own room, and when they get there, they go in, close
the door, and we are all left out in the corridor, looking like a perplexed
ant farm. Everybody turns around. | am now at the front of the line, so | let
them all pass by me as they head in the opposite direction, strolling
briskly, except for the one-legged man with the roller skate and crutches,
who is gliding gracefully along the carpet. Passersby are asked, in vain,

“Where’ s the party?” We finally find a room with a porn photo on the
door, which is slightly open.

Inside, there are around fifty people in semi-darkness. Exhibitionists
and voyeurs, together again. Here a blow job, there a copulation,
everywhere an undulating juiciness. There is an unspoken
homophobia—no man is relating sexually to another man—but there is
lots of lesbian libido. In order to keep a low profile, | have ripped several
pages out of my notebook and folded them in half, so that | can take

notes unobtrusively.
