caution on his part because | promised if he fucked around with me, |’ d
let on that he caught his herpes from Nancy Reagan.”

Digby Diehl concluded, “Harlan’ s only fear is that he’ Il get in a
car accident and have to re-live this event. And in the true tradition of
roasting, that tradition being to talk dirty and mention a big name, thank
you all for coming. And join us next week when our guest roaster will be
Mother Teresa.”

| blurted out, “I fucked her.”

The audience screamed, hooted, stomped, and Robin jumped out of
his chair and ran around in a circle. Then he said, “Gandhi is going,

‘Who is this man? He may not get through the gates of heaven for that
line’ ”

Harlan said, “Thank God Krassner got off one good one.”

| explained, “I guess | just fell into the insult mode.”

“Basically,” said Robert Silverberg, “the roast is a really ugly,
repugnant, immature and childish art form. | hate it. And | will only do one
if Harlan is the target.”

And on our way home, Nancy summed up the irony: “A
compliment was originally perceived as an insult, and consequently we’ ve

had an evening of insults which were really compliments.”
