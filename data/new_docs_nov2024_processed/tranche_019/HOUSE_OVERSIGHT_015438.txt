hours with virtually no sleep to finish on time. We received a rare
commendation and bonus from NASA for superior performance ahead of

schedule and below budget.”

Gordon Cooper--one of those seven original astronauts—had
piloted the longest and final Mercury space flight in 1963, becoming the
first American to sleep in orbit. “He gave me a rare souvenir,” George
reminds me, “a dehydrated oatmeal cookie the size of a large dice that he
had on a space mission. During a family dinner, | passed around the cookie
for everyone to see. Dad was hard of hearing and didn’ t hear the story,
so he popped the space cookie into his mouth, and it was gone before |
could get any words out of my mouth. It was pure grief when it happened,

but funny now.”

As | write this in 2014, George is 85, and if a movie were to be made
about him, he’ d like to be portrayed by Matt Damon. In October 1988, he
was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer and given three years to
live, but his daughter Devra, a naturopath, convinced him to meet with a
macrobiotic counselor, and overnight he changed his diet and

lifestyle. Now it’ s twenty-six years later.
