He played tennis until six months ago, when he discontinued after a
bad fall, because he was playing too aggressively. Currently, his exercise
consists of taking walks and lifting dumbbells, though not simultaneously.
He remains active, doing business seminars for adult education, providing
legal plans for families, small businesses and employees, and calling square

dances. But not for helicopters. Or drones.
