brain. The impulses split and form two distinct paths, one through the
cerebral cortex, which gives us the sensation of conscious vision, and the
other into the lower brain which provides us with instinctive reactions.

The right hand side of your body is connected to the left hemisphere
of the brain and vice versa. This means each hand is controlled by the
opposite side of the brain. But, your eyes see both your hands. To resolve
this conundrum a very complex thing has to happen to the optic nerve in
the center of the brain. The optic nerve from each eye splits and crosses
over in the middle, so the left side of the left eye and the left side of the
right eye goes to the right hand side of the brain and vice versa. This
keeps the brain focused on the correct hand.
