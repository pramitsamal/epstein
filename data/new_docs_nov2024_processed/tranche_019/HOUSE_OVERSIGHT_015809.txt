Synapse

has a similar structure. It is a flat protein laid down as a spiral on the
outside of nerve cells. The theory is that cell firing causes myelination,
which permanently imprints the memory.

The alternate class of theory proposes memory is encoded at a much
smaller scale. Neurons are quite complex structures in their own right.
Inside each neuron is a lattice of proteins, which forms a skeleton. Part
of that skeleton provides structural integrity to the neuron, while other
elements provide control and motility. It is this control part of the skeleton
that people believe might encodememory. A 2012 paper by Travis Craddock
and Jack Tuszynski of the University of Alberta, and anesthesiologist Stuart
Hameroff of the University of Arizona proposes a protein called CaMKII
binds to the cytoskeleton in 32 different configurations, providing a binary
data encoding. It is an elegant idea but it also relies on your believing their
model for quantum neuron processing which is still highly controversial.
If proven, they are my top Nobel Prize tip for this decade!

Photographic Memory

Until recently conventional wisdom held that true photographic memory
was a myth and the few people claiming to have it really used some sort
of mnemonic memory technique to selectively memorize things. The
