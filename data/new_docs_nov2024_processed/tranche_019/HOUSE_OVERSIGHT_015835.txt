But Cats Can!

As chance would have it, as I was writing this book about the impossibility
of creating great literary works at random, our new kitten, Jessie, sat
on my keyboard - she likes the warmth. To my great embarrassment
I have been proven wrong. Here is her first literary work. I managed to
capture her on camera a little later that evening, editing a spreadsheet.
My brain interprets this string as the cat thanking me for good food. I
wonder if you see the same thing? This is just a demonstration of the
strength of human pattern detection algorithms and not, sadly, of feline
communication.
