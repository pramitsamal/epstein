they implement it mechanically. You see, of course, the problem. It
will be riddled with bugs because they have missed the creative step of
imagining the whole problem and solving it in the round.

This fundamental misconception of software is common in many
organizations. “Ah,” says the finance director, “I'll write a very detailed
spec and then we can get someone cheap to just program it.” This does
not work. If the finance director has done the creative work of taking a
problem and turning it into a detailed specification for the programmer
to ‘just program’ — removing any ambiguity and therefore the creative
overhead - he will have all but written software himself, albeit in
a computer language of his own making. On the other hand, if the
specification is a linear list of issues with no creative thought, he will not
have reduced the time needed to program. He may have improved the
quality by effectively getting a second pair of eyes onto the requirements
gathering stage, but this does not help the programming effort itself.

Ideally, you should never split up specification and coding. It is a
creative process best handled by very small numbers of people working
intensively on it. Of course, there is one big problem with this: some
software tasks are huge. Before we look at the science of splitting up a
software project, it is worth pointing out that many of the most famous
projects were written by one man. I have met many of these people and
they are all exceptional - Linus Torvalds, Linux; Anthony Minessale,
FreeSWITCH; Daniel-Constantin Mierla, Kamailio; Eric Allman,
ssendMail. Before splitting a project between many people, it is worth
considering whether you can give it to just one individual. To do this you
