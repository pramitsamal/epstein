Communication Hypothesis} — That face to face communication

7-38-55 Rule — Mehrabian’s observation that the emotional
content of communication is 7% words, 38% tone of voice and
55% body language.

. The Brain

Penrose-Hameroff Conjecture — Brains are quantum-gravity
computers using tubulin as the mediator.

. Knowledge

Information Continuum Hypothesist — Information is finite,
but understanding and knowledge are different in nature.
Infinite Monkeys Hypothesis — The paradox that says monkeys
could type Hamlet given enough time and paper.

Cat Experimentt — Finding my house cat can use our computer,

species within an evolutionary niche to disprove the existence of
something; in this case polywater.

The Infinity of Primes — Pythagoras’ proof there are an infinity
of prime numbers without needing the concept of a number.

. Complexity & Chaos

The Butterfly Effect — The proposal by Edward Lorenz that tiny
effects can multiply up into enormous results.

P#NP — That non-deterministic polynomial problems can never
be solved in polynomial time and are, therefore, beyond the
capability of any imagined computer.

The Hawking-Bekenstein Turk} — Although there is a perfect
chess machine, it would collapse space-time to a black hole were
it to exist.

.

Continuum Hypothesis — Does anything come between the
first two infinities; counting numbers and the continuum of real
