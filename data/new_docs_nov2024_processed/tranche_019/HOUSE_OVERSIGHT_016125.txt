Human capital is critical and takes time to build

In our view, improvements to human capital, rather than business climate supply-side
reforms, are the critical barriers to overcome. While building the appropriately qualified
workforce takes time, Saudi Arabia has been making progress in this area. c25% of
Saudi tertiary graduates complete humanities and arts programs, but this is down from
39.4% in 1999. Graduates from social sciences, business and law represented the
largest share of graduates at 27.2% of total in 2014, up from 15.5% in 1999. Still, as we
discuss in later sections, diversification prospects are mixed across sectors and will
likely depend in part on providing the appropriate incentives to the private sector.

Mobilizing domestic resources is key

The NTP makes clear that part of the NTP costs (40%) will need to be shouldered by the
private sector. Out of a total estimated NTP cost of SAR447bn (USS119bn; 18.4% of
GDP), the NTP implies that the private sector will need to contribute about SAR179bn
over the coming five years (US$47.6bn; 7.4% of GDP). Implementation of growth-
boosting initiatives will require a challenging crowding in of private sector investment.
The NTP expects only a SAR40bn increase in the level of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI), meaning that the bulk of private sector investment could have to come from
domestic sources. While the government investment is generally in retrenchment mode,
the NTP may be suggesting that selective and strategic projects are likely to go ahead.
Authorities have also suggested a number of projects could be structured as Public-
Private Partnerships (PPP).
