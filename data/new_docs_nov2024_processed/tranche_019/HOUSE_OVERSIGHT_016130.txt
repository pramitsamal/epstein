Further energy subsidy reform is likely
The figures announced by the Deputy Crown Prince regarding proceeds of subsidy
reform suggests material changes over the next 3-4 years, with annual savings close to
the landmark first round of administered price changes in late 2015. However, his
suggestion that the changes could be accompanied by partially offsetting cash transfers
to poor households suggests policy-making caution. We do not think such a
redistributive system could be technically put in place in a short time span.
Recall that concurrently with the 2016 budget, a first round of energy subsidy reform
saw sweeping energy, water and electricity administered price changes being instituted
in late December. We estimated the natural gas price hike on petrochemical firms,
domestic crude oil price hike as well as the combined gasoline and diesel price hike
introduced could add US$2.2bn, US$2.0bn and USS$3.8bn to central government
revenues if fully passed to the budget (a combined 1.2% of GDP). Impact of continued
similar policies on domestic prices would be a further 1.5-2ppt annual increase in
headline inflation, and a gradual squeeze to household incomes (where gasoline, water
and electricity likely represented c.1.5%, c0.4% and 1.6% respectively of consumer
spending basket prior to the late December 2015 administered price adjustments).

Fiscal consolidation plan looks challenging to fully achieve
The US$100bn target in additional non-oil revenue through 2020 appears difficult to
reach and is likely to leave a sizeable financing gap based on the current proposals, in
