10/27/99 - OPINION - Barry Krischer; P.B.Co. State Attorney. (AM)

“Our investigation had discovered at least one of her websites and I am enclosing
some examples ... the site goes on to detail, including photos, her apparent
fascination with marijuana, ’’ Dershowitz wrote in an undated letter to Recarey.
He also disputed the claim that one of the defense team’s private investigators
had misrepresented himself as a police officer.

Recarey stood his ground.

“His attorneys showed us a MySpace page where one of the girls was holding a
beer in her hand, and they said, ‘oh look, she is underage drinking,’ ”’ Recarey
recalled. “Well, tell me what teenager doesn’t? Does that mean she isn’t a victim
because she drank a beer? Basically, what you're telling me is the only victim of a
sexual battery could be a nun.”

Krischer and the lead state prosecutor on the case, Assistant State Attorney Lanna
Belohlavek, began to dodge Recarey and Reiter’s phone calls and emails, and they
dragged their feet on approving subpoenas, Reiter and Recarey said.
