extreme, 1.5% of the population exhibited a dramatic rise
(s>5). This subpopulation is highly enriched for Nazis and
Nazi-supporters, who benefited immensely from government
propaganda (7).

These results provide a strategy for rapidly identifying
likely victims of censorship from a large pool of possibilities,
and highlights how culturomic methods might complement
existing historical approaches.

Culturomics

Culturomics is the application of high-throughput data
collection and analysis to the study of human culture. Books
are a beginning, but we must also incorporate newspapers
(29), manuscripts (30), maps (3/), artwork (32), and a myriad
of other human creations (33, 34). Of course, many voices —
already lost to time — lie forever beyond our reach.

Culturomic results are a new type of evidence in the
humanities. As with fossils of ancient creatures, the challenge
of culturomics lies in the interpretation of this evidence.
Considerations of space restrict us to the briefest of surveys: a
handful of trajectories and our initial interpretations. Many
more fossils, with shapes no less intriguing, beckon:

(i) Peaks in “influenza” correspond with dates of known
pandemics, suggesting the value of culturomic methods for
historical epidemiology (35) (Fig. 5A).

(ii) Trajectories for “the North”, “the South”, and finally,
“the enemy” reflect how polarization of the states preceded
the descent ito war (Fig. 5B).

(ii) In the battle of the sexes, the “women” are gaining
ground on the “men” (Fig. 5C).

(iv) “féminisme” made early inroads in France, but the US
proved to be a more fertile environment in the long run (Fig.
5D).

(v) “Galileo”, “Darwin”, and “Einstein” may be well-known
scientists, but “Freud” is more deeply engrained in our
collective subconscious (Fig. 5E).

(v1) Interest in “evolution” was waning when “DNA”
came along (Fig. 5F).

(vii) The history of the American diet offers many
appetizing opportunities for future research; the menu
includes “steak”, “sausage”, “ice cream’, “hamburger”,
“pizza”, “pasta”, and “sushi” (Fig. 5G).

(viil) “God” is not dead; but needs a new publicist (Fig.
5H).

These, together with the billions of other trajectories that
accompany them, will furnish a great cache of bones from
which to reconstruct the skeleton of a new science.
