Fig. 1. “Culturomic” analyses study millions of books at
once. (A) Top row: authors have been writing for millennia;
~129 million book editions have been published since the
advent of the printing press (upper left). Second row:
Libraries and publishing houses provide books to Google for
scanning (middle left). Over 15 million books have been
digitized. Third row: each book is associated with metadata.
Five million books are chosen for computational analysis
(bottom left). Bottom row: a culturomic “timeline” shows the
frequency of “apple” in English books over time (1800-
2000). (B) Usage frequency of “slavery.” The Civil War
(1861-1865) and the civil rights movement (1955-1968) are
highlighted in red. The number in the upper left (1e-4) is the
unit of frequency. (C) Usage frequency over time for “the
Great War” (blue), “World War I” (green), and “World War
II” (red).

Fig. 2. Culturomics has profound consequences for the study
of language, lexicography, and grammar. (A) The size of the
English lexicon over time. Tick marks show the number of
single words in three dictionaries (see text). (B) Fraction of
words in the lexicon that appear in two different dictionaries
as a function of usage frequency. (C) Five words added by
the AHD in its 2000 update. Inset: Median frequency of new
words added to AHD4 in 2000. The frequency of half of these
words exceeded 10” as far back as 1890 (white dot). (D)
Obsolete words added to AHD4 in 2000. Inset: Mean
frequency of the 2220 AHD headwords whose current usage
frequency is less than 10°. (E) Usage frequency of irregular
verbs (red) and their regular counterparts (blue). Some verbs
(chide/chided) have regularized during the last two centuries.
The trajectories for “speeded” and “speed up” (green) are
similar, reflecting the role of semantic factors in this instance
of regularization. The verb “burn” first regularized in the US
(US flag) and later in the UK (UK flag). The trregular
“snuck” is rapidly gaining on “sneaked.” (F) Scatter plot of
the irregular verbs; each verb’s position depends on its
regularity (see text) in the early 19th century (x-coordinate)
and in the late 20th century (y-coordinate). For 16% of the
verbs, the change in regularity was greater than 10% (large
font). Dashed lines separate irregular verbs (regularity<50%)
