Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-2 Filed 04/16/19 Page 3 of 4

After leveling these claims in detail, you say that | “steadfastly denied her claims.” Not
only did | deny the claims, | conclusively disproved them. | produced my travel, phone,
credit card, and TY appearance records conclusively proving | could not have been and
was not in any of the places Roberts claims | was during the time that she knew
Epstein. The former Director of the F.B.|., assisted by a former assistant U.S, attorney
and a chief federal marshal, reviewed these records and the other evidence and
concluded that ‘the totality of the evidence found during the investigation refutes the
allegations.” The judge struck Robert's affidavit and sanctioned her lawyers for filing it,
and her lawyers then withdrew their accusation admitting that it was a mistake. After
reviewing the evidence, ABC News cancelled their plan to show an interview with
Roberts because she was not credible.

There is other evidence, currently under seal, that directly establishes my innocence. |
am seeking to unseal emails between Roberts and a journalist, a book manuscript by
Roberts and a legal brief that are smoking guns showing that | was “deliberately
framed for financial reasons.”

There is also irrefutable evidence that Roberts lied about other people for money. She
told a British tabloid that she met Al and Tipper Gore on Epstein’s Island and she
swore that she had dinner with Bill Clinton on the Island. But Secret Service records
prove that none of these people were on the Island. |ndeed, the Gores didn’t even
know Epstein.

| have a tape recording of a conversation with Robert's closest friend in which she says
that Roberts told her she “felt pressure to go after [Dershowitz]” in order to obtain
money from a wealthy businessman, and that Roberts had never previously included
me among the people with whom she claimed to have had sex.
