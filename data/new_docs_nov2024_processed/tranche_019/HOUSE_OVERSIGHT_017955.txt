Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 21 of 28

Dershowitz participated in her sexual trafficking and abuse. In his public statements, Dershowitz
conspicuously omits any reference to the statements by Roberts’ lawyers after they had
investigated his representations and concluded that they were false.

75. Faced with the mounting evidence of his guilt, Dershowitz abandoned his attempt
to get Roberts or her lawyer to concede a mistake or that Roberts had been wrong, and
desperately sought even a suggestion that an error was “possible”.

76. In December 2015 Ms. Roberts’ counsel again told Mr. Dershowitz that “Virginia
is adamant about her current recollection” and that neither Ms. Roberts nor her counsel believed
she was mistaken in identifying Mr. Dershowitz as one of the men to whom Epstein had lent her
out for sex. In response, Mr. Dershowitz did not claim that Ms. Roberts lawyers had told him
that they did not believe her.

77. Instead, the morning of December 9, 2015, Mr. Dershowitz pleaded: “David,
Have we given up on a mutually acceptable statement from VR or you. Let’s keep trying. We are
not that far apart.” (Exhibit 15). When Ms. Roberts lawyer did not immediately respond, Mr.
Dershowitz wrote later the same day:

“We should be aiming at a short simple statement such as: “The
events at issue occurred approximately 15 years ago when I was a
teenager. Although I believed then and continued to believe that AD
was the person with whom I had sex, recent developments raise the
possibility that this may be a case of mistaken identification.”
(Exhibit 15).
Mr. Dershowitz went on to write: “It would be acceptable if the statement came from you rather

than her, if she prefers.” (/d.)
