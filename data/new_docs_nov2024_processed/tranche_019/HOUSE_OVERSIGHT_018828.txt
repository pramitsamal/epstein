Area Analysis 18

The current situation is that the recovering housing market and general economic conditions on the
US mainland is slowly having a positive impact in the US Virgin Islands’ real estate market in terms of
overall average home prices as well as the number of homes sold. Home sales in the territory, while
still lower than 2007 figures, have increased annually since 2012.

According to statistical data provided by the Multiple Listing Service, the value of real estate sales in
the St. Thomas-St. Croix MLS grew by 54% in 2014 to nearly $200 million on 883 transactions; volume
seen since 2008 and sales pace not seen since 2007. This growth follows 20% growth in 2013 which
came after six years of declines. The average sales price surpassed $300,000, a level also not seen
since 2008.

Real Estate Ownership and Taxation

Ownership is “fee simple”, under the U.S. flag. There are no restrictions against purchasing solely for
investment, and no laws dictating when, if ever, you must build on undeveloped land. It should be
noted that for 2006 there was a reassessment, and the tax rate changed to $3.77 per $1,000 based on
100% of assessed value (for residential property); however, there was an ongoing court challenge to
the reassessment, and a federal injunction blocked tax bills until the issue could be resolved. As of
December, 2013, the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax bills have all been issued under
the old 1999 assessed values and tax rates. This federal court injunction regarding the tax
reassessment of VI property values had previously prevented the government from collecting property
tax for at least four years, resulting in the government losing USS25 million a month. New assessed
values as well as amended tax rates were released in conjunction with the 2013 tax bills in August,
2014. Subsequent tax bills were issued at a rate of two per year until August 2015 when the 2015 bill
were released and the Virgin Islands became current with respect to its property taxes.
