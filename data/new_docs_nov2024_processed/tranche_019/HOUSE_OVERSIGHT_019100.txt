“Thank you for sharing this! | truly appreciate your thoughts here. |
read about this woman's complaint last week, and the whole event turned
my stomach. What Tosh did was personally threatening, which is not
OK. But even though | fall neatly into the feminist camp, | think your
original joke is hilarious—within context, and coming from a comedian
whose philosophy | identify with. Color me conflicted.”

| think that kind of conflict is healthy. And then there was Louis
C.K.’ s appearance on 7he Daily Show. This is what he told Jon Stewart
between interruptions:

“If this [controversy about Tosh] is like a fight between comedians
and bloggers--hyperbole and garbage comes out of those two places, just
uneducated, unfettered--it' s also a fight between comedians and
feminists, because they’ re natural enemies, because, stereotypically
speaking, feminists can’ t take a joke, and on the other side, comedians
can’ t take criticism. Comedians are big pussies. So to one side you say,

‘If you don’ t like a joke, stay out of the comedy clubs.’ To the other
side you say, ‘If you don’ t like criticism, stop Googling yourself every
ten seconds, because nobody’ s making you read it.’ It’ s positive. To

me, all dialogue is positive. | think you should listen.
