Forecasted Budget

The total operating cost of the project is estimated at US$359,731.

The financing will be obtained as by contributions by members of the organization, grants by
philanthropists interested in such projects, companies that specialize in assembly, under conditions
that comply with the regulations and bylaws of the NGO, and by international financial backers
interested in the development of Haiti.

The listed prices on schedules C, D, and E represent an on average estimate based upon utilizing
marketplace prices for items quoted within the United States as well as the professional experience
of the President of the organization. Schedules A and B were determined based on a blend of
Haitian labor rates as well as some influence from US labor rates. The budgeted amounts for labor
are considered heavily competitive within the Haitian workforce.
