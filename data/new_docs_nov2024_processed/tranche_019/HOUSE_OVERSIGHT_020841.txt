With these trends, USA Inc. will not be immune to the sudden crises that have afflicted others
with similar unfunded liabilities, leverage, and productivity trends. The sovereign credit issues in
Europe suggest what might lie ahead for USA Inc. shareholders — and our children. In effect,
USA Inc. is maxing out its credit card. It has fallen into a pattern of spending more than it earns
and is issuing debt at nearly every turn. Common principles for overcoming this kind of burden
include the following:

1) Acknowledge the problem — some 80% of Americans believe ‘dealing with our growing
budget deficit and national debt’ is a national priority, according to a Peter G. Peterson
Foundation survey in 11/09;

2) Examine past errors — People need clear descriptions and analysis to understand how the
US arrived at its current financial condition — a ‘turnaround CEO’ would certainly initiate a
‘no holds barred’ analysis of the purpose, success and operating efficiency of all of USA
Inc.’s spending;

3) | Make amends for past errors — Most Americans today at least acknowledge the problems
at personal levels and say they rarely or never spend more than what they can afford (63%
according to a 2007 Pew Research study). The average American knows the importance
of managing a budget. Perhaps more would be willing to sacrifice for the greater good with
an understandable plan to serve the country’s long-term best interests;

4) Develop a new code of behavior — Policymakers, businesses (including investment firms),
and citizens need to share responsibility for past failures and develop a plan for future
successes.

Past generations of Americans have responded to major challenges with collective
sacrifice and hard work. Will ours also rise to the occasion?
