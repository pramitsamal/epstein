Entitlement Spending: Clarification On

‘Unfunded’ / ‘Net Responsibilities’...

There is debate about the semantics of using words like unfunded / net
responsibilities to describe the financial status of entitlement programs like Social
Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

‘Unfunded’ — We define ‘unfunded’ liabilities for Social Security and Medicare as
the present value of future expenditures in excess of dedicated future revenue.
We call Social Security and Medicare ‘partially unfunded’ entitlement programs
as their future expenditures are projected to exceed dedicated future revenue.

e ‘Net Responsibilities’ — USA Inc. does not record these ‘unfunded’ financial
commitments as explicit liabilities on balance sheet, owing to Federal accounting
standards.

— USA Inc.’s Dept. of Treasury calls these commitments ‘net responsibilities’
or ‘net expenditures’ in its annual Financial Report of the U.S. Government.

e Medicaid — We view Medicaid as an ‘unfunded’ liability as there is no dedicated
revenue source to match expected expenses in our financial analysis. Medicaid
is jointly funded on a pay-as-you go basis by Federal and State general tax
revenue.

P Note: 1) per Dept. of Treasury, “2004 Financial Report of the United States Government.”
