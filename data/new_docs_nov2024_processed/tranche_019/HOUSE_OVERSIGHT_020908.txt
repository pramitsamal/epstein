Social Security: Observations

e 52 million retired Americans (17% of population) received an
average of $11,826 (in 2005 dollars) in Social Security payments
(32% of USA per-capita income) in 2009.

e By comparison, 10 million retired Americans (6% of population)
received an average of $5,447 (in 2005 dollars) in Social Security
payments (51% of per-capita income) in 1957.

e When Social Security was created in early 20 century to provide
retirement income to elderly Americans, 1 in 127 Americans’ (<1% of
population) received Social Security payments. Now 1 in 6 Americans
(17%) receive Social Security payments...well above the initial ‘plan.’
