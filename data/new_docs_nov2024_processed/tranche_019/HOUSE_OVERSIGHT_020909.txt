Think About That...

lf you are a worker in USA, Inc.
(as 81 million tax-paying

Americans are), in effect, you have
5 times more ‘dependents” than
your parents had and 15 times
more than your grandparents.

1 Note: * Dependents’ = retirees who receive Social Security benefits primarily funded via payroll taxes on current working population.
