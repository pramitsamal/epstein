Investors Struggle with Today’s Low ~4% Risk Free Rate

¢ Pension funds & other investors look for ~8% annual returns
in order to meet promised payouts.

¢ The challenge is far greater than before given:
- Rising obligations relative to income
- Lower interest rates

¢ Promises (e.g., pension, healthcare) made during an 8%
interest rate environment are much harder to meet when the
risk free rate has fallen from 8% to 3.6%. '

¢ The choice is either to reduce obligations...
or

...INvest in riskier assets.
