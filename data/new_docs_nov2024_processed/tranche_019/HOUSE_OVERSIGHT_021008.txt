At a High Level, With Focus on Improving Operating Efficiency,

USA Inc. Might Consider Ways to Do Things Like...

e Consider empowering an independent / 3 party auditor with expertise in government
operations around the world / corporate turnarounds to conduct a broad-ranging audit of
USA Inc.’s operations.

e Restore strong rules for budget process: Require annual budget resolutions and
reconciliation; PAYGO* to limit spending, enforce annual appropriations process consider
biennial budgeting.

e Consider giving the President ‘line-item’ veto / rescission authority.

e Empower commissions analogous to the military base closing panels to review and
consolidate government functions and agencies, as well as aid to State and local
governments.

e Seek flexibility to manage performance and terminate poor-performing Federal employees.

e Develop flexible / long-term compensation plans including bonus payments for Federal
employees when annual budget deficit reduction goals are met.

e Privatize government real estate and other assets with little use, expanding on current
efforts to trim $3 billion in government-owned real estate.

e Identify additional opportunities to increase public/private investment, management and
operations to drive innovation and investment in infrastructure

Note: PAYGO is the practice of financing expenditures with funds that are currently available rather than borrowed.
