It’s Easy to Gripe About USA Inc.’s High Expense Levels...

That Said, High Expenses Could be Covered by High Revenue

e There are two primary drivers of USA Inc.’s revenue: 1) GDP growth and 2)
related tax levies on consumers and businesses.

e To bring its income statement mechanically to break-even for 2009 (excluding one-
time charges), USA Inc. would have needed to raise individual income tax rates by
~2x across-the-board to an average of ~26-30% (from ~13%) of gross income.' This
certainly seems draconian. And a tax increase of this nature would surely have a
significant negative impact on USA’s GDP growth as consumers would have far less
disposable income to buy goods and services.

e This brings us to a key element of USA’s financial challenges — the need to drive
economic (GDP) AND related job growth. This is not easy. A material portion of GDP
growth over the past few decades was driven by rising consumption aided by rising
leverage and we have now entered a period of de-leveraging.

e Stronger economic growth would be hugely beneficial for USA Inc.’s revenues. But
the legacy of the financial crisis - severe housing imbalances and the need to
complete the long process of writing off private mortgage debt — means that the US
recovery will probably remain slow for at least several years. The silver lining: A
booming global economy should provide a modest lift to US growth.

Note: 1) USA Inc.’s F2009 revenue shortfall was $997B (excluding one-time discretionary spending items). F2009 total
income tax receipts from individuals were $915B. As a result, if one were to raise individual income tax rates alone to achieve

[ financial break-even, one would have to more than double individual income tax rates across-the-board.

Drive Growth: If Real GDP Grows 0.1 Percentage Point Faster Than Current
CBO Projection For F2011-F2020E, the Budget Deficit Could Shrink by 5%

Without Other Policy Changes

e CBO analysis shows that for every 0.1 percentage point (pps) increase in real GDP annual
growth rate above CBO’s baseline estimate for F2011-F2020E, USA Inc.’s revenue (driven
by taxes) could be $247 billion higher, spending could be $41 billion lower (driven by
reduced welfare spending) and the budget deficit could be reduced by $288 billion, or 5%.
