- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in

an unwelcome manner.

- The conference attendee who took the ‘selfie’ photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers
at the time of the incident (November 2016).

- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers
at the time of the incident (November 2016).

The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact.

- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took
the ‘selfie’ photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested
in the course of the investigation.”

(And for the record | often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as | specifically request selfies not to include flashes,
so that | don’t end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour)

What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that | get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come
up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. | am particularly proud of the way | attempt to make all
people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what | am about, which is to
acknowledge fans in a way that makes them feel appreciated. As | understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take
selfies at the CFl conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, | am proud of the
interactions | have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and ethnicities. | have worked hard
to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. | treat others as responsible adults, and | expect to be treated equally.

First draft:

It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part.
Needless to say, | treat people | interact with with respect, and | work hard to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members
of the general public. | do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that that Universities and
other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high
public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and
allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that | have remained a professor
in all Universities with which | have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like
CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they trust my behavior. | was asked to be an honorary
director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees
universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is
to impugn my integrity or suggest | have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts’, as a
scientist | try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations and innuendo. | also try and judge the facts
in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is
because they value my contributions and my actions.

Your specific allegations are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we mutually
decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. |
cannot comment on item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim, because | know nothing about it, and it was not taken
seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because | decided | didn’t want to go out
to a bar with a group of attendees that | was harassing them? The second part is false. | don’t do that. Re incident 5: The ‘female
companion’ in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that the claim is false, which is what | wrote in response to the blog in
question, causing it to be taken down.

It is worthwhile responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,
