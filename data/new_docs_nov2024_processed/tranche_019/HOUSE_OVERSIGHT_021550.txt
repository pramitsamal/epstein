Rich man fought the law
— and he mostly won

Two years after a grand jury
indicted him on a felony charge of
solicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey
Epstein finally admitted that he
luréd a teenage girl to his $8.5 mil-
lion, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach
mansion for sex. A week ago, the
‘55-year-old investment banker be-
gan serving 18 months in jail.

But that plea deal — guilty of
felony solicitation of prostitution
and procuring a person under the
age of 18 for prostitution — does
not account for all five of the girls,
one as young as 14, who alleged that

‘Epstein sexually abused them. And
why is Epstein serving his
term in the overcrowded

The slow, dissatisfy-
ing resolution of the case
sends a message to the
public that there’s a dif
ferent system of justice for
the wealthy who hire high-powered
lawyers. Epstein’s legal team includ-
ed West Palm Beach defense attor-
ney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law
School Professor Alan Dershowitz,
who defended O.J. Simpson against
murder charges, and Kenneth
Starr, the prosecutor who pursued
then-President Bill Clinton for lying
about sex with young women.

Palm Beach police spent 11
months investigating Epstein be-
fore State Attorney Barry Krischer
sent the case to a grand jury, in-
stead of charging Epstein so the
man who once boasted of accepting
only billionaire clients could face a
trial. The police had taken a high
school transcript, class schedules
and phone messages from Epstein’s

were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer
was more swayed by Epstein’s law-
yers, who attempted to impugn the
girls’ character by showing they
had chatted on myspace.com about
smoking marijuana and drinking.
He should have let a jury decide
whether the victims — and Epstein
— were credible.

Epstein also won’t have to cer

of sex offenders, because he has
a private psychiatrist. But without
court supervision, who will ensure
Epstein is in fact being treated?

The plea deal also drops a federal
