Only then did Zloch learn that McDaniel had preyed on other girls over the internet,
including a 16-year-old California girl whom he brought to Texas and impregnated.
He was also having another relationship with a 15-year-old girl at the time of his
arrest, Villafafa admitted in court.

The judge promptly sentenced McDaniel to 10 years — twice what Villafana
recommended.

Three months later, in January 2007, after reviewing the entire case, Zloch issued
an order excoriating Villafaiia for failing to tell him about McDaniel’s prior history.

“The serial nature of defendant’s seduction of minor girls was revealed for the first
time to the court upon the Government’s response to the Court’s inquiry,” Zloch
wrote, explaining that the defendant’s past was evidence of predatory behavior that
watranted a harsher sentence because he may pose a danger to the community.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lourie was assigned to try to correct the record and
persuade the judge to strike a portion of his comments. They argued that since
McDaniel had never before been charged with a crime, the history was not relevant
