allegations . She claimed in the minutest of detail , her dinner with President Clinton on the
Caribean Island, How he arrived . ( by black heli). where he sat. ,(on jeffreys left.) a

21st century tale of power, sex, money. The fact is that this story is total make believe ,
fabricated on purpose to gain tabloid attention ,and easily refuted by readily availalble travel
records of a former president. . it defies belief that any person would take seriously such a
preposterous story. little different than her telling her father that she met the queen, whoops- he
believed her though her mother at the relevant time complained that she must have been engaging
in satan worship and asked that she be put her in a drug home. cmon. | am currenty a
professional pilot with a spotless record. | have a checklist that | follow before every flight to verify
that things are what they are supposed to be , checking her story which the presss has refused to
do would serve the public well. In this case human error is merely a euphmisn for hijacking the truth
