Q. Okay. But other than referring the two
parties to the Bar, you never entered, to your

recollection, striking a party's pleadings; is that

right?
A. That's right.
Q. Okay. I want to ask you a few questions

about the issue of striking pleadings. Would you agree
with me that courts generally disfavor a motion to
strike?

A. No.

Q. And that striking allegations from a pleading
is a drastic remedy to be resorted to only when required
for the purposes of justice and only when the
allegations to be stricken have no possible relation to
the controversy?

A. I think that's what some courts have said,
yes.

Q. And is it fair to say -- is that what you
represented to the court in response to
Professor Dershowitz's application to intervene?

A. That's right.

Q. And you wouldn't have represented that to the
court unless you believed it to be accurate; is that
right?

A. That's right.
