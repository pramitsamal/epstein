A. I'm not certain.
Q. Do you -- can you give any estimate at all?
A. You know, in this case, I've probably seen

reference to another in Florida, you know, maybe another
four or five academics that had some kind of interaction
with Epstein.

Q. And you are aware that Epstein was so closely
associated with Harvard, that he had his own office
there?

A. No, I didn't know that Mr. Epstein had an
office at Harvard.

Q. Did you know that Mr. Epstein regularly had
dinners and other social events in which there were
scores of distinguished academicians?

A. Are we talking about Florida or New York?

Q. Generally.

A. Yeah, I knew there was some events like that
in New York. I don't recall having specific information
about an event like that in -- in Palm Beach.

MR. SCAROLA: Richard, let me just make note
of the fact that it's almost 4:30, and by
agreement, we are going stop at 4:30, so if
there's something really pressing you want to get
in this afternoon, this would be a good time to
do that.
