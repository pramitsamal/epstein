HEADLINES DESPITE THE EARTHQUAKE,

Alan Dershowitz: September 2014

f the ongoing lawsuits are costing Epstein millions, he has
millions left to spare. Meanwhile, the FBI's investigation into
whether Epstein trafficked underage women across state lines
seems to be going nowhere. As 2014 draws to a close, it’s begin-
| ning to look as if Epstein is finally free and clear of the case.
But for Epstein’s friend and sometime lawyer Alan Dershow-
 itz, things are about to get very unpleasant.
At the start of 2008, Bradley Edwards, the Fort Lauderdale
3 lawyer, had filed a motion in a West Palm Beach court on behalf
of two unnamed women accusing Prince Andrew and Alan Der-
“showitz of participating directly in Epstein’s illegal activities.

Nz had objected to the accusations in the strongest possible

terms.

: “There's absolutely no kernel of truth to this story,” he'd said.
