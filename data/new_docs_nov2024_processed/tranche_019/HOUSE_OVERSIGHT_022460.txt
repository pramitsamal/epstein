“T hadn't previously heard of your magazine, but when I clicked over to your website my eye was
immediately caught by Gregory Chaitin's article, as he is one of my favorite mathematicians. I
also read with great pleasure Categories: From Zero to Infinity by Pierre Schapira, which did
an excellent job of communicating a highly technical subject. I'm now looking forward to
perusing the rest of the site when I have time!”

“Thank you very much for the invitation to write for your excellent journal. I have read many
wonderful essays in Inference, and would be honored to contribute, if only I had the time and
energy to do so.

I hope we can stay in touch and perhaps revisit the possibility of my writing for you at a future
time. I especially appreciate how long and technical, but still crystal clear, your articles tend to
be, permitting great depth and thoroughness. Congratulations to you and your team.”
