to determine whether the Guidelines would recommend
that incarceration is appropriate, the length of any term of
incarceration, and the appropriate amount of any fine. For
corporations, the offense level is modified by factors par-
ticular to organizations as described in Chapter 8 to deter-
mine the applicable organizational penalty.

For example, violations of the anti-bribery provi-
sions are calculated pursuant to § 2C1.1. The offense level
is determined by first identifying the base offense level;
adding additional levels based on specific offense charac-
teristics, including whether the offense involved more than
one bribe, the value of the bribe or the benefit that was con-
ferred, and the level of the public official;®° adjusting the
offense level based on the defendant's role in the offense;*!
and using the total offense level as well as the defendant’s
criminal history category to determine the advisory guide-
line range.*” For violations of the accounting provisions
assessed under § 2B1.1, the procedure is generally the
same, except that the specific offense characteristics differ.
For instance, for violations of the FCPA’s accounting pro-
visions, the offense level may be increased if a substantial
part of the scheme occurred outside the United States or if
the defendant was an officer or director of a publicly traded
company at the time of the offense.??

For companies, the offense level is calculated pur-
suant to §§ 2C1.1 or 2B1.1 in the same way as for an
individual—by starting with the base offense level and
increasing it as warranted by any applicable specific
offense characteristics. The organizational guidelines
found in Chapter 8, however, provide the structure for
determining the final advisory guideline fine range for
organizations. The base fine consists of the greater of the
amount corresponding to the total offense level, calcu-
lated pursuant to the Guidelines, or the pecuniary gain or
loss from the offense.>** This base fine is then multiplied
by a culpability score that can either reduce the fine to as
little as five percent of the base fine or increase the recom-
mended fine to up to four times the amount of the base
fine.’ As described in § 8C2.5, this culpability score is
calculated by taking into account numerous factors such

as the size of the organization committing the criminal

acts; the involvement in or tolerance of criminal activ-
ity by high-level personnel within the organization; and
prior misconduct or obstructive behavior. The culpability
score is reduced if the organization had an effective pre-
existing compliance program to prevent violations and if
the organization voluntarily disclosed the offense, cooper-
ated in the investigation, and accepted responsibility for

the criminal conduct.?*°

Civil Penalties

Although only DOJ has the authority to pursue crim-
inal actions, both DOJ and SEC have civil enforcement
authority under the FCPA. DOJ may pursue civil actions
for anti-bribery violations by domestic concerns (and their
officers, directors, employees, agents, or stockholders) and
foreign nationals and companies for violations while in the
United States, while SEC may pursue civil actions against
issuers and their officers, directors, employees, agents, or
stockholders for violations of the anti-bribery and the
accounting provisions.**”

For violations of the anti-bribery provisions, cor-
porations and other business entities are subject to a civil
penalty of up to $16,000 per violation.>* Individuals,
including officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of
companies, are similarly subject to a civil penalty of up to
$16,000 per violation,**? which may not be paid by their
employer or principal3®

For violations of the accounting provisions, SEC may
obtain a civil penalty not to exceed the greater of (a) the
gross amount of the pecuniary gain to the defendant as a
result of the violations or (b) a specified dollar limitation.
The specified dollar limitations are based on the egregious-
ness of the violation, ranging from $7,500 to $150,000 for
an individual and $75,000 to $725,000 for a company.*
SEC may obtain civil penalties both in actions filed in fed-

eral court and in administrative proceedings3”

Collateral Consequences
In addition to the criminal and civil penalties described
above, individuals and companies who violate the FCPA may

face significant collateral consequences, including suspension
