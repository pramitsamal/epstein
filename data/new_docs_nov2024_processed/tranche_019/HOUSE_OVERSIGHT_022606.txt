95-640], available at http ://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/
history/1977/houseprt-95-640.pdf. ‘The House Report made clear
Congress's concerns:

The payment of bribes to influence the acts or

decisions of foreign officials, foreign political parties

or candidates for foreign political office is unethical.

It is counter to the moral expectations and values of

the American public. But not only is it unethical, it

is bad business as well. It erodes public confidence

in the integrity of the free market system. It short-

circuits the marketplace by directing business to

those companies too inefficient to compete in terms

of price, quality or service, or too lazy to engage in

honest salesmanship, or too intent upon unloading

marginal products. In short, it rewards corruption

instead of efficiency and puts pressure on ethical

enterprises to lower their standards or risk losing

business.

asevere threat to domestic and international security has galvanized
efforts to combat it in the United States and abroad. See, CLs Intl Anti-
Corruption and Good Governance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-309,
§ 202, 114 Stat. 1090 (codified as amended at 22 US.C. §§ 2151-2152
(2000)) (noting that “[w]idespread corruption endangers the stability
and security of societies, undermines democracy, and jeopardizes the
social, political, and economic development ofa society. vee [and that]
[clorruption facilitates criminal activities, such as money laundering,
hinders economic development, inflates the costs of doing business, and
undermines the legitimacy of the government and public trust”).

> President George W. Bush observed in 2006 that “the culture of
corruption has undercut development and good governance and

.... impedes our efforts to promote freedom and democracy, end
poverty, and combat international crime and terrorism.” President’s
Statement on Kleptocracy, 2 Pus. Papers 1504 (Aug. 10, 2006),
available at http i//; georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/ news/
releases/2006/08/20060810.html. The administrations of former
President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama both recognized
the threats posed to security and stability by corruption. For instance,

in issuing a proclamation restricting the entry of certain corrupt foreign
public officials, former President George W. Bush recognized “the
serious negative effects that corruption of public institutions has on the
United States’ efforts to promote security and to strengthen democratic
institutions and free market systems... .” Proclamation No. 7750, 69
Fed. Reg. 2287 (Jan. 14, 2004). Similarly, President Barack Obama's
National Security Strategy paper, released in May 2010, expressed the
administration’s efforts and commitment to promote the recognition that
“pervasive corruption is a violation of basic human rights and a severe
impediment to development and global security.” THE WHITE House,
