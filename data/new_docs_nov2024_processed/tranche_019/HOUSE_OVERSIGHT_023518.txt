May 26 -- Conventional wisdom is fast congealing in Washington
that President Obama was wrong to demarcate a shift in American
policy toward Israel last week. In fact, it was Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu who broke with the past — in one of a series of
diversions and obstacles Netanyahu has come up with anytime he is
pressed. He wins in the short run, but ultimately, he is turning himself
