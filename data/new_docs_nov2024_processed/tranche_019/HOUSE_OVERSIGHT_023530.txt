Why Palestinians Have Time on Their
Side
Jeffrey Goldberg

May 24, 2011 -- If I were a Palestinian (and, should there be any
confusion on this point, I am not), and if I were the sort of Palestinian
who believed that Israel should be wiped off the map, then I would be
quite pleased with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
performance before Congress this morning.

I would applaud Netanyahu for including no bold initiatives that
would have suggested to the world that Israel is alive to the threat
posed by its seemingly eternal occupation of the West Bank.

In fact, I would make support for Netanyahu the foundation stone of
my patient campaign to dismantle the world’s only majority-Jewish
country. I would support not only Netanyahu, but the far-right parties
of his governing coalition, the parties that seem uninterested in
democracy and obsessed with planting more Jewish settlements on
the West Bank.

The settlements would have my wholehearted backing. I would
encourage my brother Palestinians to help build settlements at a brisk
pace. I would ask the Israelis to build an even more intricate system
of bypass roads on the West Bank that would connect Jewish
settlements to one another and to Israel proper. I would ask my
ostensible allies among the Arab nations to provide interest-free
mortgages to Israelis in Tel Aviv, so they could move out to the
settlements for some fresh air and a little more yard. And, while I was
at it, I would insist that my leaders abort their campaign for United
Nations recognition of an independent state of Palestine.
