Defining Intelligence 155

one must be able to explain one’s reasoning clearly to those who ask.
And, one must have a knowledge base of relevant information to draw
upon. But our education system, in concentrating only on the knowl-
edge base and not on independent reasoning from that knowledge
base, has ensured that the knowledge base remains incomprehensible
to most people and therefore is immediately forgotten after school is
over.

It would be a good idea to eliminate IQ tests as a measure of intel-
ligence and begin to teach people to do diagnosis, to plan well, to be
able to determine causality, and to clearly explain their reasoning to
others.

Those that cannot learn to do this would rightly be called stupid,
but those who can would rightly be called intelligent.

Degrees of intelligence would be about one’s ability to do this for
more and more complex issues in complex domains.
