How Not to Teach

Some people will never learn anything, for this reason, because
they understand everything too soon.
—Alexander Pope

My daughter learned a lot from me and from her surroundings when
she was small. All children learn all the time when they are little.
But what are they learning? When Hana was about 1-1/2 we lived in
Switzerland. Hana was my parent’s first grandchild. Since they were in
New York, there were frequent phone calls back and forth and more
than the occasional visit. Once during this period I got curious as
to whether Hana knew the names of her grandparents. I figured she
might not know the word name so I asked her, “What does Gammy
(her name for my mother) call Poppy (my father). She immediately
responded, “Maaacc!!” imitating the intonation and exasperation of
my mother trying to get my father’s attention. I asked what my father
called my mother, and she said “Marge!” in the tone of an authorita-
tive military call.

Hana talked to her grandparents on the phone quite a bit. One day
I noticed her walking in furious circles while she was talking, at one
point almost bringing the phone down on her head. Now who had
been teaching her that? Well... me. That’s what I do when I talk on
the phone. And it is still what my daughter does, 30 years later.

Speaking of 30 years later (well, 20 in this story), I observed this
same seemingly imitative behavior in Hana when she was in college.
I remarked to a friend of my daughter who went to school with her in
Evanston that there was a no left turn sign in Evanston (where I also
worked) that I always ignored because it was so stupid. She said that
my daughter always ignored the same sign and also said it was stupid.
The curious part of this story is that my daughter and I, having our
own cars and lives, had never been in a car together in Evanston and
neither had we ever discussed this sign.
