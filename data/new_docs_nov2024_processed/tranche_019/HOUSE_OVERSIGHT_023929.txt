How the Best Universities
Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools

We have met the enemy, and he is us.
—VWalt Kelly

It should come as no surprise to readers of this book that I never re-
ally liked school. I endured it. I didn’t have the option to quit—an
unthinkable idea in my household. In the end I even wound up with
a Yale degree (all right, an honorary one—but it is printed in Latin).
Truth be told, I did get a real Ph.D., but that was more a testament to

kids also hated school, I began to wonder about why school was the
way it was and why it really had so little to do with learning as I un-

Eventually I realized that I was part of the problem. I readily had
found employment in a world that let me think about interesting
problems all day and work with really smart graduate students. To

I talked. Students listened or at least faked listening, and then there
were grades to be given out based on how well they actually had been
listening. I didn’t like this game any more as a teacher than I had
