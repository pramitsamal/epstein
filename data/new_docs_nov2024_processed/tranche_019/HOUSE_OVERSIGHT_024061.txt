treated as an offset to the Management Fee; provided, however,
that the Management Fee shall not be reduced below zero. Any
reimbursement of the General Partner, the Management
Company or the Managers for out-of-pocket expenses incurred
on behalf of a portfolio company will not offset the
Management Fee.
