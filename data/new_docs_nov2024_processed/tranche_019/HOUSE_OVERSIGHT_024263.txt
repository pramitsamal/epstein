Day 4: Private Infrastructures for Government Surveillance

Digital privacy has at times been understood as privacy against corporate intrusion (think ad
networks); against government (think the various government intelligence-gathering
establishments around the world); and against one another (think drones as well as more
pedestrian technologies that empower people to document facts about, or even doxx, each
other).

This session will look at the second form of surveillance, especially as effectuated through the
cooperation or compulsion of private intermediaries. How successful is such surveillance, and
will it continue to be effective as the public reacts by potentially adopting privacy-enhancing
tools? How successful do we want it to be, and how might frameworks agreeable within
jurisdictions that embrace the rule of law be used or abused within those that do not?
