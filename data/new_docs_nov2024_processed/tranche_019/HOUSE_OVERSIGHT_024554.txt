ventures, provide for a capital structure which provides for high-vote and low-vote (or non-voting)
securities with substantially equivalent economic rights intended to correspond to the voting and
economic structure of KUE (taking into account differences in legal form, such that corporate subsidiaries
do not have specified distribution or liquidation rights with respect fo common stock). Notwithstanding
any contrary provisions below addressing equal merger consideration, to the extent securities of an entity
corresponding to the voting structure of KUE are to be distributed tc the Partners, the high-vote securities
shall be distributed to KUE LLC for purposes of maintaining the voting structure subsequent to such
distribution, as long as the securities otherwise have substantially equivalent economic rights and the
high-vote securities have mandatory conversion features equivalent to the mandatory conversion features
of the Class B Shares of the General Partner (as discussed below), it being understood that securities
with high-voting rights shall not be deemed to have a higher economic value than securities with limited or
no voting rights solely by reason of the disparity in voting rights.
