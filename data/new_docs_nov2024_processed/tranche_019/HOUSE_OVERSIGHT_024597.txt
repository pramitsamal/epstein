example in the 1970s when he had declared that Libyan sovereignty
extended to 200 miles off its coast, when international waters start at
12 miles. He declared that anyone who crossed this line of death
would be subject to attack. The U.S. was planning maneuvers in the
Gulf of Sidra and went inside this 200-mile zone. Qadhafi sent out
three sorties of jets against them, which were promptly shot down.
But after, it was interesting. He said, I want to thank the United
States for making me a hero to the Third World. Standing tall
against a superior adversary has great value in the Arab world.

In your view, is there anything that Qadhafi could have done to
remain in power or is he just fundamentally out of touch with
Libya today?

One should remember back to Saddam Hussein again, and how long
it was before we finally found him. I believe that until the end he
believed that he could get past this and would reach heroic stature for
standing up against the enemy, and that his people would support
him. A couple of questions get asked about leaders here. A, would he
go off to a lush exile as, say, [former Haitian president] Baby Doc
Duvalier did? Or B, would he commit suicide? I don't think either of
those is in the cards for Qadhafi. In fact, he gave this defiant speech
on August 21, which insisted that he was in Tripoli and wouldn't
surrender: We cannot go back until the last drop of our blood. I am
here with you. Go on. Go forward. And in a brief television
statement the same day, Go out and take your weapons, all of you.
There should be no fear. It's a rather different thing than Churchill,
who was advised to move out of London and instead stayed there to
absorb the Blitz along with the British people. He was sort of a role
model for heroism and spoke—again in the first person plural—
about, We will stand tall, we will resist this tyranny. It was really
