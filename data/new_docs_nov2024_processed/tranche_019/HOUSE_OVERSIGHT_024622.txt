International Community to support Palestine to end the occupation.
However, there will be a slim chance for the admission of the state of
Palestine into the United Nations if the US, or any other permanent
members of the UN Security Council uses the Veto in this regards. In
this situation, the General Assembly cannot vote for the Admission of
Palestine, as the International court of Justice ruled in its Advisory
Opinion of March 3, 1950, in its interpretation of the provisions of
Article 4 of the UN Charter.

The best procedure to be conducted in this regard is one of the
following:

a) To apply to the General Assembly of the UN asking them to
denounce the continuing Israeli occupation and to declare the strict
and unchangeable will of members of the United Nations to end the
occupation of all Palestinian lands occupied in 1967 and their
confirmation of the right of the Palestinian People to self-
determination and statehood in a full fledged independent state on
all occupied Palestinian Territories occupied in 1967, including East
Jerusalem living in peace side by side with Israel.

b) To ask the UN General Assembly to demand from the ICJ an
Advisory Opinion on the right of the Palestinian people to self-
determination and statehood on the occupied territories.

A resolution of the UN General Assembly, if taken by great majority
of more than 75 percent of the members and an Advisory Opinion
from the ICJ could have a great impact on most states and members
of the international community. They would also carry an important
moral pressure on both states and international civil society.

The Palestinians, Arab States, Arab public opinion and civil society
and other friends and supporters of the Palestinian people, should
play a very active role in organizing and administrating all possible
measures to properly invest and harness the said Resolution and/or
