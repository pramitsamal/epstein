Advisory Opinion.

One can give an example of the fruits of such good investment by
referring to what the prominent Israeli leading newspaper Ha'aretz
wrote in June 2011.

It referred to what several Israeli jurists and international law experts
were aware of: Palestine adhering to the Rome Statute of 1998 (the
ICC Statute), thus becoming a member of the ICC capable of
invoking its jurisdiction in cases of Israel committing war-crimes of
other similar crimes.

Such membership 1s possible if many states and/or members of the
ICC Statute are finally convinced that Palestine is a state which is
worth becoming a member of the said convention. In this regard, it
must be highlighted that the ICC Statute does not provide for states to
become members of the ICC but that they should be members of the
UNO. It only demands in all its Articles that Member States should
be States.

If support for Palestine is very high, it constitutes great pressure on
several states and may be a turning point in their attitude towards
Palestinian Statehood.
