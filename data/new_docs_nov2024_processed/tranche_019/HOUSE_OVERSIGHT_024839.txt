Liquid Chromatography And Gas Chromatography - How Does It Work?

LC instrumentation is generally composed of: (1) solvent delivery system, (2) sample
injector, (3) separation column, (4) detector, and (5) data acquisition unit. The solvent
delivery unit pumps the solvent through the LC system while the sample injector
introduces the sample into the solvent flow (known as the mobile phase). The
chromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by
the detector, which measures the presence and amount of constituents. The data
acquisition unit then records and stores the information from the detector. The
underlying principles of GC are similar to those of LC, with the key difference being that
the mobile phase is a gas instead of a liquid.

LC Is Often Combined With Mass Spec

To obtain the mass spectrum of a single compound in a mixture, the individual
components must be separated prior to MS analysis. Separation is necessary for
unambiguous identification because multiple compounds present simultaneously create
an overlapping or mixed spectrum. The most common separation techniques used in
combination with MS are gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC). LC
and MS from different vendors can be combined. LC is more commonly used as high
temperatures required for GC make it incompatible with the compounds under analysis -
this is a key reason why some cannabis testing labs prefer testing THC using liquid
chromatography (to be clear, analysis using gas chromatography requires heating THC
which changes its properties).
