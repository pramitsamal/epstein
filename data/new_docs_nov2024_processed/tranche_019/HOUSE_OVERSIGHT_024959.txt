peace with just one man, Hosni Mubarak. That sale is over. Today,
post-Mubarak, to sustain the peace treaty with Egypt in any kind of
stable manner, Israel is going to have to pay retail. It is going to have
to make peace with 85 million Egyptians. The days in which one
phone call by Israel to Mubarak could shut down any crisis in
relations are over.

Amr Moussa, the outgoing head of the Arab League and the front-
runner in polls to succeed Mubarak as president when Egypt holds
elections in November, just made that clear in an interview with The
Wall Street Journal. Regarding Israel, Moussa said: “Mubarak had a
certain policy. It was his own policy, and I don’t think we have to
follow this. We want to be a friend of Israel, but it has to have two
parties. It is not on Egypt to be a friend. Israel has to be a friend,
too.”

Moussa owes a great deal of his popularity in Egypt to his tough
approach to Israel. I hope he has a broader vision. It is noteworthy
that in the decade he led the Arab League, he spent a great deal of
time jousting with Israel and did virtually nothing to either highlight
or deal with the conclusions of the 2002 U.N. Arab Human
Development Report — produced by a group of Arab scholars led by
an Egyptian — that said the Arab people are suffering from three
huge deficits: a deficit of freedom, a deficit of knowledge and deficit
of women’s empowerment.

The current Israeli government, however, shows little sign of being
prepared for peace retail. I can’t say with any certainty that Israel has
a Palestinian partner for a secure peace so that Israel can end its
occupation of the West Bank. But I can say with 100 percent
certainty that Israel has a huge interest in going out of its way to test
that possibility. The Arab world is going through a tumultuous
transition to a still uncertain destination. Israel needs to do all it can
to get out of their story, because it is going to be a wild ride.
