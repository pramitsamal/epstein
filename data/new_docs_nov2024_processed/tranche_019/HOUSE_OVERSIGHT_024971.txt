his third term and announced his interest in running against President
Hosni Mubarak in the election scheduled for this year. In 2005, he
and the agency were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their
nonproliferation endeavors. Doubtless the Norwegian selectors,
always ready to needle American hawks, also sought to reward his
bold critique of the American-led war against Iraq, especially since
they drew ill-tempered ripostes from top officials in the Bush
administration, particularly “Dick Cheney and his faction.”

In many ways, this David-Goliath confrontation over Iraq both drove
E|Baradei in his years atop the I.A.E.A. and also inspired this
memoir. The Iraq story is well known. The Bush team insisted that
Saddam Hussein — who had cheated on nukes and chemical
weapons once before and been caught — had or was on the verge of
acquiring nuclear weapons, and they demanded I.A.E.A. inspections
of Iraq to confirm it. The agency conducted 247 inspections at 147
sites in Iraq from November 2002 until March 2003 and found no
violations and no nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, the United States
insisted on its own “evidence” and went to war. There can be no
exaggerating the negative effects of this experience on world opinion
toward the United States and upon ElBaradei himself as I.A.E.A.
chief.

E|Baradei’s self-proclaimed mission became preventing another Iraq-
type war. To this end, he significantly upgraded the agency’s
inspection capabilities, building on the work of his predecessor, Hans
Blix. At the same time, ElBaradei decried American
counterproliferation efforts as warmongering. These campaigns
provided the three themes of his memoir: the need to strengthen the
mandate and standing of the I.A.E.A., to restrain sword-waving by
the great powers (read the United States), and to emphasize
diplomacy and collective security instead.
