of Aleppo, which appears to have been
overrun by fighters from Ahrar al-Sham, a
battalion based in Idlib. Videos posted
Tuesday by the rebels showed them
walking past derelict Syrian warplanes and
inside a fortified hangar containing what
appeared to be two Czech-built ground

displayed dozens of bombs racked in a
warehouse, and other ammunition and

eThe Thawra hydroelectric dam on the
Euphrates, which is one of Syria’s biggest
power-generating facilities. Rebel sources
