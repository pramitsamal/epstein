that the economy is shouting for a party change. This does not bode well for the Democratic Party, which continues to endorse
the current status quo.

And to confirm GDP growth’s implications, we also have the disappointing measure of employment to adult population. Again,
there is every reason on Earth to change parties now. There literally has been no Obama recovery, and Hillary Clinton
promises she'll do more of the same. The U.S. has about 10 million fewer jobs per year than we would have had if the ratio
of employment to adult population were what it was in mid-2000.

Just compare the ascent of the employment to adult population ratio for the eight years of Obama to the Johnson years, or
even to the Nixon years, and especially to the Reagan and Clinton years. This Obama economy really isn’t a recovery, let
alone a strong recovery, as one would expect should have happened following the devastating collapse of the Great
Recession. Why would Hillary Clinton want to run on the Obama record? It’s beyond me.

Using detrended real GDP per adult and total employment per adult, there have been two elections since Truman was elected
in 1948 that appear to contradict my economic improvement hypothesis—the Nixon election in 1968 and the Obama reelection
in 2012. Both of these elections appear to have had very strong extraneous factors at work. For Nixon’s success, the huge
outrage against Johnson’s handling of the Vietnam War could well have overpowered the seemingly good economy and for
Obama in 2012 a high racial sensitivity quotient could also have tipped the scales. If anything, today the war and racial
sensitivity issues operate against the Democrats.

What | beg you to look at carefully are the virtually identical precipitous drops in the economy immediately preceding the

Presidencies of Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama and the totally opposite results during their respective Presidencies. | just
can’t see how a pro-Obama candidate can win in 2016.
