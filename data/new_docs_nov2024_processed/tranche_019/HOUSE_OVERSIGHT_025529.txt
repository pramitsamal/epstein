German Media Confess to
Underestimating Steve
Bannon; He Is ‘As Dangerous

by THOMAS D. WILLIAMS, PH.D.11 Mar 2018

As Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-
establishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but
admit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims.

In this week’s issue, the left-wing German weekly Svern articulates the greatest fear of the European
establishment: that Bannon “could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric.”
Many thought that the reign of the “Dark Lord” had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left
first the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that
Bannon’s adversaries had underestimated him, because he is “‘as dangerous as ever,” he confesses.
