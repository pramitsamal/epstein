Effectively the banks that could compete and have the size and access to
cheaper foreign exchange funding as well as trade finance capabilities are
Raiffeisen, Ukrsib, Credit Agricole and OTP accounting for 12.6% collectively.

Raiffeisen is engaged in dealing with the retail business and the work out of
their NPLs. However, its long-serving CEO Mr Lavrenchuk is rumoured to
become the Governor of NBU and the management team will be replaced with
expatriates from Raiffeisen’s head office. This move will create a major upset in
the bank’s structure and may result to a major change in strategy with a
considerable time to be needed for bringing the bank back to smooth operation.

Alfa who have bought over Unicredito’s Ukrsots bank (6.5% combined) and
who have historically being engaged in retail lending and large corporates
should continue to pursue this business and should devote resources to the
merger with Ukrsots and manage the business lending that should take some
time to grasp. Rumours say that they will initiate the merger process in not less
than a year and already they have discontinued new business lending servicing
existing customers only.

FUIB have been given a plan to recapitalise the bank or decrease their assets
and therefore they are out of the business for the time being.

ING and Citi are providing large corporate and investment banking services
only.
