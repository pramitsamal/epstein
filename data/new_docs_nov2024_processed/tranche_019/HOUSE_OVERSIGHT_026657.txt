screening people trying to go inside.

Several lawyers offered a preview of their defense strategy during the hearing, arguing that the rioting charge
should be dismissed because prosecutors hadn’t shown that each defendant was specifically involved in the
rioting described in charging documents. Although the defendants were brought out in groups before the judge,
they’re individually charged.

One lawyer argued that the US attorney’s office should recuse from prosecuting the cases because the
defendants were charged with participating in anti-Trump riots and Trump was now in charge of the US
Department of Justice.

“T appreciate all the creative arguments,” Magistrate Judge Rainey Brandt said in response, but she said that at
this early stage of the case she only had to find that the government had shown probable cause to move the
cases forward.

The defendants are due back in court on various dates in February and March.

Officials in the nation’s capital are throwing the book at anti-Trump protesters —threatening the people who

were arrested <http://nypost.com/2017/01/20/dozens-arrested-as-anti-trump-protesters-clash-with-police/> with
massive fines and up to 10 years in jail.

The U.S. attorney’s office will seek to charge all 230 of the protesters who took to the streets on Inauguration
Day — some damaging storefronts and clashing with police — with felony rioting.

As of Saturday evening, 80 people had already been slapped with the heavy charges, which include fines of up
to $25,000 and up to 10 years in jail, according to
