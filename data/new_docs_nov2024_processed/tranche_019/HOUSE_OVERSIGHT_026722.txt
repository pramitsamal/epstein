Central banks are seeking external assistance in
building internal capability as well as for investment
strategy and execution

Central bank decisions on the allocation and risk
profile of the investment tranche allocations are
generally made internally. Reserves managers

are seeking wider assistance in building internal
investment frameworks to support their growing
appetite for risk asset exposure, whether through
asset management mandates or collaboration with
academic and multi-lateral institutions such as the
World Bank. Central banks will continue to look to
external managers for their technical advisory and
systems support (figure 34), as sovereigns have done
over many years.

While 87% of central bank respondents use an
asset manager within their entire reserves portfolio,
there is less usage when building the first investment
tranche (figure 35). This reflects a bias to first develop
internal capacity before outsourcing to external asset
managers for alpha generation and expansion into
new asset classes. Central banks are reluctant to
convert relationships into ongoing mandates until
they have developed the capacity to oversee the risks
incurred by external asset managers. Those that
elect to allocate assets to external managers include
requirements to continue supporting central banks in
developing their own internal management capability.
External managers must be patient and offer real
value through transfer of experience, processes
and technology, and must then have a sufficiently
compelling value proposition to sustain a long-term
commercial relationship.
