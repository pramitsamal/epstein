RLK: But behind the scenes, I
talked to economists, the leading
economists officials, every day.
Everybody wants a solution and
they want it a lot sooner than 20
years. But number one, they have
to have a government in
Washington that are people they
can talk to, that they will have
confidence that what they say will
be implemented. And the Chinese
want a solution because many of
the problems, if we look at the
problems, solutions are consonant
with what China needs itself,
opening up markets further is one
of them.

RLK: Economists tell me all the time
that China needs to open markets.
That more competitiveness within
China — that’s good for China, but
they can't look like they're
subservient or bowing to foreign
pressures. We can go through each
of the issues that are critical: China
has made progress in intellectual
property. Is it perfect? Of course
not, but they know they really need
to improve that. They will reduce
forced technology transfer.
