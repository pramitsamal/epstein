Of course, none of the supportive factors discussed above precludes further bouts of equity volatility.
As we highlighted at the beginning of the year, the historical probability of a 5% or greater correction
from current valuation levels was 96%. Yet these statistics alone do not justify underweighting
equities, since such pullbacks often occur after sizable equity rallies, as this year reminds us.

Moreover, such pullbacks are quite normal historically. After all, stocks have suffered a median of two
pullbacks of at least 5% and one of at least 10% per calendar year in the post-WWII period, leaving
both the frequency and magnitude of this year’s dips in line with past experience. Most importantly,
years that experienced a similar number of pullbacks as 2018 nonetheless ended with a median gain
of 6% and had 77% odds of a positive return.

Conclusion

Although we have painted a less alarmist view of recent market weakness, we are by no means
Pollyannaish. While bull markets do not die of old age, they do become more susceptible to ailments
over time. Yet as we survey the tug of war between the steady factors and the unsteady undertow,
we do not think the balance of risks is strong enough to topple the ongoing US expansion and the
continued growth of corporate earnings it supports.

That said, this viewpoint does not preclude further market volatility and the market may still make new
lows if the current downdraft persists. But history suggests the bull market is likely to continue until
about 5-6 months prior to the end of this economic expansion. Thus, it will take a significant increase
in the odds of an imminent recession to provide the trigger—that has been lacking thus far—to
tactically underweight equities. In the interim, we continue to recommend that clients maintain their
strategic allocation to US equities.
