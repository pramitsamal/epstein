e History will surely record your immeasurable
contribution to the strength of Israel, and the
maintenance of the truly special relationship
between our peoples.

e On behalf of the people of Israel, | wish
Secretary Hagel all the best in his new role.

e As Secretary of Defense he will, no doubt, serve
his country with the same pride and honor
with which he served, both on the battlefield
and in Congress.

e It is great to see so many young activists here.
Thank you for your energetic commitment to
Israel!

e Acommitment which is so lucidly dictated by
the head... yet so deeply underpinned by the
heart...

e Keep it up — you are the future!
