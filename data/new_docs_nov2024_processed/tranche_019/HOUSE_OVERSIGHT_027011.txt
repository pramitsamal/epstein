It is thanks to the rock solid US-lsrael
relationship, alongside the devotion of the
young men and women of the IDF, that our
Capacity to defend ourselves, has been
guaranteed for years to come!

With US support, combined with the ingenuity
of our scientists; Israel finds itself at the cutting
edge of missile defense technology.

The ‘Iron Dome’ recently intercepted over 400
incoming terrorist rockets. Practically — this is
like hitting a bullet... with a bullet!

Just last week, we — the US and Israel —
conducted a successful exo-atmospheric test of
the Arrow 3 interceptor.

The State of Israel simply would not be the
strong island of stability it is, without one
crucial constant.

You! The United States of America. Its people.
Its leadership. Its Congress. Its Jewish
community.
