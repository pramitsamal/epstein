strategy. At Frieze. the celebrity-soaked | 1

autumn London art fair. the developer
Oakmayne Bespoke held an exhibition
— The House of the Nobleman— in one
of the grand London town houses that it
has for sale.

The result? Significant interest in the
two properties — offers of £29 million
and £39 million —- with another to go on
ithe market next year, along with the sale
of six major artworks. |

The properties in Cornwall Terrace |
overlook Regent's Park, where the fair is
held. Frieze was attended by the world’s |
wealthiest collectors, the highest-profile
dealers, including Jay Jopling, curators
for the top museums and art enthusiasts
« suchas Claudia Schiffer, Gwyneth
Paltrow and Lily Allen.

The exhibition, held in conection with |
the Saatchi Gallery, was curatedbytwo |
Russians, Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and |
Victoria Golembiovskaya. Mirax, the |
Russian property firm owned by Sergei
Polonsky, has a stake in the Cornwall
Terrace project. Works by Cézanrie,
Picasso, Andy Warhol, Tracey Emin.and
Damien Hirsi were among those on show
in the staircases, bathrooms and attics of
the house. James Simpson, a partner at
Knight Frank, says: “The interplay
between luxury art and property sales has
always existed, but it’s only now, starting
with Cornwall Terrace, that we are
formally doing launches and activities»
that bring together the two.”

Beth Dean, the sales and marketing
director at Oakmayne, agrees: “Even at
this top end of the property market, sales
need to be ‘worked’ [tis no longer
enough to do a basic stand-alone launch
with a residential product. You need to.do
something unique, stylish and very
® special to differentiate your brand.”

Simpson says that there are more
Damien Hirst works in the residences
surrounding Regent's Park than in any
other London location: “The marriage of t
the classic Regency properties and }
contemporary art works really well.”

ice THE TIMES Friday October 29 2010

: Anyone looking to pick up more
| modestly priced works of art may
: encounter an obstacle — a snooty

gallery owner questioning you about

: what pieces you already own, However,

you can avoid such terrifying scenarios
by buying online. Culture Label recently
opened an online art shop, with work
from.550 artists costing between £100
and £2,000. The shop is a collaboration
with Own Art, an Arts Council
initiative, through which you can pay in
interest-free instalments.

Meanwhile, the website easyart.com,
which tailors its artworks to buyers
with interior decoration in mind, has
launched an iPhone app that lets you
test 50,000 prints, in different frames,
ina picture of the room that you wish
to decorate.

Nol everyone recommends buying
online, however, as we discovered by
asking top interior designers for their
tips on purchasing art for yourhome.

Joanna Wood, head of the eponymous
loxury interior design firm, firmly
states that buying online is never a good
idea for original artworks. “For a series
of prints that you have seen before,
online could be an option. But don't buy
an original painting from a website
because so much of it is about texture.

| feel'and perspective.”

Wood shops for works in the streets

' off Piccadilly, but also recommends

the Art London fair for affordable

| pieces, as does Anita Kohn, of the

architectural firm Living in Space,
who also loves the Affordable Art Fair.
“The atmosphere is buzzy, the gallerists

! are friendly and no piece costs more

than £3,000,” she says. “1 used to buy
randomly, but now I am more focused
and collect works on paper — Old
Master drawings or Impressionist
works, often from sale rooms.”
Kamini Ezralow, of the international

: design company Intarya, recommends

scouring markets and galleries when
travelling to pick up local art and craft
pieces: “If you see a work in a gallery
that you like closer to home, go back
and ask to see more by the same artist.
You can then build a relationship with
that gallerist and use them as a regular
source for pieces that suit your taste and

: price capacity.”

Kohn recommends starting with

: prints and advises shopping with an

open mind “so that you don't buy
something purely because it fits with

: your self-imposed criteria. The vital
: thing is to buy something that you love,
| because you will be looking at it every

ingle day”.
