a€ stories that have gone unheard, or unspoken, because they involve women whose

xperiences were complicated 4€ is incalculable. Why didna€™t I report? Because I was
drunk; because I dond€™t remember perfectly; because I didnde™t yell long enough;
because no one would believe me; becaus veryone would think it was my fault; because

I thought it was my fault; because I had less power. This is what has foregrounded the
fundamental inexpressibility of so much of the full human experience for so many women,
even in this era in which we have so often been told that one yeard€™s worth of stories
about the ubiquity of assault and harassment amounts to an
overcorrection.,type:text}, {identifier: anf-body-
