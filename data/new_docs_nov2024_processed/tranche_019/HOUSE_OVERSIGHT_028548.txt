6 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.

Opinion of the Court

They claimed that pollution from the plant, such as coal
dust, ash, and water from the plant’s cooling system, had
destroyed or contaminated much of the surrounding air,
land, and water. Relying on the audit report, they asserted
several causes of action against the IFC, including negli-
gence, nuisance, trespass, and breach of contract. The
IFC maintained that it was immune from suit under the
IOIA and moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction.

The District Court, applying D.C. Circuit precedent,
concluded that the IFC was immune from suit because the
IOIA grants international organizations the virtually
absolute immunity that foreign governments enjoyed
when the IOJA was enacted. 172 F. Supp. 3d 104, 108—
109 (DC 2016) (citing Atkinson v. Inter-American Devel-
opment Bank, 156 F. 8d 1885 (CADC 1998)). The D.C.
Circuit affirmed in light of its precedent. 860 F. 8d 708
(2017). Judge Pillard wrote separately to say that she
would have decided the question differently were she
writing on a clean slate. /d., at 708 (concurring opinion).
Judge Pillard explained that she thought the D. C. Circuit
“took a wrong turn” when it “read the IOIA to grant inter-
national organizations a static, absolute immunity that is,
by now, not at all the same ‘as is enjoyed by foreign gov-
ernments, but substantially broader.” /bid. Judge Pillard
also noted that the Third Circuit had expressly declined to
follow the D. C. Circuit’s approach. See OSS Nokalva, Inc.
v. European Space Agency, 617 F. 3d 756 (CA3 2010).

We granted certiorari. 584 U.S.__ (2018).

II

The IFC contends that the IOTA grants international
organizations the “same immunity” from suit that foreign
governments enjoyed in 1945. Petitioners argue that. it
instead grants international organizations the “same
immunity” from suit that foreign governments enjoy to-
