16 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.

BREYER, J., dissenting

Were we to interpret the statute statically, then, the
default rule would be immunity in suits arising from an
organization’s commercial activities. But the Executive
Branch would have the power to withdraw immunity
where immunity is not warranted, as the Act itself pro-
vides. And in making that determination, it could con-
sider whether allowing the lawsuit would jeopardize the
organization’s ability to carry out its public interest tasks.
In a word, the Executive Branch, under a static interpre-
tation, would have the authority needed to separate law-
suit sheep from lawsuit goats.

Under the majority’s interpretation, by contrast, there is
no such flexibility. The Executive does not have the power
to tailor immunity by taking into account the risk of a
lawsuit’s unjustified interference with institutional objec-
tives or other institutional needs. Rather, the majority’s
holding takes away an international organization’s im-
munity (in cases arising from “commercial” activities)
across the board. And without a new statute, there is no
way to restore it, in whole or in part. Nothing in the
present statute gives the Executive, the courts, or the
organization the power to restore immunity, or to tailor
any resulting potential liability, where a lawsuit threatens
seriously to interfere with an organization’s legitimate
needs and goals.

Thus, the static interpretation comes equipped with
flexibility. It comes equipped with a means to withdraw
immunity where justified. But the dynamic interpretation
freezes potential liability into law. It withdraws immunity
automatically and irretrievably, irrespective of institu-
tional harm. It seems highly unlikely that Congress
would have wanted this result.
