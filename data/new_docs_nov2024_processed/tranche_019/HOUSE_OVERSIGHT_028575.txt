BREYER, J., dissenting

tion as one way both to diminish the risk of conflict and to
promote economic development and commercial prosper-
ity. Congress at that time and at the request of many of
those organizations enacted the Immunities Act. Given
the differences between international organizations and
nation states, along with the Act’s purposes and the risk of
untoward consequences, I would leave the Immunities Act
where we found it—as providing for immunity in both
commercial and noncommercial suits.

My decision rests primarily not upon linguistic analysis,
but upon basic statutory purposes. Linguistic methods
alone, however artfully employed, too often can be used to
justify opposite conclusions. Purposes, derived from con-
text, informed by history, and tested by recognition of
related consequences, will more often lead us to legally
sound, workable interpretations—as they have consistently
done in the past. These methods of interpretation can
help voters hold officials accountable for their decisions
and permit citizens of our diverse democracy to live to-
gether productively and in peace—basic objectives in
America of the rule of law itself.

With respect, I dissent.
