Financial Plan

Forecast
Key Assumptions
The financial plan relies on certain underlying assumptions;

e¢ A gradual start since we are gathering potential customers.

e The technology is not very common, therefore, educating potential clients and
the public will require some time.

e Weare expecting steady growth once the accuracy of the platform has been
demonstrated.

¢ The technology is new and updated so there's only a minimal chance that the
product immediately obsoletes.

According to the assumptions and the timeline we have predicted, our first sales will be
after six months. From each brand/retailer, we have assumed to earn a revenue of
$25,000 to $30,000 per year. Additional revenue will be received through providing
consulting services to clients, especially government sectors and political parties.

In our first three years, we are projecting $400,000 in Year 1, $850,000 in Year 2 and
$1.6 million in Year 3 in revenue with a 100% profit margin. We expect PR and
Marketing to be our top expense. The first 2 years’ payroll costs will be minimal as
founding members are not taking any salary for that period of time.
