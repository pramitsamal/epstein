agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I’m gaining the platform and the
name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building literacy and
character in the schools.

It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it’s always annoying but | always learn.

With abundant gratitude,
Lisa
