* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un of Wisconsin-
Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory.

* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my
expertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you

need to tell me if you would like to include this.

* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability in biomedical
and especially psychological research - the scandal in recent years. See links and attachments.

* Other possibile areas you suggest

We would like to set a mutually agreed schedule so we can confirm and reserve the Closer To Truth ‘season’
of 13 episodes for 'Radical Breakthroughs’, which we need to plan well in advance - especially as we begin
2018.

See you Jan. 5 - Looking forward to brainstorming.
