* Other possibile areas you suggest

We would like to set a mutually agreed schedule so we can confirm and reserve the Closer To Truth ‘season’
of 13 episodes for 'Radical Breakthroughs’, which we need to plan well in advance - especially as we begin
2018.

See you Jan. 5 - Looking forward to brainstorming.

Love your feedback, suggestions.

Also attached is the budget and timing of funding, as presented originally, now updated for the completion of
preproduction (phase I). We are ready to go into production (phase IT). See Budget, p. 4. Committed and
excited.
