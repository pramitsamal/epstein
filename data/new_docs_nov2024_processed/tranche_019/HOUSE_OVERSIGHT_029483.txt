Communications

TCMIH will staff a 24 hour a day dispatch center with dispatchers who are professional, caring
and multi-task oriented. They will be responsible for making sure all requests for service are
handled in a prompt and courteous manner. The dispatchers handle and maintain all internal and
external communication between TCMIH and those agencies requesting ambulance transportation.
They are responsible for accepting, coordinating, and screening all requests for service and will
remain in radio contact with the crew from start to finish in each transport.

Equipment

As a private Non- profit service organization, a significant portion of our capital will be utilized in
the purchase of equipment. Our equipment selection will be based upon the latest advances in the
ambulance industry.

Ambulance

Currently we have one unit serving St. Croix with future operational plans to staff four Quick
Response Vehicles, and four additional ALS ambulances typically Type III models allowing for
additional room for complex equipment and staffing needs for more critical patients. Our
expansion intent will cover all of the USVI to include St. Thomas and St. John.

EPCR

To safeguard patient care documentation and best comply with the continuing regulations set forth
by Medicare/Medicaid for comprehensive medical necessity documentation TCMIH will be using
electronic run reports documentation.

Quality Assurance

In the dictionary the word Quality is defined as “an inherent or distinguishing characteristic; or a
degree or grade of excellence”.
