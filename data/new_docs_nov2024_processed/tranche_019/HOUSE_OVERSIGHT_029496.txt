1.5 Summary

With your donation of $10,000,000.00, Twin City commits to aggressively expand during the
next three (3) years of operation. The intentions are to purchase an operations facility, set up a
mental health crisis hotline, purchase additional equipment and hire additional personnel. We
also intend to implement marketing campaigns that will effectively target individual new
customers within the territory. Due to our unique inside and immediate access to the market in
which we are involved with, on a daily basis, we will be able to assist and provide guidance to
the needs of our patients, constituents and future customers.
