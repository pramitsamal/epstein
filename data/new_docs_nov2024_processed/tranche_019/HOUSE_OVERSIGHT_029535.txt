Hi,
Would be great if Lisa could visit us. She sounds like the right person to help us get organized.

Maldives just got elected Vice President of International Renewable Energy Agency. We are also Vice Chair
of the UN Human Rights Council. Not too bad considering we had so much bad coverage this year
internationally.

Best regards,

Waheed

Hi,
The campaign team is starting to come together. We are continuing discussions with Jim and tomorrow
we will meet him face to face on skype. We will brief him on the situation here so that he will be able to

advice us more effectively. Already he has sent some very useful suggestions and we are working on them.

Getting the right people to head various aspects on the campaign is difficult here but we should be able to
pull the team together shortly.

We will need some more help from lan and Rory because we are still weak on international

communication. Some old negative stuff keeps coming up in the Guardian newspaper in England. But most
of the international media is not paying much attention to Maldives right now.
