nothing about what Iranian decision-
makers think about nuclear weapons or
deterrence theory. Since the Iranian
revolution in 1979, opportunities for the
exchange of professional views between
Western and Iranian scholars,
policymakers, and military leaders on
these critically important issues have
been extremely limited. Therefore, it's not

like American policymakers in the early
stages of developing their nuclear triad
doctrine, will think of nuclear weapons as
merely big artillery. Unfortunately, the
United States and its security partners
lack formal and informal exchanges with
the Iranians akin to the Cold War
discussions and arms control negotiations
between the Americans and Soviets,
which allowed both parties to develop
mutual understandings of the other's
perception of nuclear weapons. These
understandings were essential for crisis
management in the Cold War strategic
relationship after the Cuban missile
crisis.

Meanwhile, the Gulf states, led by Saudi
Arabia, are likely to look for their own
nuclear deterrents. Much like France

want their own nuclear weapons to deter
Iran. Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf
