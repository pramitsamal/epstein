Democracy’s Dawn in Tunisia and
Egypt?

Alfred Stepan

2011-05-12 -- CAIRO — With protests fading in Tunis and seeming
to have peaked in Cairo, it is time to ask whether Tunisia and Egypt
will complete democratic transitions. I have been visiting both
countries, where many democratic activists have been comparing
their situation with the more than 20 successful and failed democratic-
transition attempts throughout the world that I have observed and
analyzed.

One fear should be dismissed immediately: despite worries about the
incompatibility of Islam and democracy, more than 500 million
Muslims now live in Muslim-majority countries that are commonly
classified as democracies — Indonesia, Turkey, Bangladesh, Senegal,
Mali, and Albania. But, for almost 40 years, not a single Arab-
majority country has been classified as a democracy, so a democratic
transition in either Tunisia or Egypt (or elsewhere in the region)
would be of immense importance for the entire Arab world.
Tunisia’s chances of becoming a democracy before the year ends are,
I believe, surprisingly good. A key factor here is that the military is
not complicating the transition to democracy. Tunisia has a small
military (only about 36,000 soldiers), and, since independence in
1956, it had been led by two party-based non-democratic leaders who
strove to keep the military out of politics.

Moreover, the current civilian-led interim government engages in at
least some negotiations about the new democratic rules of the game
