Jordan also fell in the rankings of the highly respected Transparency
International Corruptions Perceptions Index from 37 (1 being the
least corrupt in about 180 countries studied) in 2003 to 50 in 2010. It

reform and, in most cases, took measures that set the process back.
The uprisings that Jordan is A Decade of Struggling Reform Efforts

the state may move away from such a system. The king's own policies
on political reform-often aimed at striking a balance between the
traditional elements and the reformers-have not borne fruit, and
almost always resulted in appeasing traditional elements at the
expense of reform. Reform needs reformers who are cognizant of the
need for an orderly, gradual process but are also committed to a
serious roadmap that would lead to true power-sharing through
strong legislative and judicial bodies. The selection of several prime
ministers did not lead to serious progress on reform, precisely
because they were neither true believers in its value, nor did they
have a critical mass of reformers inside their governments able to
counterbalance the traditional elements who wanted to preserve the
status quo at all costs. Thus, instead of holistically addressing all
needed areas of reform, reform programs were instead reduced to ad-
hoc initiatives that did not add up to any serious and structural
changes in governance systems. The king's practice of handing a
prime minister a plan for reform that the latter does not believe in and
expecting him to deliver on it regardless has simply failed. The
National Agenda, an example of such a holistic and gradual program
to move toward a more inclusive and democratic system, was never
