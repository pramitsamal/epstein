FYI — our vendor is creating a transcript from the audio recording, so I'll send that around when it’s ready.

Will, if you’re concerned that people might want to slice it up, then we likely should not go with the FTP site
(option A), because the link would not be protected and someone could find it. Posting on Steptoe’s YouTube
channel (option B) with secured settings would make the link only accessible to those who receive the link. It
would also provide reporters with a faster way to view the video since they would not have to download

it. Does that make sense?

Thank you, Kathy. | think for now the FTP site is the right choice for getting it in the hands of reporters. We don’t want it
too accessible to people who might slice it up, and a youtube link would travel faster, | believe. We eventually want to
trim the video into chunks and post on YouTube through AFSV’s channels.
