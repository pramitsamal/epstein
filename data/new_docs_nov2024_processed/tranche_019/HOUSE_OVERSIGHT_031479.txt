Subject: Audio recording

All,

| just received a copy of the audio recording with Q&A. The video recording will be available mid-to-late
afternoon. As the file will be too large to distribute via email, we have two posting options:

a) Upload to Steptoe’s FTP site, where the file is public but not (easily) discoverable to the casual Steptoe.com
browser or searcher. We would send reporters the link, at which point they would download the recording in
order to watch it.

B) Upload the file to Steptoe’s YouTube channel and set the security around the video so that it’s only
watchable by someone who has the link. It would not be discoverable by anyone who doesn’t have the exact
URL (searching or browsing). The advantage with this option is the reporters could watch the video via the
YouTube player, rather than downloading a file.

| believe our preference is the second choice?

Thanks,
Kathy
