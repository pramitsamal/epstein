Will, if you’re concerned that people might want to slice it up, then we likely should not go with the FTP site (option A),
because the link would not be protected and someone could find it. Posting on Steptoe’s YouTube channel (option B)
with secured settings would make the link only accessible to those who receive the link. It would also provide reporters
with a faster way to view the video since they would not have to download it. Does that make sense?

Thank you, Kathy. | think for now the FTP site is the right choice for getting it in the hands of reporters. We don’t want it
too accessible to people who might slice it up, and a youtube link would travel faster, | believe. We eventually want to
trim the video into chunks and post on YouTube through AFSV’s channels.

All,

I just received a copy of the audio recording with Q&A. The video recording will be available mid-to-late afternoon. As
the file will be too large to distribute via email, we have two posting options:

a) Upload to Steptoe’s FTP site, where the file is public but not (easily) discoverable to the casual Steptoe.com browser or
searcher. We would send reporters the link, at which point they would download the recording in order to watch it.

B) Upload the file to Steptoe’s YouTube channel and set the security around the video so that it’s only watchable by
someone who has the link. It would not be discoverable by anyone who doesn’t have the exact URL (searching or
