That's a pretty clear answer. Thanks, you saved me a phone call. If you have any other ideas for top guys there, let
me know. Otherwise, | have a former FBI guy | might use. Going to be a very hard fought case. Take care, David

You might recall that we met by email and on the phone a couple of years ago, originally through our mutual friend
Bernard Kruger.

| have a question for you. | am preparing a lawsuit against the Broward County Sheriff's Department. | am looking for
a good and trustworthy private investigator there who will not undercut me with the Sheriff's department because of
ties there, etc. | have a couple of candidates; but someone recently referred me to one in Davie, FL who this person
said would fit the bill.

When | went on the guy's website, however, | see that one of the things he apparently holds out as a highlight (it is on
his press page) is a series of stories about your case. | assume the guy was an investigator for the other side in the
civil case - the group that set you up.

His name is Mike Fisten and his company is Blueline Investigations. If he is someone who you encountered and he
was a bad guy or out to get you, | would not want to use him. Even though we don't really know each other, | very
much liked you when we spoke and | would not want to give business to someone who had gone after you and you
think is a bad guy. If on the other hand, he was a decent guy just doing his job, perhaps it would be ok. | can't tell
enough about it from his website.
