European countries, and which we therefore can’t take for granted.
So, as you see, the normative concern is separate from the empirical
question of whether democracy is inevitable.

SHAFFER: Origins incorporates economics, anthropology,
philosophy, and social psychology, for lessons about political order.
Is that kind of study too rare today?

FUKUYAMA: This ts partly the fault of the structure of academia.
There’s such a premium placed on specialization and narrowness that
it’s very hard to think more broadly and to cross disciplinary
boundaries. I work at Stanford in an interdisciplinary institute, and
I’ve been associated with these kinds of outfits for most of my years.
And those are where the most interesting research gets done.

SHAFFER: What field outside of political science has the most
important insights for understanding political order?

FUKUYAMA: That’s hard to say. I don’t know if there is one. Part
of the problem is economics — it’s a very important discipline, but in
a way it’s colonized the rest of the social sciences. A lot of political
analysis in academia is driven by this model of everybody being a
rational decision maker driven by more or less material interests.
There’s obviously something to that, but it’s a very limited way of
looking about politics, which is about dignity and values and ideas
that can’t be explained in material terms. Other disciplines —
sociology and anthropology — have gotten at those things better than
economics has.
