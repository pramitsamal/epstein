rather than blood and revenge. However thers Is ,
in my opnion n o way to achieve but to move
forward with the Palestinians

A precondition to seize such an opportunity is a
mighty, sober, self confident Israel, in strong
alliance with the US. An Israel which can deter or
defeat any combination of regional powers, yet, an
Israel who is ready to contemplate and consider a
modified Saudi or Arab League Plan as a basis for
negotiations.

The unique relationship we have developed with
the US over the last 45yrs based on common
values ,mutual respect and shared interests is a
cornerstone of our strength, world posture and

our future. It is also a crucial building block of any
regional peace and cooperation strategy.Allowing
IL/US relations to remain damaged , | believe isa
grave mistake with potentially far reaching
consequences.

As the Minister of Defense of Israel I've met more
than once with President Obama , as well as with
President Bush before him, , reiterating with both
that the though the US is clearly our best friend
