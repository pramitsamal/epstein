Hi Jeffrey, Many options through Asia, destination New York , please let me know the dates, also it'll be
good to have an engeenier at the site to ask some technical (local) questions

With this plus your briefing, would be enough to asses the islands and through the two days of (blue sky
Ideas) get your vision in a rough format
