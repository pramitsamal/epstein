Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed.

Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, | will also need to have someone
keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be need for
some work on my side before final filing is done.

On the other hand, if there is a checks and balances control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent.

Please do let me know.

We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time)

In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.

There is Simm in the bank account. We can prepare checks or wires for you to sign upon request. This way
book keeping gets done at same time. Just send back up with each request. How does that sound?
