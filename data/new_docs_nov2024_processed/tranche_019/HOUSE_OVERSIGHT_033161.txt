director of the Palm Beach County Education Commission touted the area’s
benefits. I surveyed real estate and office space surrounded by miles of
water without once having my foot stepped on by a tourist. You can see how
all this might sway someone who’s on the fence.

Exploring the sugary beaches of South Florida, one starts to wonder why
Wall Streeters would be on the fence at all. Between the smiling locals and
the shopping on Worth Avenue, the Hiaasen-esque stereotypes recede.
What remains are the facts: Take-home pay is higher, commutes are
shorter, and it’s just as fabulous as Manhattan, at least for four months of
the year. Meanwhile, no one in Florida even owns an ice scraper. With the
Internet allowing more and more money managers to perform their work
from nearly anywhere, there are few reasons not to make the move.

“Initially, it was a way to play golf and keep the wife and kids happy,” says
Brett Langbert, managing director and head of sales at I.A. Englander & Co.
“But once we moved down, it became a quality-of-life issue. There are
unlimited things the kids can do outside. I have to tell you, my wife and I
are so happy we haven’t had to go to one of those indoor bouncy-castle
places since we got here.”
