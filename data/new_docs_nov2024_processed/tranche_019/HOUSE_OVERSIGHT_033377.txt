Unfortunately, bin Sulayem and I did not meet. I was stuck at the White House and he had a narrow window
before heading to Cyprus. I just sent him the following note:

Good Morning, I hope your travels to Cyprus were smooth.
Okey Enelamah, Nigeria's trade minister, stopped by my home this evening as he was still in town after
Buhari's visit with Trump. He mentioned his discussions with you at WEF and afterwards. Separately, I

spoke earlier with the Vice President.

Whenever we meet, I have some thoughts that may be helpful to you.
