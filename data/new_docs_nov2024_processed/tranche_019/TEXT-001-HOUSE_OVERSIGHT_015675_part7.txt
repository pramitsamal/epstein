Puzzles and
Experiments
In this book I have suggested some experiments for you to undertake,
and posed some puzzles to solve. You can participate in the
experiments or see the answers by going online and checking my
website at www.jamestagg.com
Jeopardy Answers from Chapter 1.
Answer 1. Watson answered, Gestate.
Answer 2. Watson answered. Who is Bram Stoker.
Answer 3. The answer is Chicago but Watson answered
“Toronto?????”, the question marks indicating it was
very doubtful of the answer.

How to Write Good
“Defining what we mean by
a robot is hard to do. I know

definition works for anything,

Mike Gregory
Appendix 4
Conventions in
the Book
The use of italics is intended to give accent or indicate the title of
the published work, such as a book or movie. Inverted Commas
should read, ‘so called’.
The use of the ‘Oxford Comma’ – a comma after ‘and’ – gives a
longer break in a sentence to aid better understanding. You will find both
‘and’ and, ‘and,’ used in this book deliberately.
The use of ‘their’ substitutes for he or she, and is a convention I
believe will supersede, ‘he’ or ‘she’ and, ‘him’ or ‘her’.
The puzzles in this book are all available to download, so you
don’t need to deface the book. Feel free to deface it if you wish. Buy the
electronic version and save trees.
Some of this book is historical or factual, while much is highly
speculative. I have tried to indicate where ideas are controversial and
where they are matters of accepted science. However, my experience is
that much of what you are taught tends to be a gross generalization or
even plain wrong. If you treat facts with a degree of skepticism, you will
find this keeps you in good stead.
As someone who is highly dyslexic, there will be errors. Please email
me the ones you find, and recommend the book to your friends so that I
can afford to print a second edition with your corrections.
I have avoided the use of equations and mathematics, so you
can see the flow of the philosophical argument. I also avoid a strongly
historical narrative, but if you enjoy the history of science I recommend,
The Missing 4%, and Quantum for a really clear exposé of the issues

around quantum mechanics, relativity and cosmology, Robert Winston’s
Bad Ideas for a more thorough history of language and writing, and The
Trouble with Physics for the recent history of particle Physics. Regarding
the brain, anything by Oliver Sachs is a winner. Your Brain on Music is a
good primer on the theory of artistic thought and music, and Proust and
the Squid is a good discussion of dyslexia and learning.
The digits for the sequence of the Smallpox virus in Chapter Eight
come from the varicella-zoster virus, a similar pathogen. The first few
letters could be the same, but I hope it is impossible for anyone to
disprove this as you would have to break into the CDC to do so.
John Masters is not the real name of the US officer who spoke in
Kabul. That name was never released to the press.
This book was originally written using Microsoft Word on a MacBook
Pro. It was then typeset for print using a variety of ePublication tools,

the links in the book should be maintained there just in case there is link
atrophy for the printed version of the book. Feel free to comment using

Appendix 5
Index of Theorems
I
have explained a number famous theorems in this book along with
some ideas of my own. Here is a list of the most notable.
1. Mind over Computer
Turing Test – How to tell whether a computer is intelligent, even
though we cannot agree on a definition of intelligence.
Flynn Effect – The observation that human intelligence appears
to be improving over time.
Kurzweil Singularity Proposal – The conjecture that Moore’s
Law will result in computers acquiring near infinite power
relatively soon.
Lucas Argument – Minds are in a different class to computers as
they are not limited by the incompleteness theorem.
Humor Hypothesis† – Humor and jokes are a display of noncomputable
intelligence.
2. Understanding
Tufte’s Assertion – That communication of understanding
exceeds the capability of many presentation tools, particularly
PowerPoint.
Chinese Room – John Searle’s paradox challenging the idea that
understanding can be mechanically simulated.
402 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?
3. Body Language & Banter
Communication Hypothesis† – That face to face communication
is more powerful in some real physical sense than symbolic
communication.
7-38-55 Rule – Mehrabian’s observation that the emotional
content of communication is 7% words, 38% tone of voice and
55% body language.
4. The Brain
Penrose-Hameroff Conjecture – Brains are quantum-gravity
computers using tubulin as the mediator.
5. Knowledge
Information Continuum Hypothesis† – Information is finite,
but understanding and knowledge are different in nature.
Infinite Monkeys Hypothesis – The paradox that says monkeys
could type Hamlet given enough time and paper.
Cat Experiment† – Finding my house cat can use our computer,
and may be more creative than monkeys!
6. Kittens & Gorillas
Feynman Proof – A proof that uses the lack of an evolved
species within an evolutionary niche to disprove the existence of
something; in this case polywater.
The Infinity of Primes – Pythagoras’ proof there are an infinity
of prime numbers without needing the concept of a number.
7. Complexity & Chaos
The Butterfly Effect – The proposal by Edward Lorenz that tiny
effects can multiply up into enormous results.
P≠NP – That non-deterministic polynomial problems can never
be solved in polynomial time and are, therefore, beyond the
capability of any imagined computer.
The Hawking-Bekenstein Turk† – Although there is a perfect
chess machine, it would collapse space-time to a black hole were
it to exist.
8. ∞
Continuum Hypothesis – Does anything come between the
first two infinities; counting numbers and the continuum of real
numbers.
Index of Theorems
403
Cantor’s First Infinity Theorem – The infinite plane is the same
infinity as the infinite line.
9. Known Unknowns
Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem – Mathematics involving
simple logic is incomplete.
Gödel’s Completeness Theorem – First order logic is complete.
Hilbert’s Completeness Theorem – Geometry is complete.
10. Turing’s Machines
Entscheidungsproblem – The decision problem has no solution.
Turing Thesis – All computers, once sufficiently powerful, are
equally powerful.
Non-Computability of Music† – That general musical
compositions are non-computable.
Non-Computability of Creativity† – That general artistic
creativity is non-computable.
11. Software
Brooks’ Law – Adding resource to a late project makes it later.
Law of Leaky Abstractions – However good the attempt to
abstract complexity, complexity has a habit of leaking through.
Software is Created† – writing software is a non-computable,
creative task.
Bug Hypothesis† – Bugs are an inevitable consequence of trying
to generalize software by mechanical means.
12. Hyper-Computing
Adaptive Recurrent Neural Network Hypothesis – Hava
Siegelmann’s proposal that ARNNs are capable of super-Turing
computation.
13. Hyper-Communication
Bandwidth Conjecture† – Person-to-person communication
has infinite bandwidth and is non-symbolic.
14. Creativity
Creativity Hypothesis† – That all creative endeavor is a noncomputable
skill, analogue to theorem discovery.
Wallas Model – A conceptual model for the way humans think
creatively.
404 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?
Creative Survival Advantage† – That creativity has evolved to
give us a survival advantage at all stages of evolution, not just when
we evolve to the point where mathematical intuition is significant.
15. Free Will
Laplace Daemon – A conceptual supreme being able to infer
the future and the past from one snapshot of space-time and the
laws of nature.
EPR Paradox – Twin particles would transmit information
faster than the speed of light if quantum mechanics was to be
believed.
Schrödinger’s Cat – The paradox that a cat might be both alive
and dead at the same time until observed.
Bell Inequality – Quantum mechanics forbids local hidden
variables in a testable way. The test succeeds.
Kochen-Specker Paradox – Particles cannot know their settings
before measurement.
Free Will Theorem – Nothing in the past light cone of the
Universe causes a particle to choose its spin upon measurement.
Non-decryptable Universe† – The laws of physics mean the
Universe is non-computable in principle.
Free Will Universe† – The laws of mathematics mean the
Universe is non-computable and therefore has Free Will.
Russian Doll Conjecture† – Since humans are creative and
non-deterministic and, in a sense, they run upon the hardware
of the Universe, the hardware of our Universe must also be nondeterministic.
16. The Quest for Knowledge
Technology Hypothesis† – The extended strong anthropic
principle that the Universe must have creative beings within it
to uniquely define it.
17. The Future
Creative Non-Singularity† – The future is non-computable and
therefore any increase in computer power, however great, will
never achieve a creativity singularity.

book. If I have missed a previous publication, please feel free to
