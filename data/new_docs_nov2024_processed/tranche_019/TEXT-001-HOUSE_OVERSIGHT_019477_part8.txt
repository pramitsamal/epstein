shadow government of the Conservative Party. He resigned from the shadow
government in June 2008, more than a year before the Zazi arrest. In any case,

and does not claim to have had, access to it.

a note on the type
The text of this book was set in a typeface called Aldus, designed by
the celebrated typographer Hermann Zapf in 1952– 53. Based on
the classical proportion of the popular Palatino type family, Aldus
was originally adapted for Linotype composition as a slightly
lighter version that would read better in smaller sizes.
Hermann Zapf was born in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1918. He
has created many other well known typefaces including Comenius,
Hunt Roman, Marconi, Melior, Michelangelo, Optima, Saphir, Sistina,
Zapf Book and Zapf Chancery.
