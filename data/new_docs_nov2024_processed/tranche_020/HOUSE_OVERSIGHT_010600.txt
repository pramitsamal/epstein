Epstein’s Harassment of Witnesses Against Him

82. At all relevant times Edwards has a good faith basis to believe and did in fact
believe that Epstein engaged in threatening witnesses. See Incident Report, Exhibit “A” at p. 82,
USS. Attorney’s Correspondence, Exhibit “C” - Indictments drafted by Federal Government
against Epstein; and Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at 11.

83. Despite three no contact orders entered against Epstein (see Exhibit C, supra),
Edwards learned that Epstein continued to harass his victims. For example, Jane Doe had a trial
set for her civil case against him on July 19, 2010. As that trial date approached, defendant
Epstein intimidated her in violation of the judicial no-contact orders. On July 1, 2010, he had a
“private investigator” tail Jane Doe — following her every move, stopping when she stopped,
driving when she drove, refusing to pass when she pulled over. When Jane Doe ultimately drove
to her home, the “private investigator” then parked in his car approximately 25 feet from Jane
Doe house and flashed his high beam lights intermittently into the home. Even more
threateningly, at about 10:30 p.m., when Jane Doe fled her home in the company of a retired
police officer employed by Jane Doe’s counsel, the “private investigator” attempted to follow
Jane Doe despite a request not to do so. The retired officer successfully took evasive action and
placed Jane Doe in a secure, undisclosed location that night. Other harassing actions against
Jane Doe also followed. See Motion for Contempt filed by Edwards in Jane Doe v. Epstein
detailing the event, including Fisten Affidavit attached to Motion, Composite Exhibit “RR.”
