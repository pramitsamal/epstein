supports that allegation.

A. Okay. The privileged information, obviously,
you're asking me not to reveal at this point.

Q. I'm asking you -- I'm asking you to tell me
the nonprivileged information. And I'm not agreeing
with your privilege assertion --

A. Sure.

Q._—-- but for purposes of this question --

A. For purposes of this question.

QQ. -- I'm accepting it.

A. All right.

Q. Putting aside what you claim is privileged, I
want to know everything that's the factual basis for
including the allegation about other minors.

A. Okay. Privileged information which I'm not
disclosing in any way would have interacted with a vast
body of other information.

The vast body of other information would have
started with an 89-page police report from the Palm
Beach Police Department that showed for about a
six-month period in 2005, there was sexual abuse of
minor girls going on on a daily basis, in -- whenever
Jeffrey Epstein was in his Paim Beach mansion.

And on some cases, it was going on not once,
not twice, but three times during the day. That -- let

me just be clear. I mean, I -- I referred to the
89-page police report. I have offered to put it into
the record if -- if it would speed things up, but let's
just talk about some of the things that are in that
89-page police report.

This was a -- a very intensive investigation
that the Palm Beach Police Department put together.
They did, for example, what are called trash covers;
that is when trash came out of the -- of the mansion of
Epstein, the police would intercept the trash and then
they would go through the trash and lock for
incriminating information.

And what they began to discover was memo
pads -- and I say memo pads, let's be clear, pad after
pad after pad, or I guess I should say, sheet after
sheet after sheet that had the name of a girl, and then
there was a notation of something to the effect of a
massage.

And so the Palm Beach Police Department began
tracking down, well, wait a minute, these -- these are
girls giving massages and they don't seem to have any
specialized training in massages; they don't seem to be
masseuses in any sense of the term; what's going on
here?

And so the Palm Beach Police Department

began, you know, I guess what we would call
knock-and-talks, knocking on doors to try to get to some
of these girls, and they would get to the girls, and
many of them initially were -- were afraid to explain
what had happened.

But as they -~- as they continued talking to
them, the girls began to explain that what was happening
was, they were going over to Epstein's house under the
guise of giving a massage, and when they got there, the
massage was, in fact, sexual activity.

And for many of the girls, I think, as I say
around 23, 24, something along those lines, they were
underage. They were under the age of consent in
Florida.

And so each and every one of those events was
a crime being perpetrated -- and let's be clear, not
just being perpetrated by Epstein, but by other people
who were involved there at the mansion.

And so what the -- the Palm Beach Police
Department was putting together was that this mansion in
Florida was the nest of sexual abuse of young girls here
in Florida that involved, literally, in the -- in this
period of time, more than a hundred events that they
were able to document of sexual abuse.

And when you put that together with the

ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400

68
pattern or practice that was being revealed there, there
were hundreds of acts of sexual abuse going on in the
mansion.

But then what becomes -- and this is where I
indicated that, you know, the answer would continue on,
The -- the problem was that the evidence was starting to
show that this was a much broader series of events. For
example, there were flight logs showing that Mr. Epstein
was then flying with underaged girls, and those flight
logs, you know, as -- as the flight logs began to
develop, for example, we have seen, I know in the last
day or two here, one underage girl was Virginia Roberts
who is on the flight, you know, with Epstein, and with
Maxwell, and those sorts of things.

So you start to look at the flight logs and
you see what's going on is not just events that are
occurring in Florida, but it's occurring ona
multi-state basis, which now starts to make it a federal
crime. For example, we are seeing evidence that --
let's just talk about Virginia Roberts since she's
central to this case.

We are seeing Virginia Roberts being flown
from Florida to New York where she's in the clutches of
Jeffrey Epstein who is sexually abusing her, you know,
many times a week. And not just Jeffrey Epstein, but
