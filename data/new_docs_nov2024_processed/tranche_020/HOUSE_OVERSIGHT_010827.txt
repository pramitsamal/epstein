other powerful persons. For example, Ghislaine Maxwell
is there with him on all of these flights and apparently
being involved in the abuse.

Indeed -- and so you -~ you have -- you
have that. You also start to see on the flight logs,
what to my mind are some very sinister things,
suggesting that the pattern is not just confined to sort
of, you know, the girls that are there in Florida, but
it -- it is extending more broadly.

Like one of the -- to my mind, sinister and
scary things on the flight logs is, we see, you know,
Virginia Roberts, who we know has been sexually abused,
and we see Jeffrey Epstein, and then we see on the
flight logs one female.

That's kind of an odd notation for a flight
log because, you know, typically, I understand the
flight logs, the purpose is, well, if something happens
with the flight, or there's some question about who was
on it, you want to know who -- who the person was who
was on the flight.

So, to my mind, when I started to see on
these flight logs entries like one female, I viewed that
as a potential device for obscuring the fact that there
was interstate trafficking of underage girls for
purposes of sexual activity. Serious federal offenses.

But then that evidence extended, you know,
more broadly than that. The evidence also started to
show, again, if we talk just about flight logs, that
the -- that underage girls such as Virginia Roberts were
being flown internationally from, for example, Teterboro
in New York to -- to locations, just to pick one, you
know, for example, in London, where again sexual abuse
was occurring.

And so you started to put together this
pattern of criminality that was started in this -- you
know, I don't know what the right word is here. I don’t
want to -- I don't want to -- you know, you've heard
discussions of hyperbole and things like that, but we
have got this nest of -- of -- and I won't say snakes,
but we have this nest of criminals in Florida, but it --
it seems to be spreading to Epstein's mansion in New
York; it seems to be spreading to Ghislaine Maxwell's
flat in London, and -- and -- and it goes on.

So those are the kinds of things that would
have formed the -- the -- the basis, particularly when
you -- when you start to add in this fact: What the
Palm -- going back now te Florida with the Palm Beach
Police Department. What the Palm Beach Police
Department has -- had discovered was not a one-off kind
of event, you know, on one particular day, one

particular girl had been sexually abused.

What the Palm Beach Police Department had
discovered was brazen, notorious, repetitive activity
sometimes occurring as often as three times ina
particular day. And so that led me to believe that the
sexual activity that was going on in Florida was such
that someone who was a regular house guest there would

have immediately come to the conclusion that, well,

look, gee, there are these underage girls coming in here

and they -- they seem to be -- you know, they don't seem
to be here to be doing, you know, business activities;
they ~- they might be here doing other kinds of
activities. So those would be the kinds of things that
would -- would have formed the factual basis.

There are other things as well, but I'm sure
you want to ask other questions in addition to that. So
I'll stop there, but those -- that's -- I think gives
you a small flavor of the kind of evidence that, you
know, was form -~ undergirding the allegations that were
being presented here.

Q. ‘It sounds like you quite passionately believe
that there was strong evidence that Mr. Epstein had
engaged in sexual misconduct; is that right?

A. I think strong understates it.

Q. In the course of that long answer, you didn't

mention Professor Dershowitz's name once.

A. I said flight logs. And let's talk about
flight logs.

Q. Let me back up. You didn’t answer his
name -- mention his name once; is that -- is that your
recollection as well?

A. That's correct. We were talking about a
factual basis, and I'll be glad -- I told you that there
were other things if you want, factual basis for -- for
Mr. Dershowitz. I'll be glad to add that in. Let me --
let's -- let me -- let me -- I would like to supplement
my answer then if I could.

Q. Do you want to look at a document?

A. Yes.

Q. Let me first -- have we exhausted your
recollection without documents of all the evidence that
you would refer to to support the allegation that
Professor Dershowitz abused other minors?

A. No.

MR. SCAROLA: And let me say that you have a
right to refer to whatever documents you choose
to refer to, to be sure that you give a complete
response to the question that has been asked, as
long as you understand that whatever you refer to
is going to be available to the other side, and
