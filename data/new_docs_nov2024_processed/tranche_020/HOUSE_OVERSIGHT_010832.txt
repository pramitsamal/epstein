oraoos 1 according to a -- to a later FBI report, Alessi

or407 2 identified information that was pertinent to the FBI's
ot4oo7 3 investigation.

orton 4 And so when I look at the little black book
onora 5 that I have seen copies of, there are a handful of names
ovo? 6 in that black book that have been circled, apparently by
oraoz22 7 Mr. Rodriguez, and one of the names that's -- that has
o4023 8 been circled is Alan Dershowitz. And so that, to me,
oraox0 9 was suggesting that Mr. Rodriguez had identified, you
oo3s 10 know, Alan Dershowitz as somebody who had information
ot4o3a 11 about this -- this international sex trafficking ring,

oraoao 12 But just as a side note, but an important

orsoaz 13 note, when the -- the thing that was circled on the Alan
oraoes 14 Dershowitz page was not a single phone number

ov4oz9 15 indicating, you know, somebody had bumped -- you know,
ovaost 16 Epstein had bumped into at one point. I believe there
ovoss 17 were 10 or 11 phone numbers that were associated with
o:4087 18 Mr. Dershowitz that had all been circled and an e-mail
o4i00 19 address as well.

orato2 20 So that started to corroborate my sense that
ota0s 21 Mr, Dershowitz was, indeed, a very close friend of

ovatto 22 Jeffrey Epstein. Now, I had then continued to do --
ovata 23 there's been reference today to, you know, using Google
oraine 24 todo research and so forth. So I Googled Jeffrey

onatas «6 2 And what you see in that article is, you

or4iz28 3 know, discussion about Mr. Epstein, but when you're
oratss | 4 trying to do a profile of someone, you try to figure out
oraiza «5 ~=who that person's closest friends are,

ovatas 6 And so the Vanity Fair author had gone to
oraiaa. «67)~©)— Alan Dershowitz, you know, our -- Mr. Dershowitz here,
oratcaa 8 and had asked him, hey, what do you know about Jeffrey
ois 9 Epstein?

oraias 10 And, again, off the top of my head, you want
o14ta7 11 to know what I can remember right now. What I can
ovataa 12 remember right now is that in the Vanity Fair article,
orats3 13 the -- in the Vanity Fair article, Mr. Dershowitz said,
oraiso 14 ‘I've written 20-some odd books; there's only one person
014203 15 outside my immediate family with whom I share drafts,
ovaz08 16 and that's Jeffrey Epstein.

oazt0 18 close personal association that -- you know, among the
o14213 19 people that -- that obviously he's sharing this -- these
oraz1s 20 kinds of things that he wants evaluated before he shares
ot4218 21 them with the broader world, there's his immediate
014221 22 family and then there's -- there's Jeffrey Epstein.

orar2s 23 There was also another similar quote in the
o14z24 24 article that indicated that -- that Mr. Dershowitz said
o14229 25 that he wasn't interested in Epstein just because he had

a lot of money. I mean, Epstein was identified as a
billionaire in this article, billionaire with -- with a
B, so the record is clear.

But he said, look, if Epstein lost all his
money -~ I'm paraphrasing here -- I would be, you know,
happy to walk down, you know, the Coney Island Boardwalk
with him and discuss things with him, as -- you know,
even if he didn't have any money.

So now I'm seeing Dershowitz is a very close
personal friend of Jeffrey Epstein. And then I started
to look at flight logs. There were -- there were some
very interesting things that I noticed on the flight
logs.

One of the things I noticed was when I began
to, you know, get into this, that, you know, I was
wondering, well, what -- well, how do these flight logs
come into the possession of, you know, law enforcement
agencies? And the answer turned out to be that they had
been provided by Epstein’s defense attorney and -~- and,
you know, coincidentally, I suppose, or in my mind,
suspiciously, they were not provided by just any defense
attorney on this rather large defense team. They were
provided by one attorney according to Detective Recarey.
Detective Recarey testified under oath that the flight
logs were provided to him by Alan Dershowitz.

So one of the things that was -- was
interesting is, Dershowitz has had access to these
flight logs, and now I'm beginning to wonder, well, has
there been an opportunity to sanitize those flight logs
or remove any incriminating information?

And -- and one of the things that was
interesting about the flight logs that were produced --

I believe just so the record is clear, that was Exhibit
1 that -- if we could -- if I could refer -- I need to
refresh my recollection as to -- well, I don't -~ you
may not want me to look at documents,

It was either Exhibit 1 or 2 this morning
during Dershowitz's deposition which was covering a time
period of January to, I believe, September 2005. These
were flight logs that were produced by Mr. Dershowitz to
the Palm Beach Police Department.

And you wonder why did they stop in
September -- you know, why stop in September 2005?
What's the significance of that? Well, later on,
additional flight logs were obtained, and sure enough,
who shows up on an October 2005 flight log with Jeffrey
Epstein? Mr. Dershowitz.

So that led to a suspicion that
Mr. Dershowitz had provided to the Palm Beach Police
Department flight logs that, the time period of which
