Summary

Creation of wealth, or equivalently of capital of either
factor.

Capital whose outside operating cost does not satisfy
tastes.

Capital of either value is expected cash flow discounted
at our time preference rate.

Output of physical capital.
Same as exhaust.

Quantity measured as a flow over a stock, and
equivalently as a pure number over time.

Quantity measured in dollars alone. Same as capital.
Intentions whose satisfaction terminates capital in
exhaust.

Output equals capital growth plus cash flow.

Value inserted from outside. Same as new investment
from outside.

Value passed out and recovered fully in other assets
rather than exhausted.

Same as pay.

Output of human capital.
