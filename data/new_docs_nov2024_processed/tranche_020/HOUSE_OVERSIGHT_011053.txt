investment building skills. ] don’t see much avenue for investment in adult human
capital except through textbooks and tuition. Some happens. I went back to school at
the Conservatory myself, and I buy lots of textbooks. But I just don’t see enough of it
around me. Models must simplify. Mine would end invested consumption at

independence more or less.

I would also model adult self-invested work as subliminal and costless job
experience. I don’t see it as taking a second away from work for pay. This again is
meant to describe the usual rule only. Ben-Porath’s model, I think, allows an
impression that workers can choose between earning and learning by allocation of
time. The quotes from Schultz in Chapter 5 described that as common. I just don’t
see much of it happening. Rather we tend to work fewer hours at the end of careers,

not the beginning or middle when time for recovery of self-invested work remains.

I said that Ben-Porath’s equations imply

pay = realized work.

I would substitute the pay rule

gross realized work
realized work + human depreciation
= work - self-invested work + human depreciation, (6.17)

pay

as a norm or expectation. It isn’t a guaranteed outcome because deadweight loss
happens to human capital too. We may be hit by a bus, or lose our jobs in a slump, or
be sent to prison or drafted into the army. The pay rule means that recovery is
foreseen. If (6.17) were stated in terms of outcomes, “recovered” would have to be

inserted before “human depreciation”.
