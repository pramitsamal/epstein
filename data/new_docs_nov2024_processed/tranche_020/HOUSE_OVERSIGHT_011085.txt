Investors as to interest means lenders, not borrowers. Interest rates published
historically are rates borrowers are contracted to pay. Interest rates realized by
lenders are less for two reasons. There are friction costs of due diligence,
contracting and collection. Default costs, slight when times are good, can be

catastrophic when times are bad.

Homer and Sylla describe normal contracted rates, not realized rates net of those
costs, as 10% — 40% in Sumer and Babylonia, 6% - 18% in ancient Greece, 5% —
24% in Egypt, and 4% — 12+% in Rome and the Byzantine Empire.* After higher
rates in the dark ages, European mortgages and commercial loans found the range
7% — 25% in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The range settled down to
4% — 14% in the sixteenth century,° and to 3% — 10% by the seventeenth and
eighteenth’. The authors comment:® “...interest rates declined during much of the
later Middle Ages and Renaissance. The earliest short-term rates quoted were
somewhat higher than the last and highest of the western Roman Legal limits. They
were not too different from early Greek rates and were within the range of
Babylonian rates... The later Renaissance rates were well within the range of
modern rates and the lowest were far below modern rates in periods of credit
stringency.” Merchants of Venice in Shakespeare’s time and long before borrowed
from banks, not from Shylocks, and at rather lower cost than merchants of the

twentieth century.

Economics and Biology

Bioeconomics has meant economics informed by biology. I argued that this
describes much or all of classical economics from Petty through Mill, then lapsed
when the marginalists preferred to do without any explanations or justifications of

tastes, and revived a century later to explore Hamilton’s rule.
