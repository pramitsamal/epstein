CHAPTER 8: BANKS, MONEY AND MACROECONOMICS

Splitting up Banks

I started to write a book on banks and money a year ago. I stopped when | realized
that I don’t know enough about the subject. I have some experience and have done
some reading in those fields, but not enough to justify a whole book. A chapter, or

part of a chapter, is more like it.

Sumerian temples doubled as banks, mostly for agricultural loans to finance the next
crop. It is from their records, in clay tablets, that we know they understood

compound interest and the capitalization formula.

Deposit-and-lend banks as we know them today emerged in Venice and other
European cities in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Chapter 1 said that equity
investors cannot be attracted at leverage (deposit/equity) of less than 10:1, that
even one tenth so much leverage is unstable in high winds, and that we rebuild the
banking system after every systemic failure because we blamed the high winds

rather than the rickety structure.

I said that the solution is to split up banks as we know them into deposit banks
which invest in ETFs on the one side, and lending banks which raise funds from
investors rather than depositors on the other. These entities would have separate

stockholders, and would not interact unless incidentally.

A different kind of bank split-up has been urged since the 2008 crash. Repeal of the
Glass-Steagle act had allowed commercial (deposit-and-lend) banks to operate as
investment banks (brokerage firms). Many blamed the crash on that repeal, and on
investment bank innovations such as mortgage-backed securities. I think those
critics are looking in the wrong direction. The problem, as with most bank crashes
over the centuries, was overleverage encouraged by nearly costless deposits. The

solution is not to peel off brokerage operations from the mix, but to peel off deposits.
