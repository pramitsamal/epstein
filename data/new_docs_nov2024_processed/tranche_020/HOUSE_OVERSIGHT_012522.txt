Before you went cver to Jeffrey's house
after you net ii in person, did she tell you if anyone
asked you how old you were, how old you were supposed to
Say you were?

A.

Q. She didn't give you a script and say as
soon as you walk in the house you're supposed to say,
I'm 18, right?

A. No.

Q. And I assume if you were asked, you wanted
to be convincing that you were cver the age of 18,
because you wanted to do the work, right?
A, Right.
QO. By the way, were you ever asked?
Eventually.
Okay.
A. Not the first day, I don't believe.
Q. Okay. Was it Jeffrey or someone else that

asked you whether you were over the age of 18?
