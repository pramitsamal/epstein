Named for James Madison, the fourth president and “father of the Now Live
Constitution, this stately hotel has traditional style and refined service -
plus, a location that puts many of Washington's must-see museums and
monuments along the Mall within walking distance. Opened in 1963, the
353-room hotel has hosted the Dalai Lama, the occasional celebrity and
every U.S. president since John F. Kennedy except Barack Obama. But
don't worry - you can stop by the White House, which is just five blocks
away.
