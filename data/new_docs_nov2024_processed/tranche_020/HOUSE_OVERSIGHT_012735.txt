The Raleigh - South Beach

The Raleigh is different from most properties in South Beach, with a Starting

vibe that's more Deco cool than decked out to the nines. A stay here Thursday 4/8 at
feels a bit like a trip to the 1940s - dressed in whites one minute, casual

the next. It's all about lounging in style by the pool, which has hosted 8pm BST
everything from Esther Williams swimming routines to Chanel's cruise =
collection show. The Raleigh itself is a lot like that pool: cool, pretty and
a place to be seen.
