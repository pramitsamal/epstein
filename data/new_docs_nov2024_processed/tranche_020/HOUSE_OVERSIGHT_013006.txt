volved. These are very low level processes whose analogues in human experience are largely
below the conscious level.

A Goal is considered as a statement that the system may strive to make true at some future
time. A Motive is an (urge, goal) pair, consisting of a goal whose satisfaction is predicted to
imply the satisfaction of some urge. In fact one may consider Urges as top-level goals, and the
agent’s other goals as their subgoals.

In Psi an agent has one “ruling motive” at any point in time, but this seems an oversimpli-
fication more applicable to simple animals than to human-like or other advanced AI systems.
In general one may think of different motives having different weights indicating the amount of
resources that will be spent on pursuing them.

Emotions in Psi are considered as complex systemic response-patterns rather than explicitly
constructed entities. An emotion is the set of mental entities activated in response to a certain
set of urges. Dorner conceived theories about how various common emotions emerge from the
dynamics of urges and motives as described in the Psi model. “Intentions” are also considered as
composite entities: an intention at a given point in time consists of the active motives, together
with their related goals, behavior programs and so forth.
