The AverageLink invokes an estimation of the average TruthValue of the embedded expression
(in this case an ImplicationLink) over all possible values of the variable $X. If there are type
restrictions regarding the variable $X, these are taken into account in conducting the averaging.
For AllLink and Exist s-Link may be used in the same places as AverageLink, with uncertain
truth value semantics defined in PLN theory using third-order probabilities. There is also a
ScholemLink used to indicate variable dependencies for existentially quantified variables, used
in cases of multiply nested existential quantifiers.

EvaluationLink and MemberLink have overlapping semantics, allowing expression of the
same conceptual/logical relationships in terms of predicates or sets, i.e.

EvaluationLink
PredicateNode: eat
ListLink
$X
ConceptNode: food

has the same semantics as

ConceptNode: EatingEvents

The relation between the predicate eat and the concept EatingEvents is formally given by

ExtensionalEquivalenceLink
ConceptNode: EatingEvents
SatisfyingSetLink

PredicateNode: eal

In other words, we say that EatingEvents is the SatisfyingSet of the predicate eat: it is the
set of entities that satisfy the predicate eat. Note that the truth values of MemberLink and
EvaluationLink are fuzzy rather than probabilistic.
