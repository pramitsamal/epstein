13.3.3 Logical Links

251

There is a host of link types embodying logical relationships as defined in the PLN logic system,

e.g.

e InheritanceLink
e SubsetLink (aka ExtensionalInheritanceLink)
e Intensional InheritanceLink

which embody different sorts of inheritance, e.g.

SubsetLink salmon fish
IntensionalInheritanceLink whale fish
InheritanceLink fish animal

and then

e SimilarityLink
e ExtensionalSimilarityLink
e IntensionalSimilarityLink

which are symmetrical versions, e.g.

SimilaritytLink shark barracuda
IntensionalSimilarityLink shark dolphin
ExtensionalSimiliarityLink American obese\_person

There are also higher-order versions of these links, both asymmetric

e ImplicationLink
e ExtensionallmplicationLink
e IntensionallmplicationLink

and symmetric

e EquivalenceLink
e ExtensionalEquivalenceLink
e IntensionalEquivalenceLink

These are used between predicates and links, e.g.

ImplicationLink
EvaluationLink
eat
ListLink
$X
aan,
EvaluationLink
feel
ListLink
$X
sick
