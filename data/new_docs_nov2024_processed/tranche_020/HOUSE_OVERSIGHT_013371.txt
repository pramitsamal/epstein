representation of his clients can serve as the basis for a civil lawsuit against him. Allegations

: A. Epstein’s Complaint

Epstein’s Second Amended Complaint essentially alleges that Epstein was damaged by
Edwards, acting in concert with Scott Rothstein (President of the Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law

“pump” the cases to Ponzi scheme investors. As described by Epstein, investor victims were
told by Rothstein that three minor girls who were sexually assaulted by Epstein: L.M., E.W., and
I ane Doe were to be paid up-front money to prevent those girls from settling their civil cases
against Epstein. In Epstein’s view, these child sexual assault cases had “minimal value”
(Complaint & 42(h)), and Edwards’s refusal to force his clients to accept modest settlement
offers is claimed to breach some duty that Edwards owed to Epstein. Interestingly, Epstein never
states that he actually made any settlement offers.
