»- AN E-MAIL YOU NEED TO READ

There is nothing the busy man is less busied with than living; there is nothing harder to learn.

— SENECA

For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every moming and asked myself: “If today
were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever
the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something ...
almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure —
these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
have something to lose.

—STEVE JOBS, college dropout and CEO of Apple Computer, Stanford University

L you’re confused about life, you’re not alone. There are almost seven billion of us. This isn’t a

problem, of course, once you realize that life is neither a problem to be solved nor a game to be won.

If you are too intent on making the pieces of a nonexistent puzzle fit, you miss out on all the real fun.
The heaviness of success-chasing can be replaced with a serendipitous lightness when you recognize that
the only rules and limits are those we set for ourselves.

So be bold and don’t worry about what people think. They don’t do it that often anyway.

Two years ago, I was forwarded the following poem—originally written by child psychologist David
L. Weatherford—by a close friend. He quit his own deferred-life plan after reading it, and I hope you
will do the same. Here it is.

SLOW DANCE

Have you ever watched kids
On a merry-go-round?

Or listened to the rain
Slapping on the ground?

Ever followed a butterfly’s erratic flight?
Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?

You better slow down.
Don’t dance so fast.

Time is short.
The music won’t last.

Do you run through each day
On the fly?
