its 2% core PCE target. Our economists think that the Fed may well aim a little high in
the short term on inflation to ensure they have sufficient room to ease in the event of a
downturn. However, it is unlikely that the Fed would tolerate a sustained overshoot of
their inflation objective. That is particularly the case if the Fed under President Trump is
made more hawkish as our economists think it probably will be (see Liquid Insight:
Trump’s stamp on the FOMC).

Equally, our economists in Europe are sceptical on the ECB’s ability to get inflation to
rise significantly from current levels. Optically there is scope for European breakevens
to head higher if the ECB were to be successful but investors are likely to want to see
some evidence of rising inflation first before they price that in. We will return to this
below. For now we agree with our fixed income strategists that the rise in inflation
expectations is probably sufficient and that any rise in yields from here has to be one of
higher real yields.

They think such a rise as a tightening of monetary conditions which may be self-limiting
in the short term, particularly as the fiscal boost in the US is likely to be back loaded in
terms of 2017. If rates move too quickly and the USD follows before the fiscal stimulus
kicks in they could actually dampen growth. Indeed, our US economists have shaved
their near term growth forecasts already to reflect the current moves. They do not
expect the fiscal stimulus to start to boost growth before the 3” quarter.

Fiscal + hawkish Trump Fed means we stay short 5Y US via 2-5-10 butterfly

Our fixed income team estimated how much fair values of the different parts of the
curve would have to move were the market to move into line with the dot plot. Updating
those estimates for the move since their publication we find 2Y rates can move another
11bp, 5Y 39bp and 10Y 33bp. They argue that given we are past the inflection point for
rates, with fiscal policy being eased and now with a more hawkish Fed under Trump
likely, the dot plot should form the floor not the ceiling for rate expectations. All of this
translates into a view that 10Y yields can push to 2.65% by the second half of 2017.
Given their views on the curve we continue to run the 2-5-10 butterfly. It has moved
from around -10bp to +10bp since the election, and our fixed income strategists have
moved their target to +20bp.
