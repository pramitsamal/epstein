eBay (Buy, $38 PO)

Stock view: Marketplace growth should improve in 2017

eBay’s 4Q results showed signs of Marketplace improvement, with improving mobile
and C2C trends and a modest pickup in new buyers. Management expects to put
marketing dollars behind this trend to drive Marketplace growth momentum in 2017
(guidance calls for 1 point of acceleration in Marketplace volume in 1Q, with 2 points for
the full year). Expectations have risen since the start of the year, and we think eBay
needs to deliver 1 point acceleration in US GMV growth vs 1Q to maintain confidence in
management’s execution. There is also significant interest in eBay’s first party ad
strategy and potential improvement in transaction take rates (at expense of MS&O
revenues).

The potential structured data impact also remains top of mind for investors as
structured data will provide the backbone for improving customer search and product
experiences. As of 4Q’16, there are 180mn+ structured data pages v. 100mn+ pages at
the end of 3Q’16. More pages are expected in 2017, which will start to be exposed to
core organic traffic. Management appears confident that the impact of structured data
would increasingly benefit results and that structured data formats will be much more
visible by holiday 2017. Overall, if 1Q results are at/above expectations, we think the
stock will reflect even more optimism on structured data improvement.

For margins, we expect continued pressure in 2017 as the company ramps up marketing
spend and increases its Al capabilities. If the company can manage to accelerate top
line growth through conversion rate improvements, some of the upside may be invested,
limiting 2017 earnings flow through (but benefitting growth in 2018). Therefore, we
think customer, transaction and revenue trends most important for 2017, but lack of
margin flow through could be sentiment headwind for the stock.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Marketplace growth/outlook

Our model assumes US GMV growth of 3.5% y/y, an 80bps q/q acceleration off an 80ps
easier y/y comp, while we anticipate 6.0% y/y Intl ex-FX GMV growth. US acceleration
(despite a modest Leap Year headwind) is likely needed to maintain increased
management confidence. Our model assumes 8.3% take rate, which is up 10bps y/y and
could be aided by the early transition to 1* party advertising on the site. eBay’s 1Q
revenue guide implies 5% y/y ex-FX growth at the midpoint, while the 2017 revenue
guide calls for 7% ex-FX growth, implying revenue growth acceleration during the year.

confidence in future improvement.
