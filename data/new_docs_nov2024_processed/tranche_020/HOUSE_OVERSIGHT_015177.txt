Liberation Front. You’ ve probably seen their frontline members on the
street and in airports, selling little cards with the sign-language alphabet.
Some have been getting arrested for being deaf without a license.
Naturally, the police recite their Miranda rights, shouting, “You have the
right to remain silent!

Anyway, this particular Ex-Lax commercial features a pleasant,
matronly woman reminiscing through her family photo album while a
young fellow in the corner of the screen ostensibly translates the message
into sign language. Actually, he can say whatever he wants. Nobody
monitors his translation. He can indulge in private jokes for all the deaf
viewers and only they will know.

The matronly woman in the Ex-Lax commercial says: “Thank God
my family is normal” The young fellow shifts the emphasis slightly in his
translation: “Thank God her family is normal.” She continues: “Of
course, once in a while somebody in our family will be troubled by
irregularity.” He translates: “No shit.” She concludes: “So then we do
what we’ ve done in our family for generations—we turn to an old friend,
Ex-Lax.” He translates: “Jimmy Hoffa knows too much.”

And while the hearing-impaired at home _ giggle at_ this

mistranslation, all over the globe the shit continues to hit the fans.
