Johnnie Cochran Meets Dr. Hip

Tragedy and absurdity were two sides of the same coin: On one side,

O.J. Simpson’ s_ “suicide” note with a smiley face in the O of his
signature; on the other side, the woman who pinched Simpson lawyer
Robert Shapiro’ s ass because “I wanted to be part of history.” And
somewhere along the ridge of that coin was Simpson himself, walking into
the courtroom humming the melody of “Touch Me” from the Broadway
hit Cats and explaining to reporters that he was thinking about his
children.

That was at Simpson’ s criminal trial. Shortly before his civil trial
began in 1997, | met his lead attorney, Johnnie Cochran. He was the guest
of honor and luncheon speaker at a national convention of criminal
defense attorneys held in a huge banquet hall at a hotel in Santa Monica.
No media people were allowed entry.

One of the attendees was Dr. Eugene Schoenfeld, also known as Dr.
Hip from his days as a syndicated columnist for the underground press. He
now testifies occasionally as an expert witness, and was at this event for

that reason. My wife Nancy and | were his guests.
