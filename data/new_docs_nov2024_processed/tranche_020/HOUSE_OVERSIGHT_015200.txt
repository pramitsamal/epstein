convention. In one workshop, “The ABC’ s of Swinging,” condom
etiquette is described as bringing “the right safety equipment, just as you
would for scuba diving or parachuting.” Another presentation on “Safer

Sex” covers new drug therapies for AIDS, information on other sexually
transmitted diseases that are increasing among heterosexuals, and
“things you should be doing to protect yourself.”

Some swing clubs closed, though private parties increased. But,
paradoxically enough, with the advent of AIDS, new clubs opened, as if the
disease were anti-climactic. Currently, there’ s a surge of growth in this
subculture—thanks to the Internet—with estimates ranging from 2,000 to
three million participants. And, according to Dr. McGinley, “There’ s been
very little increase in condom use. It’ s the woman’ s choice.”
