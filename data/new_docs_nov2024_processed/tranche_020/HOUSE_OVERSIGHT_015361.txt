jaw and nodding his head in affirmation of a new discovery. “So,” he
observed, “it’ s against the law to get you horny.”

When we were about to leave the room, he stood in the doorway.

“Did you steal anything?” he asked furtively. | took my watch out of my
pocket since | didn't like to wear it on my wrist, and without saying a word
| placed it on the bureau. Lenny laughed one loud staccato “Ha” and
kissed me on the forehead.

We developed a friendship integrated with stand-up comedy. In_ his
act Lenny had broken through traditional stereotypical jokes about
airplane food, nagging wives, Chinese drivers, annoying mothers-in-law.
Instead he weaved his taboo-breaking targets--teachers' low salaries
versus show-business celebs, religious leaders’ hypocrisy, cruel abortion
laws, racial injustice, the double standard between illegal and prescription
drugs--into stream-of-consciousness vignettes.

In each succeeding performance, he would sculpt and re-sculpt his
concept into a theatrical context, experimenting from show to show like a
verbal jazz musician. Audience laughter would sometimes turn into
clapping for the creative process itself. “Please don't applaud,” he’ d

request. “It breaks my rhythm.”
