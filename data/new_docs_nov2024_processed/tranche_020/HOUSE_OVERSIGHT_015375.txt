and Hardy,” he mused. “A miniature Laurel and Hardy, one on each
shoulder. Your little Oliver Hardy bawls you out--he says, ‘Well, this is a
fine mess you've gotten us into.’ And your little Stan Laurel gets all
weepy-—--Oh, Ollie, | couldn't help it. I'm sorry, | did the best | could.’ ”

Later, when Groucho started chuckling to himself, | hesitated to
interrupt his reverie, but | had to ask, “What struck you funny?”

“| was thinking about this movie, Skidoo, he said. “Il mean some
of it is just plain ridiculous. This hippie inmate puts a letter he got, which is
soaked in LSD, into the water supply of the prison, and suddenly
everybody gets completely reformed. There's a prisoner who says, ‘Oh,
gosh, now | don't have to be a rapist any more!’ But it's also
sophisticated in its own way. | like how Jackie Gleason, the character he
plays, accepts the fact that he's not the biological father of his daughter.”

“Oh, really? That sounds like the ultimate ego loss.”

“But I'm really getting a big kick out of playing somebody named
God like a dirty old man. You wanna know why?”

“Typecasting?”

“No, no--it's because--do you realize that irreverence and
reverence are the same thing?’

“Always?”
