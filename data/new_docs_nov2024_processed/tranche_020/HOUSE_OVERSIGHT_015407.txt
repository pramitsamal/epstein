my place.” She added, “Please re-blog and spread the word.” And

indeed, it went viral.

Coincidentally, on the same night that Tosh, in his signature
Sarcastic approach to reality, provoked the woman, Sarah Silverman was
performing at Foxwords Casino, and she touched upon the same taboo
subject: “We need more rape jokes. We really do. Needless to say, rape,
the most heinous crime imaginable, seems it’ sacomic’ s dream, though.
It' s because it seems when you do rape jokes, that the material is so
dangerous and edgy, and the truth is, it’ s like the safest area to talk
about in comedy‘ cause who’ s gonna complain about a rape joke? Rape
victims? They don’ t even report rape. They’ re just traditionally not

complainers.”

Ironically, in 7he Aristocrats, a documentary entirely about a classic
joke of the same name, Silverman complained (facetiously) that she was
once raped by show-biz legend Joe Franklin. Also, her rape tips for men
include, Carry a rape whistle. If you find that you are about to rape
someone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you. However,
another joke of hers goes like this: “Il was raped by a doctor—which is so

bittersweet for a Jewish girl.”
