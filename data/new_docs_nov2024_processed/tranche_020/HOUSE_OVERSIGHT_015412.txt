Trump reading out loud from a report that “80% of Central American
women and girls are raped crossing into the United Sates.” CNN’ s Don
Lemon tells Trump, “That’ s about women being raped, it’ s not about
criminals coming across the border or entering the country.”

Trump: ” Somebody’ s doing the raping, Don.

“Touche!l,” said Stewart. “| believe we have our campaign slogan:
Trump 2016--Somebody’ s Doing the Raping.

Immediately after The Daily Show came The Nightly Showwith Larry
Wilmore. He plays the same clip just a slightly bit longer: Trump spouting,
” Somebody’ s doing the raping, Don. | mean, you know, somebody’ s
doing the rapiing, You think the women are being raped. Well, who’ s
doing the raping?” Wilmore repeats: “Who’ s doing the raping? Okay,
who’ s bringing the chips? Who’ s bringing the beer? Wait, wait. Who’ s
doing the raping? Oh, okay, sorry about that. | didn’ t know, | had to ask. |
have to tell you, though, as far as campaign slogans go: Donald Trump
2016--Who’ s Doing the Raping?” Hey, it sounds familiar already.

And on Bill Maher’ s Rea/ Time the reactionary blond witch Ann
Coulter defended Trump: “These aren’ t people we have to have here.
We already have our own rapists and murderers. We don’ t need to be

bringing in more rapists and murderers.”
