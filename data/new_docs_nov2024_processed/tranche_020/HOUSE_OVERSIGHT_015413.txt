Although Daniel Tosh is a consistently unapologetic performer for
the sardonic material he exudes on his Comedy Central series--which
features a running theme of rape jokes, even including one about his sister--
for this occasion he decided to go the Twitter route: “All the out of
context misquotes aside, I’ d like to sincerely apologize.” He also
tweeted, “The point | was making before | was heckled is there are awful
things in the world but you can still make jokes about them.”

According to Jamie Masada, owner of the Laugh Factory, Tosh asked
the audience, “What you guys wanna talk about?” Someone called out

“Rape,” and a woman in the audience started screaming, “No, rape is
painful, don’ t talk about it.”. Then, says Masada, “Daniel came in, and
he said, ‘Well, it sounds like she’ s been raped by five
guys’ —something like that. | didn’ t hear properly. It was a comment—it
wasn’ t a joke at the expense of this girl.” Masada claims that she sat
through the rest of Tosh’ s performance, which received a standing
ovation, before she complained to the manager.

Fellow comedians defended Tosh with their own tweets. Dane Cook:

“If you journey through this life easily offended by other peoples words |

think it’ s best for everyone if you just kill yourself.” Doug Stanhope:
