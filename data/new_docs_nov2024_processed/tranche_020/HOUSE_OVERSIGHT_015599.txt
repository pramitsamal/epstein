Defendant.

MOTION TO QUASH OR FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER REGARDING
SUBPOENA SERVED ON NON-PARTY JANE DOE NO. 3

Non-party Jane Doe 3, by and through undersigned counsel and pursuant to Florida Rules
of Civil Procedure 1.410(c)(1)', hereby moves for an order quashing the subpoena duces tecum
served on her by Defendant, or alternatively, pursuant to Florida Rules of Civil Procedure 1.280(c)

for issuance of a protective order sharply limiting the scope of the subpoena.
INTRODUCTION

This Court should quash the subpoena issued to non-party Jane Doe No. 3 as it is
unreasonable and oppressive. The Defendant is abusing the subpoena power in an effort to
intimidate, harass and cause undue burden to a non-party. Indeed, Defendant - just days ago -
publicly admitted that his goal of deposing Jane Doe No. 3 has nothing to do with this Florida
Defamation Action; rather, he is trying to find a way to send this victim of sexual trafficking to

“Jail.” “She was hiding in Colorado...but we found her and she will have to be deposed. The end

* For the limited purpose of the Motion to Quash or for Protective Order and resolving the scope of the
subpoena and any enforcement issues, Jane Doe No. 3 voluntarily submits herself to this Court’s
jurisdiction.
