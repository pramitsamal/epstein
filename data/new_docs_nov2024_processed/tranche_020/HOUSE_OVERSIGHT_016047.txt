e celebrate creativity with many competitions and prizes. I
W been a student of problem lists of over the years. Here
is my list of the problems remaining open in the modern
world. I’ve tied it in with other lists where relevant, and indicate what
you might win if you were to solve one. As I was writing this book, a few

of the questions were answered; the Higgs Boson was discovered and the
Poincaré Conjecture proven. I will keep the list up to date on the web site.

2. Physi cs Nobel Prize for Physics

2.1 Are there many worlds or just one?

2.2 Does quantum collapse have meaning?

2.3 Will we find the Higgs-Boson? (Provisionally yes, 2012)

2.4 Do we need quantum gravity to explain human thought?

2.5 Will we observe gravitational waves, and what is the
current explanation for gravitational noise?

2.6 What causes the arrow of time and the asymmetry of
physical laws?

2.7 Do the constants of physics change over time?

2.8 Is quantum computation sufficient to simulate the universe,
or is the universe non-computational?

2.9 Can magnetic monopoles exist?

2.10 What is meant by quantum non-locality, a.k.a., spooky

action at a distance?
