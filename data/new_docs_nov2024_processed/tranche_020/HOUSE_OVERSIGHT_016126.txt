Ambitious non-oil export and tourism targets, but little details
The NTP targets increasing non-oil exports by SAR145bn (US$38bn, 6.0% of GDP) to
SAR330bn (USS$88bn, 11.4% of 2020f GDP) over the next five years. Although
implementation details are lacking, we anticipate that part of the increase could be
linked to the higher mining output targeted. These would nevertheless be dependent on
the global economic cycle. Higher exports of refined oil products, if all of the additional
capacity to be installed by 2020 is exported, could add cUS$7.3bn to exports at current
price levels (but not qualify towards non-oil exports targets under the NTP as they are
classified as hydrocarbon exports). Currently, 61% of Saudi non-oil exports represents
chemicals and plastics, and maintains a correlation with oil prices, and re-exports
account for another 17% of total non-oil exports and have little added-value.

Likewise, the focus on religious tourism is appropriate given its importance in Saudi
Arabia but NTP targets appear ambitious to us with a targeted 20%yoy CAGR increase
in Umrah pilgrims. Religious tourism accounted for c40% of total tourist expenditure in
Saudi Arabia in 2015, bringing in proceeds of SAR33.4bn (US$8.9bn; 1.4% of GDP). Note
that, for balance of payment purposes, total tourism revenues stood instead at
SAR37.9bn (US$10.1bn; 1.6% of GDP). The NTP targets would thus imply religious
tourism external revenues/expenditures to increase to US$10-US$20bn (1.3-2.6% of
2020f GDP). This would be helpful on the external front but not a game changer on its
own, in our view.
