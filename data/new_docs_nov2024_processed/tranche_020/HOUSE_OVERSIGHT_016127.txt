Mixed prospects for fiscal consolidation

The apparent redistribution of part of the proceeds of the flagship fiscal measures
towards funding the NTP initiatives suggests that the fiscal consolidation efforts could
fall short of the necessary requirement to narrow imbalances materially in the absence
of a sustained oil price recovery. We calculate that the NTP targets a total net
cumulative fiscal consolidation effort of SAR648bn (US$172.8bn) or c1% of GDP
annually, assuming progressive and full implementation of the non-oil revenue targets.

Energy policy needs to support economic transformation

Energy policy is likely to be less aggressive going forward, particularly as the NTP
suggests a constant oil production capacity as well as an increase in gas production
domestically which could free up domestic crude for exports. To remain consistent with
the targeted government debt accumulation path, we estimate that oil prices have to
average at least US$50/bbl in 2016-20 along with no growth in spending from 2016
levels (excluding the additional cost of NTP initiatives but including implementation of
the NTP non-oil revenue measures). Oil prices of at least cCUS$65/bbl would be required
if spending is not disciplined or revenue targets are missed by c50%, in our view.

Blueprint for fiscal measures lacks details

The approved NTP initiatives will have a total fiscal cost of SAR268bn (USS71.5bn;
11.6% of GDP) spread over five years (annually, SAR54bn equivalent to US$14.3bn or
2.3% of GDP). Government financing could represent 60% of total funding needs for the
NTP initiatives, with total NTP costs of SAR447bn (USS$119bn; 18.4% of GDP). Against
that, the NTP envisages raising SAR366bn in non-oil revenues and cut the wage bill by
5% or SAR24bn (USS$6.4bn or 1% of GDP). Non-oil revenue is seen rising to SAR530bn
(USS141bn, 23% of 2016f GDP) by 2020 from SAR163.5bn (7% of GDP).

Wage bill measure unclear but may carry profound social implications

In an unprecedented austerity measure, the share of the wage bill in total spending
would fall by 5ppt to 40% (SAR456bn, from SAR480bn) by 2020. It is yet unclear how
this could be achieved in practice. Furthermore, note that the MoF budget
announcement estimated the wage bill in 2015 to stand at SAR450bn, blurring the
target. Privatizations of government entities are likely to lead to a natural drop in the
public sector number of employees and wage bill. Yet we note that the Ministry of Civil
Service has two Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) directly linked to a decrease in the
payroll and benefits expenditure, and to a reduction in workers in the civil service sector.
This would likely be a contentious and unpopular measure to implement, and its
implementation and success appear challenging to us.
