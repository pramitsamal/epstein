Budgeted defence spending — up or down

Localization policies in the defence industry could help cut imports (total defence
imports of USS$9.8bn equivalent to US$1.5bn or 6% of total imports in 2015, according
to consultancy IHS) and conserve Fx reserves, but we expect this to be a slow and
gradual process. We think that large defense imports are typically amortized over a
number of years. Defence spending is an important part of fiscal spending in Saudi
Arabia, accounting for c30% of total budgeted spending. Defence spending in 2016 was
budgeted at SAR213bn (US$56.9bn; 9.0% of GDP), down from SAR307bn (US$81.8bn;
12.7% of GDP) in 2015. Increased military and security projects in 2015 saw an
additional overspend of SAR2Obn last year. It is unclear to us if all of the regional
military costs have been recognised on-balance sheet. A negotiated settlement to the
Yemen conflict through the ongoing political negotiations in Kuwait could help contain
security spending near-term.
