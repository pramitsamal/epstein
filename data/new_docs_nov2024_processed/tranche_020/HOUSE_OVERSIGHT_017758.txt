2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *910

forbid retrial even when a victim has received no notice, *°° and the CVRA itself bars a new trial remedy. *?? Sentencings
would appear to be subject to limitations that might prevent a crime victim from obtaining a resentencing *°° - although the
CVRA directly allows for re-sentencings in certain limited circumstances. 3°!

While neither trial nor sentencing could proceed without proper notice to the victim, this restriction will affect only a small
number of cases for a short period of time. Many federal cases lack a specifically identifiable victim (e.g., drug and
immigration offenses) and thus are not covered by the CVRA. In those cases with a victim, a significant percentage of victims
may waive any right to receive notice. In cases where victims choose to receive notice, presumably the notice will be properly
given the vast majority of the time. Even apart from notice requirements, most victims will be trial witnesses and therefore will
have been notified of the trial by a subpoena. Victims will also often be aware of sentencings through the work of probation
officers in preparing presentence reports. 302 Th the tiny fraction of cases where notice has not been properly provided, notice
will often be only a [*911] telephone call away. While the burdens of delaying a trial or sentencing are not trivial, Congress
has determined that the victim's rights must take precedence. Proposed subsection (b) faithfully implements that determination.

Subsection (c) of the proposed rule deals with the victim's right to attend in situations involving multiple victims. Congress has
recognized that in some cases, such as the Oklahoma City bombing case, it is impossible to afford all victims the opportunity to
attend trials. Accordingly, the CVRA provides that where the number of crime victims makes it impracticable to protect
rights for all victims, the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to give effect to victims' interests. 3° Possible
procedures include closed-circuit transmission of the proceedings to a ceremonial courtroom, auditorium, or other facility that
can accommodate many people. To permit such transmission, an amendment to Rule 53 is proposed below. 3

Subsection (d) gives victims a general right to be heard on issues directly affecting their rights. The CVRA specifically
mandates that victims have the right to be heard with regard to release of the defendant, a plea, or a sentence. 3°° The right to
be heard at these hearings has been addressed elsewhere in these proposed rules, °° but courts will sometimes consider other
issues that directly affect victims' rights. For example, courts may consider whether to release the address and telephone
number of the victim to the defendant. 3°7 It makes little sense for the court to decide this issue without hearing from the
victim, particularly since the CVRA gives victims the right to be reasonably protected from the accused. 3°8 Subsection (d)

300 See Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c) (correction of sentence allowed only for technical or other clear error). Whether denial of a victim's right

constitutes clear error subject to correction presumably will need to be resolved in future cases. Cf. United States v. Bedonie, 413 F.3d 1126
(10th Cir. 2005) (remedying error in restitution award not permitted after imposition of sentence).

301-18 U.S.C.A. 3771(d)(5) (authorizing a victim motion to re-open a ... sentence if the victim's right to be heard was denied); see 150
Cong. Rec. $10,910 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (discussing this provision). In light of these provisions, the Advisory
Committee may need to consider redrafting Rule 35 to allow reopening of sentences imposed in violation of victims' rights.
