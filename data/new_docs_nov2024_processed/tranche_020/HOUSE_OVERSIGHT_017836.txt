To establish personal jurisdiction on a

specific facts warranting the inference that

spiracy, and show that the defendant’s co-
conspirator committed a tort in New York.

To warrant the inference that an out-
of-state defendant was a member of a con-
spiracy, as required for a court to exercise
personal jurisdiction under New York’s
long-arm statute on the basis of the acts of
co-conspirators in New York, plaintiffs
must show that: (1) the defendant had an
awareness of the effects in New York of its
activity; (2) the activity of the co-conspira-
tors in New York was to the benefit of the
out-of-state conspirators; and (8) the co-
conspirators acting in New York acted at
the direction or under the control or at the
request of or on behalf of the out-of-state
defendant. N.Y.McKinney’s CPLR
302(a)(2).

Allegations by victims’ survivors, that
various defendants, including Saudi Ara-

necessary to establish personal jurisdiction
as to Antiterrorism Act (ATA) claims un-
der New York’s long-arm statute, absent
specific facts from which district court
could infer that defendants directed, con-
trolled, or requested al Qaeda to under-
take its terrorist activities, or specific alle-
gations of defendants’ knowledge of or
consent to those activities. 18 U.S.C.A.
