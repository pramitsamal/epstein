Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 22 of 28

78. Wholly absent at this point was any assertion by Mr. Dershowitz that Ms. Roberts
was lying, or that she made up her charge as part of an extortion claim, or that after investigating
his alleged evidence Ms. Roberts’ lawyer did not believe her. On the contrary, Mr. Dershowitz
expressly recognized that Ms. Roberts’ belief was an honest one. All Mr. Dershowitz was
pleading for was an acknowledgement that there was a “possibility” that there “may be” a case of
mistaken identification. Even that plea was rejected by Ms. Roberts and her lawyers as
misleading.

79.  Dershowitz’s present PR claim that Roberts’ lawyers disbelieved their client, and
that Roberts intentionally committed perjury as part of an extortion scheme, is just another
Dershowitz lie. His reliance on statements taken out of context, his failure to include the
statements of Roberts’ lawyer after Dershowitz’s supposed evidence had been investigated, and
the damning admissions of his own lawyers, reveal Dershowitz’s total lack of support for his
allegation that Roberts and her lawyers concocted knowingly false allegation against him as part
of a supposed extortion plot.

80. Dershowitz also lied to attempt to deflect Sarah Ransome’s revelations about him.
Ms. Ransome revealed that during the time she was a victim of Epstein’s sex trafficking,
Epstein’s arranged for his lawyer, Dershowitz, to also represent Ms. Ransome. Ms. Ransome
also described how, during the time Dershowitz was her lawyer, Epstein lent her out to
Dershowitz for sex. (Exhibit 14).

81. Dershowitz asserted that he never had sex with Ms. Ransome, that he never
represented Ms. Ransome, that he did not even know Ms. Ransome, and that Ms. Ransome’s
statements about him were fabricated by Ms. Roberts’ lawyer in retaliation for a bar complaint

that Dershowitz had filed against that lawyer (Exhibit 16). However, as Dershowitz knew:
