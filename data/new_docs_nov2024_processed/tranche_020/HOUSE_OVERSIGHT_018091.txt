championship of the Palestinian cause, themselves became the
enemies of the people, being crowned during the current
revolutionary period with infamy and dishonour. This applies to the
former regime in Iraq, the regime in Syria and the Mubarak regime in
Egypt.

The case of Hizbullah reflects this revolutionary predicament with
respect to the Palestinian cause and the struggle against Israel. It
suffices to recall which side this group came down upon when it had
to chose between the Syrian people, who are presently fighting for
their future and for the future of their children, and a regime that has
thrived off a conflict in which it has never fired a single shot to
liberate the Golan Heights from Israeli occupation, regardless of its
political posturing.

All this leads to the question of whether Netanyahu's new position is
based on some type of analysis of the ongoing Arab revolutions.
Does he believe that they will turn out to be like their predecessors
and feed off the Palestinian cause, for example, and has this led him
to want to deal firmly with them from the outset? Egypt received a
message to the effect that Al-Qaeda was in control of the Sinai and
that Israel therefore felt itself free to act as it wishes.

Alternatively, could Netanyahu's thinking be headed in another
direction, such that the current Arab revolutions are seeking to rectify
the fatal habit of previous revolutions of focussing on external affairs
at the expense of domestic needs and that they will therefore seek to
avert wars, conflicts and attendant tribulations?

Surely it is no coincidence that a leading Nasserist Arab nationalist
and presidential candidate, Hamdeen Sabahi, has stated several times
that he has no intention of opening hostilities against Israel and every
intention instead of waging war on poverty and fighting for
educational and healthcare reforms and other such urgent domestic
causes.
