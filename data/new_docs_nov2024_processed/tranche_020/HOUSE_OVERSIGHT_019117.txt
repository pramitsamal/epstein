AutHor’s Note

conducted by Connolly’s Vanity Fair colleague Vicky Ward, we
began to put the pieces to gether.

In a few instances, we have re-created brief scenes and
snatches of dialogue. These are based on interviews, police
investigation documents, and court filings. We changed the
names and identities of the girls, hoping to protect them from
more embarrassment and harm.

There never was any doubt that Jeffrey Epstein was guilty. He
admitted as much in the non-prosecution agreement he agreed
to sign in 2007. The question is, what exactly was he guilty of?

This book attempts to answer that question and many others
about this strange and mysterious man. These days people all
around the world are angry about and suspicious of the super
rich and powerful. The story of Jeffrey Epstein is an object lesson
about why we ought to be. To put it simply, some people think
they can operate outside the law. And that’s what they do.
