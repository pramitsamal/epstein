following topics: How to pursue a career of your dream? What makes you feel
empowered? How to build one of a kind brand? How to achieve both self-realization
in professional life and fulfillment personal life?

Our first seminar is going to take place in NYC on April 5. Consequently, we will be
conducting one seminar every month.

Kathy Ruemmler is going to be the first speaker.

Kathy is an attorney who formerly served as White House Counsel to President
Barack Obama. She previously worked as Principal Deputy White House Counsel.

Kathryn Ruemmler is global co-chair of the white-collar defense and investigations
practice at Latham & Watkins. She rejoined the firm after five years in the Obama
administration, first in the Department of Justice and then as President Obama's chief
lawyer, when she headed a team of around 45 lawyers and staff in the White House
Counsel's office. Obama has said she has “an uncanny ability to see around the
corners that no one else anticipates.” Earlier in her career, Ruemmler was a federal
prosecutor who helped secure the convictions of former Enron executives Kenneth
Lay and Jeff Skilling.
