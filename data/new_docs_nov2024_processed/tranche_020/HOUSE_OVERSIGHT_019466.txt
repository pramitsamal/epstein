to Robert DeNiro. We even applauded Bob putting his handprints in cement in front of Grauman's Chinese
Theater.

The conversations continued about how our government put the cabasch on Zero Dark Thirty with their
arrogant denial of enhanced interrogation. Even MPAA President Chris Dodd could not help Mark Boal,
Katherine Bigalow and Amy Pascal.

Additional chatter was the renewed last minute love for Les Miserables. Clearly the most polarizing
film in the race, this 27 year old theatrical musical seen by 60 million fans is now the talk of the
Oscar weekend.

Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Amanda Segfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sasha Baron Cohen, Helena
Bonham Carter and Samanthe Barks are making an historic one time live performance as part of Sunday's
television broadcast. Producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron's will attempt to razzel dazzel us with an
homage to movie musicals for three plus hours at the Dolby theater.

Barbra Streisand, Adele and Shirley Basse's appearances also create high anxiety and a blood bath for
tickets...hence the hysteria created by Dreamworks’ messenger cutting the line.

After checking into the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel, my home away from home for 30 years of Oscar weekends
and meticulously laying out all the ensembles sent from Valentino and Ralph Rucci, I hit the party
circuit overdressed for life.

Daisy... I can do this...fairly easily now...but I have a lunch at 12:30pm and important meetings. I am
so distraught about all this pressure. I am calling you now. Peggy
