CHAPTER 24
Off to Moscow

They talk about Russia like it’s the worst place on earth. Russia’s
great.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2015

EFORE FLYING TO Moscow, I arranged to have dinner with

Oliver Stone at an Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side of
New York. I had greatly respected Stone’s ability as a film director
after watching him work on Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, a film
in which I had a cameo role. I had also debated Stone about the his-
torical accuracy of his 1991 movie JFK at Town Hall in New York.

When we dined, he had just written, produced, and directed
Snowden, an independently financed film depicting Snowden, as
Stone put it, as “one of the great heroes of the twenty-first century.”
In preparing for it, Stone had seen Snowden in 2013 and 2014 and
had had a six-hour meeting with Putin.

I wanted to talk to Stone not to learn about the film but to learn
how he had gained access to Snowden in Moscow. I knew from the
documents taken from Sony Pictures Entertainment—allegedly by
North Korea—that Stone had paid The Guardian $700,000 for the
film rights to The Snowden Files, a book written by Luke Harding.
