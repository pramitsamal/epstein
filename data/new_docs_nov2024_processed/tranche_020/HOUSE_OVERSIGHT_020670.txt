Photographer Donna Ferrato took this gruesome picture back in 1982 when photographing the lives of wealthy swingers.
The couple — Elisabeth and Bengt — were having an argument and it quickly escalated, resulting in Bengt hitting his
partner. The photographer wanted the photo to be published but many publishers refused and she only managed to do so
in 1991. The book was titled ‘Living With the Enemy’ and chronicled events of domestic violence. Thanks to Donna’s

efforts, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994.
