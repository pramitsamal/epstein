Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP):

Recipient of 38% of Net Government (Taxpayer) Funding”

In TARP, the financial rescue program (created in October, 2008),
USA Inc. purchased assets and equity from financial institutions to
provide the capital and liquidity needed during the 2008 financial
crisis (which followed the real estate bubble).

In 2009, TARP recipients were broadened to include automakers, an
insurance company (AIG), individual homeowners, small & medium-
sized businesses and other non-bank financial institutions.

To date, USA Inc. loaned these institutions $464 billion and received
$250 billion in repayment and warrant proceeds for a net outstanding
loan balance of $214 billion.

backed securities and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. 4) Consumers and small & medium-sized businesses that need loans would benefit from

turn fund a substantial portion of the consumer credit and small business loans). Source: Dept. of Treasury, AIG, data as of 2/14/10.
