Beginning in 2007, Wealth Destruction + High Unemployment Forced Consumers

to Save Again, Potentially Reducing Short-Term Demand for Goods & Services

3% average annual GDP growth (1981 - 2007) was helped as the average USA consumer:
1) Increased personal consumption as percent of GDP to 71% from 62%;

2) Decreased personal savings rate to 2% of disposable income from 11%;

Beginning in 2007, things changed as:

1) The average US consumer experienced a material decline in the value of his / her largest
investment assets (real estate and equities) from 2007 to 2009 when peak-to-trough
valuations for USA residential real estate declined 30% and the S&P 500 declined 56%;

2) Unemployment rose to 10% in 2009 / 2010 from 30-year trough of 4% in 1999, creating
uncertainty regarding future personal income levels;

3) Personal savings rate increased to 6% in 2009 / 2010 of disposable income from 2% in 2007,
as uncertainty grows and appetite for consumption ebbs;

All in, the key driver of US GDP growth — the US consumer’s ability to spend — is severely
constrained in the short term as he / she aims to rebuild savings and contain
spending. This raises the question — ‘How fast can US GDP grow annually over the
next ten years?’ Determining ways to drive GDP (and related job growth) is crucial...
