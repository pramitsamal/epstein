The continuing recession and further steep job losses are wearing away the patience of Americans and raising doubts about Obama's
handling of the economy.

The share of Americans who believe the stimulus package will restore the economy slipped to 52 percent in late June, down from 59
percent two months earlier, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.

Vice President Joe Biden said the administration had misread how bad the economy was when it took office but that the stimulus
package would help the economy recovery and create jobs.

Senate Republican Leader Mich McConnell Friday called the stimulus plan a failure.

Obama said it takes time for the plan's money to get out the door to pay for roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that will
create jobs because we are committed to spending it in a way that is effective and transparent.
