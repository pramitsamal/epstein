acknowledge that loneliness is not
synonymous with social isolation but is a
social pain that functions to motivate the
formation and renewal of meaningful
social relationships. When feelings of
loneliness fail to accomplish their
adaptive purpose, chronic loneliness
may ensue. Chronic loneliness tends to
be self-perpetuating through
confirmatory biases that alter cognitions,
emotions, and behaviors. Given the
importance of social connection to
people’s health and well-being, it is
important that we solve the puzzle of
how to help the chronically lonely
connect with others in meaningful and
satisfying ways.
