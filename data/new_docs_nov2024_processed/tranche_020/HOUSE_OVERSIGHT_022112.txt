Vicky Ward: October 2002

pstein went out of his way to spin the Vanity Fair story to
; his own ends, and soon after she got the assignment, Vicky
st : <4 Ward’s phone began to ring off the hook: calls from Ace
| Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, the current head of Bear Stearns;

from Les Wexner; from academics, scientists, and movers and
shakers who counted Epstein among their friends.

Then there were the calls from Epstein himself. He wouldn't
_ go on the record, but despite the rumors he'd spread behind
: Ward’s back, he was happy to talk informally, even give her a
4 tour of his Manhattan mansion and trot out stories that he had
dined out on for years. By most accounts, Epstein could be
 extremely charming—even if it had taken Ghislaine to teach
“him which forks to use when—and he did his best to charm
Vicky Ward. But she was not easily seduced, and she turned out

to have a keen eye for Epstein’s missteps.
