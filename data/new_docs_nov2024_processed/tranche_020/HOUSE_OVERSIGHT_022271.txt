After hosting a few successful events, WE are planning a bigger and better event in
fall. In fact, WE are making a statement that women should not be judged based
on their external beauty and should be rewarded for their intellect and hard work.

The majority of our society still emphasizes the importance of female physical
qualities, such as beauty, body, or photogenic skills. Miss USA, the famous Beauty
Pageant previously owned by Donald Trump, until this summer required the
participants to pose in a swimsuit paired with high heels. Effective this year, the
show will abolish the bikini contest. We think that it is time to take one step
further and to finally start rewarding women for their mind, hard work, and
creativity.

Our idea is to host a “Beauty Pageant” for female entrepreneurs and to have the
top five finalists do a five-minute pitch in front of our jury. The finalists will not
only get a money prize, but also receive a significant exposure to investors and
media. We are hoping to get at least a few hundred applications as the application
is completely free. Female founders should have equal opportunities and
resources to their male counterparts. We hope that our event will encourage other
female entrepreneurs and help them advance in their careers.
