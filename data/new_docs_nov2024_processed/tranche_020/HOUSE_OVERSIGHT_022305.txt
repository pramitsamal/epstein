mislead the plaintiff respecting the

time within which a claimant must file
his or her discrimination charge.’’))

After careful consideration, the Board
is persuaded that the prevailing judicial
view should apply in the NLRA context
as well.148 As an equitable concept,
equitable tolling is a matter of fairness.
The Board has determined that many
employees are unaware of their NLRA
rights and has devised a minimally
burdensome means of attempting to
rectify that situation—requiring
employers to post workplace notices
informing employees of those rights. To
bar an employee who is excusably
unaware of the NLRA from seeking a
remedy for a violation of NLRA rights
because he or she failed to file an unfair
labor practice charge within the 10(b)
period, when the employer did not post
the required notice, would unfairly
deprive the employee of the protection
of the Act because of the employer’s
failure to comply with its legal
responsibilities. To deny equitable
tolling in such circumstances “would
grant to the employee a right to be
informed without redress for violation.”’
Bonham v. Dresser Industries, above,
569 F.2d at 193.149

147 See comments of Harkin and Miller, AFL-CIO,

and Service Employees International Union (SEIU).
148 The Board has broad discretion to interpret
10(b), including equitable tolling, in accordance

with its experience administering the Act. Lodge 64,

IAM v. NLRB, 949 F.2d 441, 444 (D.C. Cir. 1991)
(deferring to the Board’s interpretation of 10(b)
equitable exceptions).

149 Under the final rule, the Board could also find
the failure to post the notice to be an unfair labor
practice, and could, if appropriate, consider a
willful failure to post to be evidence of unlawful
motive in an unfair labor practice case. However,

The Board received many comments
opposing this proposed rule provision.
Several comments assert that, when a
charging party is unaware of the facts
supporting the finding of an unfair labor
practice, the Board tolls the 10(b) period
only when the charged party has
fraudulently concealed those facts from
the charging party.15° That is not so.
The Board has long held, with court
approval, that the 10(b) period begins to
run only when the charging party has
notice that the NLRA has been violated.
The party asserting the 10(b) defense
has the burden to show such notice; it
may do so by showing that the charging
party had either actual or constructive
knowledge of the alleged unfair labor
practice prior to the 10(b) period. See,
e.g., Broadway Volkswagen, 342 NLRB
1244, 1246 (2004), enfd. sub nom. East
Bay Automotive Council v. NLEB, 483
F.2d 628, 634 (9th Cir. 2007); University
Moving & Storage Co., 350 NLRB 6, 7,
18 (2007); John Morrell & Co., above,
304 NLRB at 899; Pullman Building
Company, 251 NLRB 1048 (1980), enfd.
691 F.2d 507 (9th Cir. 1982) (table);
Burgess Construction, 227 NLRB 765,
766 (1977), enfd. 596 F.2d 378 (9th Cir.
1978), cert. denied 440 U.S. 940 (1979).
Knowledge may be imputed if the
charging party would have discovered
the unlawful conduct by exercising
reasonable or due diligence. Broadway
Volkswagen, above, 342 NLRB at 1246.
Certainly, the Board has found it
appropriate to toll the 10(b) period
when the charging party was excusably
unaware of the pertinent facts because
the charged party had fraudulently
concealed them; see, e.g., Burgess
Construction, above, 227 NLRB at 766;
but tolling is not limited to such
circumstances. Pullman Building
Company, above, 251 NLRB at 1048.

To the extent that the comments argue
that the Board should not engage in
equitable tolling of the 10(b) period
when an employer has merely failed to
post the notice but not engaged in
fraudulent concealment,151 the Board
disagrees. Fraudulent concealment
concerns a different kind of equitable
doctrine, and is not directly relevant to
the notice posting equitable tolling
doctrine hereby adopted. See Mercado,
above, 410 F.3d at 46-47 n.8 (employer
misconduct and equitable tolling

in the absence of equitable tolling of the 10(b)
period, such “redress” would not aid an employee
who was excusably unaware of his or her NLRA
rights, failed to file a timely charge, and thus was
denied any remedy for violation of those rights. Cf.
Kanakis Co., 293 NLRB 435, 436 fn. 10 (1989)
(possibility of criminal sanctions against employer
would be little comfort to charging party if deprived
of recourse to Board’s remedial processes).

doctrine form “two distinct lines of
cases applyl[ing] two distinct standards
to two distinct bases for equitable
tolling’).

Some comments argue that because
Section 10(b) contains a limited
exception to the 6-month filing period
for employees in the military, it is
improper for the Board to toll the 10(b)
period under other circumstances.15?
The Board rejects this argument as
foreclosed by the Supreme Court’s
holding in Zipes, above, and by the long
line of Board and court decisions
finding tolling of the 10(b) period
appropriate. In any event, the exception
in Section 10(b) for persons in the
military provides that if the aggrieved
person “was prevented from filing such
charge by reason of service in the armed
forces, in which event the six-month
period shall be computed from the day
of his discharge.’’ This provision does
not toll the six-month period during
armed service; rather, it states that the
six-month period begins at discharge.
See Holland v. Florida, 130 S.Ct. 2549,
2561 (2010) (rejecting argument that
explicit exceptions to time limits in
nonjurisdictional statute of limitations
precluded equitable tolling).15%

A number of comments contend that
tolling the 10(b) period is contrary to the
salutary purpose of statutes of
limitations in general, and 10(b) in
particular, which is “‘to require diligent
prosecution of known claims, thereby
providing finality and predictability in
legal affairs and ensuring that claims
will be resolved while evidence is
reasonably available and fresh.” 154
Black’s Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, at
1546. The Board recognizes that with
the passage of time evidence can be lost
and witnesses die, move away, or their
memories fade; it therefore will not
lightly find that the 10(b) period should
be tolled. However, like the courts
whose decisions are cited above, the
Board also recognizes that equitable
tolling is a fundamental part of the
statute of limitations, and that inequity
results from barring an individual from
seeking relief from a violation of his or
her NLRA rights where the individual
excusably was unaware of these rights.
After all, the purpose of a statute of
limitations is to “require diligent

152 See, e.g., comments of California Chamber and
NCAE.

153 American Bus Association v. Slater, 231 F. 3d
1 (D.C. Cir. 2000), cited by California Chamber and
NCAE, did not concern equitable tolling and is
therefore inapposite. The court there also found that
Congress had expressly limited the sanctions
available under the Americans with Disabilities Act
to those enumerated in that statute; such is not the
case under the NLRA.

Chamber of Commerce.
