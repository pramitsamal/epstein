entitled to deference under the analysis
set forth in Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Under
Chevron, where Congress has not
“directly addressed the precise question
at issue,”’ id. at 842-843, that
rulemaking authority may be used in
order “‘to fill any gap left, implicitly or
explicitly, by Congress.” Id. at 843.

Even assuming that the absence of an
explicit posting requirement in the
NLRA is not interpreted as clear
expression of Congressional intent, the
majority fails to persuade that Congress
delegated authority in Section 6 of the
NLRA for the Board to fill a putative
statutory gap by promulgating a rule
that an employer commits an unfair
labor practice by failing to affirmative
notify its employees of their rights
under the NLRA. As the Supreme Court
has explained, ‘the ultimate question is
whether Congress would have intended,
and expected, courts to treat [the
regulation] as within, or outside, its
delegation to the agency of ‘gap-filling’
authority.” Long Island Care at Home,
Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 173 (2007).

There is no doubt that there are many
gaps and ambiguities in the NLRA that
Congress intended for the Board to
address, using its labor expertise, either
through adjudication or rulemaking.
However, the existence of ambiguity in
a statute is not enough per se to warrant
deference to the agency’s interpretation
of its authority in every respect. The
ambiguity must be such as to make it
appear that Congress either explicitly or
implicitly delegated authority to cure
that ambiguity. Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC,
430 F.3d 457, 469 (D.C. Cir. 2005);
Motion Picture Ass’n of America, Inc. v.
FCC, 309 F. 3d 796, 801 (D.C. Cir. 2002)
(“MPAA ’’) (“agency’s interpretation of
[a] statute is not entitled to deference
absent a delegation of authority from
Congress to regulate in the areas at
issue.”’).

Thus, even when an administrative
agency seeks to address what it believes
is a serious interpretive problem, the
Supreme Court has said that the agency
“may not exercise its authority ‘in a
manner that is inconsistent with the
administrative structure that Congress
enacted into law.’’’ FDA v. Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S.
120, 125(2000) (quoting ETSI Pipeline
Project v. Missouri, 484 U.S. 495,
517(1988)). Further, the statute at issue
must be considered as a “symmetrical
and coherent regulatory scheme.”’
Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561,
569, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1
(1995). In our case, the exercise of
rulemaking authority under Section 6 is
not self-effectuating; it must be shown

to relate reasonably to some other
provision as part of the overall statutory
scheme contemplated by Congress.175

Nothing in the text or the regulatory
structure of the NLRA suggests that the
Board has the authority to promulgate
the notice-posting rule at issue in order
to address a gap in the statutory scheme
for resolving questions concerning
representation through Section 9, or in
preventing, through Sections 8 and 10,
specifically enumerated unfair labor
practices that adversely affect
employees’ Section 7 rights. On the
contrary, it is well-established that the
Board lacks independent authority to
initiate or to solicit the initiation of
representation and unfair labor practice
proceedings, and Section 10(a) limits
the Board’s powers to preventing only
the unfair labor practices listed in
Section 8 of the Act. Yet the majority
asserts that it may exceed these
limitations by requiring employers to
post a notice of employee rights and
illustrative unfair labor practices at all
times, regardless of whether a petition
had been filed or an employer has been
found to have committed an unfair labor
practice.

The majority’s reliance on a
combination of Section 7, 8, and 10
warrants special mention. They reason
that an employer interferes with Section
7 rights in general, and thereby violates
Section 8(a)(1), by failing to give
continuous notice to employees of those
rights. It may be a truism that an
employee must be aware of his rights in
order to exercise them, but it does not
follow that it is the employer under our
statutory scheme who must provide
enlightenment or else incur liability for
violating those rights. The new unfair
labor practice created by the rule bears
no reasonable relation to any unfair
labor practice in the NLRA’s pre-
existing enforcement scheme developed
over seven decades.!77 It certainly bears

176 See, e.g., Mourning v. Family Publications
Service, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, (1973) Unlike here, the
Federal Reserve Board easily met this standard in
Mourning when issuing a disclosure regulation
under the Truth in Lending Act, even though that
Act did not explicitly require lenders to make such
disclosures. In sustaining the regulation, the Court
ound the regulation to be within the Federal
Reserve’s rulemaking authority and, in light of the
egislative history, the disclosure requirement was
not contrary to the statute. ‘The crucial distinction,
* * * [was that] the disclosure requirement was in
act enforced through the statute’s pre-existing
remedial scheme and in a manner consistent with
it.” Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535
U.S. 81, 94 (2002).

177 The Senate report on the Wagner bill stressed
that unfair labor practices were “‘strictly limited to
those enumerated in section 8. This is made clear
by paragraph 8 of section 2, which provides that
‘The term ‘unfair labor practice’ means unfair labor
practice listed in Section 8,” and by Section 10(a)
empowering the Board to prevent any unfair labor

no relation to the few examples the
majority can muster in Board precedent.
The only instance with even a passing
resemblance to the rights notice-posting
requirement here is the requirement that
a union give notice of Beck 178 and
General Motors 17° rights. However, the
failure to give such a notice is not per
se unlawful. It becomes an unfair labor
practice only when a union, without
giving notice, takes the affirmative
action of seeking to obligate an
employee to pay fees and dues under a
union-security clause.18° Beyond that, a
union has no general obligation to give
employees notice of their Beck and
General Motors rights; much less does it
violate the NLRA by failing to do so. By
contrast, the rule promulgated today
imposes a continuing obligation on
employers to post notice of employees’
general rights and, even absent any
affirmative act involving those rights,
makes the failure to maintain such
notice unlawful.181

Unlike my colleagues, I find that the
Supreme Court’s opinion in Local 357,
Teamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961),
speaks directly to this point. In that
case, the Board found a hiring hall
agreement unlawfully discriminatory
per se because, even though it included
an express anti-discrimination

practice “listed in Section 8.” Thus, “[nJeither the
National Labor Relations Board nor the courts are
given any blanket authority to prohibit whatever
labor practices that in their judgment are deemed
to be unfair.” S. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.
17 (1935) at 8-9 reprinted in Legislative History of
the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, Vol. Hat
2307-2308 (1985).

178 Communications Workers v. Beck, 487 U.S.
735 (1988).

179 NLRB v. General Motors, 373 U.S. 734 (1963).

180 California Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224,
233 (1995).

181 None of the FMLA cases cited by the majority
support finding that a failure to post a general
notice of employee rights under the NLRA is
unlawful. In Bachelder, the Ninth Circuit actually
ound “unavailing” the employer’s argument that it
had satisfied all its specific FMLA notice
obligations because it had complied with the
FMLA’s general posting rule. Id. at 1127, In. 5.
Rather, the court found that because the employer
ailed to “notify” an employee which of the four
FMLA’s “leave year” calculation methods it had
chosen, the employer “interfered” with that
employee’s rights and, therefore, improperly used
he employee’s FMLA covered absences as a
“negative factor’ when taking the affirmative
adverse action of discharging her.

Similarly, in neither Greenwell v. Charles
Machine Works, Inc., 2011 WL 1458565 (W.D.Okla.,
2011); Smith v. Westchester County, 769 F. Supp 2d
448 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), was the FMLA general posting
requirement at issue. Smith did not involve a notice
issue and Greenwell involved the employer’s failure
to comply with a different notification obligation
under the FMLA.

In any event, as previously stated, FMLA
expressly provides that employers give notice to
employees of rights thereunder and expressly
provides for sanctions if notice is not given. The
NLRA does neither.
