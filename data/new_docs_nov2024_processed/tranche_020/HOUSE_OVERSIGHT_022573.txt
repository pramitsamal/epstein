Development Bank Group, and the World Bank Group
entered into an agreement under which entities debarred
by one MDB will be sanctioned for the same misconduct
by other signatory MDBs.*” This cross-debarment agree-

is debarred by all>”

Loss of Export Privileges

Companies and individuals who violate the FCPA
may face consequences under other regulatory regimes,
such as the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C.
§ 2751, et seqg., and its implementing regulations, the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22
C.ER. § 120, e¢ seg. AECA and ITAR together provide
for the suspension, revocation, amendment, or denial of an
arms export license ifan applicant has been indicted or con-
victed for violating the FCPA.*” They also set forth certain
factors for the Department of State’s Directorate of Defense
Trade Controls (DDTC)*” to consider when determining
whether to grant, deny, or return without action license
applications for certain types of defense materials. One of
those factors is whether there is reasonable cause to believe
that an applicant for a license has violated (or conspired
to violate) the FCPA; if so, the Department of State “may
disapprove the application.”>” In addition, it is the policy
of the Department of State not to consider applications for
licenses involving any persons who have been convicted of
violating the AECA or convicted of conspiracy to violate
the AECA.*” In an action related to the criminal resolu-
tion of a UK. military products manufacturer, the DDTC
imposed a “policy of denial” for export licenses on three of
the company’s subsidiaries that were involved in violations

of AECA and ITAR.*”

When Is a Compliance Monitor or
Independent Consultant Appropriate?
One of the primary goals of both criminal prosecu-
tions and civil enforcement actions against companies that
violate the FCPA is ensuring that such conduct does not

occur again. As a consequence, enhanced compliance and

reporting requirements may be part of criminal and civil
resolutions of FCPA matters. The amount of enhanced
compliance and kind of reporting required varies according
to the facts and circumstances of individual cases.

In criminal cases, a company’s sentence, or a DPA or
NPA with a company, may require the appointment of an
independent corporate monitor. Whether a monitor is
appropriate depends on the specific facts and circumstances
of the case. In 2008, DOJ issued internal guidance regard-
ing the selection and use of corporate monitors in DPAs
and NPAs with companies. Additional guidance has since
been issued.” A monitor is an independent third party who
assesses and monitors a company’s adherence to the com-
pliance requirements of an agreement that was designed to
reduce the risk of recurrence of the company’s misconduct.
Appointment of a monitor is not appropriate in all circum-
stances, but it may be appropriate, for example, where a com-
pany does not already have an effective internal compliance
program or needs to establish necessary internal controls. In
addition, companies are sometimes allowed to engage in self-
monitoring, typically in cases when the company has made
a voluntary disclosure, has been fully cooperative, and has

demonstrated a genuine commitment to reform.

Factors DOJ and SEC Consider
When Determining Whether a Compliance
Monitor Is Appropriate Include:

= Seriousness of the offense
= Duration of the misconduct

  Pervasiveness of the misconduct, including
whether the conduct cuts across geographic and/
or product lines

# Nature and size of the company

 Quality of the company’s compliance program at
the time of the misconduct

# Subsequent remediation efforts
