86'The phrase “anything of value” is not defined in the FCPA, but the
identical phrase under the domestic bribery statute has been broadly
construed to include both tangible and intangible benefits. See, £5
United States v. Moore, 525 F.3d 1033, 1048 (11th Cir. 2008) (rejecting
defendant’s objection to instruction defining sex asa “thing of value?
which “unambiguously covers intangible considerations”); United
States v. Gorman, 807 F.2d 1299, 1304-05 (6th Cir. 1986) (holding that
loans and promises of future employment are “things of value”); United
States v. Williams, 705 F.2d 603, 622-23 (2d Cir. 1983) (approving jury
instruction that stock could be a “thing of value” if defendant believed it
had value, even though the shares had no commercial value, and noting
that “[t]he phrase ‘anything of value’ in bribery and related statutes has
consistently been given a broad meaning”).
87 Section 30A(a), 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1(a); 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2(a), 78dd-
3{a) (emphasis added).
88 Like the FCPA, the domestic bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201, prohibits

Endnotes

giving, offering, or promising “anything of value.” Numerous domestic
bribery cases under Section 201 have involved “small” dollar bribes.

See, 6.85 United States v. Franco, 632 F.3d 880, 882-84 (Sth Cir. 2011)
(affirming bribery convictions of inmate for paying correctional officer
$325 to obtain cell phone, food, and marijuana, and noting that 18
US.C. § 201 does not contain minimum monetary threshold); United
States v. Williams, 216 F.3d 1099, 1103 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (affirming
bribery conviction for $70 bribe to vehicle inspector); United States v.
Traitz, 871 F.2d 368, 396 (3rd Cir 1989) (affirming bribery conviction
for $100 bribe paid to official of Occupational Health and Safety
Administration); United States v. Hsieh Hui Mei Chen, 754 F.2d 817,
822 (9th Cir. 1985) (affirming bribery convictions including $100 bribe
to immigration official); United States v. Bishton, 463 F.2d 887, 889
(D.C. Cir. 1972) (afirming bribery conviction for $100 bribe to division
chief of District of Columbia Sewer Operations Division).
