Hello Martin,

Thank you for getting back to me. We would be looking for on record comments or a no comment to our
questions. But | am certainly happy to have an off record conversation with yourself as well. Perhaps we
could set up a time to chat briefly off record on Monday before | send you our questions for Mr Epstein?

Kind regards,
Matt
