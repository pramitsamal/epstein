Last fall’s allegations of sexual assault against President Donald Trump failed to stop his
presidency, but one of the more explosive of those allegations is once again making headlines.
POLITICO reported that a new lawsuit reveals details linking Trump to billionaire
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. The reports indicate that one lawsuit
contains information about Virginia Giuffre who alleges that she met Epstein while working as
a towel girl at Mar-a-Lago when she was 15 before being recruited into “sexual slavery”.
