Giuffre’s case is set to appear before a judge on May 15, and although her accusations against
Epstein have been public for some time, this is the first time the detail about her employment
at Mar-a-Lago has been included.

Last summer, the Trump-Epstein connection made headlines when Trump was slated to win
the Republican nomination, and just before the election, a woman came forward alleging that
Trump raped her when she was 13 at one of Epstein’s parties — only to drop suit a few days
later.

In 2015, Trump lawyers denied claims of the then-candidate’s involvement with Epstein by
saying their only relation was that Epstein was “one of thousands of people who has visited
Mar-a-Lago”. Those claims that fly in the face of a 2002 New York Magazine interview in
which Trump claimed to have known Epstein for 15 years.

“He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and

many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life,”
Trump told reporters.
