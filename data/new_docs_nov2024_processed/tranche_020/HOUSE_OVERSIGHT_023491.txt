Yes, Nukes: The Global Zero Utopia

Richard Perle

March/April 2011 -- There are many specters haunting our world, but
one is of our own making—the utopian vision of a world free of
nuclear weapons, the dream that has come to be called “global zero.”
The vision of the total elimination of nuclear weapons is a
postmodern version of an old idea, popular early in the twentieth
century, when Norman Angell’s The Great Illusion (reprinted in
1933) was required reading in intellectual and policy circles in the
United States and Europe. Seventy-six years before Barack Obama
was honored in Oslo, Norman Angell also won the Nobel Prize,
having come to prominence with the argument that global economic
interdependence rendered war futile and unprofitable and therefore
obsolete.

In the wake of the Bush administration, what lies in store for the
future of America's presence abroad?

Angell’s theory expressed the war-weary and wishful temper of the
time. Enthusiasm for achieving peace through international
institutions and legal constructs ran high in the period after the
disastrous First World War, its most fulsome expression being the
Kellogg-Briand Pact, named for its authors, an American secretary of
state and a French foreign minister. Ratified by parliaments around
the world (and by the US Senate on an 85-1 vote, with only
Wisconsin Republican John J. Blaine voting against), the pact sought
to deal with the problem of international aggression by simply
outlawing war. Less than two years after the pact entered into force in
1929, one of the signatories, Japan, invaded Manchuria. The world
“community’—that is, the rest of the treaty parties—did nothing.
