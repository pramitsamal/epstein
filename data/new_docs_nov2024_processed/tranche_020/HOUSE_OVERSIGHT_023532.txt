done something bold: Acknowledge that the age of Jewish settlement
is over. He did mention, fleetingly, that certain settlements would be
set adrift in a theoretical peace deal. But he seemed unaware that he
was delivering a speech that could easily have been given 10 years
ago.

It is not 10 years ago. Israel is now 10 years closer to achieving full
pariah status. And -- in part because the Palestinians lack the patience
to pursue a strategy of gradual, irreversible entanglement -- a moment
of truth for Israel is rapidly approaching.

UN Vote

The Palestinians are seeking a UN vote in September on
independence. They will prevail in the General Assembly, though not
in the Security Council. President Barack Obama, with whom
Netanyahu just picked a fight, will have to spend a good amount of
political capital to stymie the Palestinian campaign, even though he
appears to have nothing but contempt for Netanyahu’s lack of vision.
But American opposition to this unilateral declaration will be in
many ways immaterial. Israel will soon enough be seen by most of
the world as the occupier not of disputed territory but of a foreign
country. The Palestinians will wake up to find that a General
Assembly vote did not, in fact, give them true independence. And
then there will be an explosion.

The Palestinians who are watching Yemenis, Libyans and Syrians
fighting for their freedom will soon be inspired to once again take up
their own fight.

Existential Threats

Netanyahu, who understands the existential threat posed by Iran, does
not seem to understand the nature of this other existential threat. His
five predecessors as prime minister -- including Ariel Sharon, whose
heart did not bleed for Palestinians -- understood it. President Obama
understands it, too.
