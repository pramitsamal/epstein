President Xi, China, Economy
Robert Lawrence Kuhn — March 5, 2018

HOST: You were there at the Great Hall of the People. What was
your main takeaway from what some have described as Li

Keqiang’s impossible challenge: how to deleverage, how to take
away stimulus, and still keep 6.5% growth?

RLK: I don’t take the 6.5% growth as the primary objective here.

Congresses are. They’re not setting the vision and the strategy.
That was set at the party congress in October. What we're dealing
here is the implementation of the policies. If you attend these
every year you know they all look and sound the same because
it’s the same structure, same kind of structure of numbers, so
what you do is look for the differences. What are those subtle
differences between one year and another. That’s what I focus on
at these congresses.

HOST: What’s the main difference you saw?
