Young woman: Good judgment.

Interviewer: Any specifics?

Young woman: I think she would control the out-of-control
spending.

Young woman: I think she would acknowledge the system of
government in the United States rather than focus on the
administration of czars.

Interviewer: Yeah, and what is your problem with czars?

Young woman: I’m an American and we don’t have czars in
America.

Here again, we have a juxtaposition of beliefs based on no actual evi-
dence or reality. I don’t know what this woman has heard about czars,
but whatever it is, it misses the point. Could we teach this woman to
be on point—to say meaningful things based on actual evidence? Not
now, I fear, but it is my contention that we could have done so at some
point in her life. School has failed her and she seems, to anyone listen-
ing, to be stupid. But she is not really stupid; she is just talking stu-
pidly because she hasn’t been challenged to behave in any other way.
Here is another:

Middle-aged woman: Governor of Alaska is the only one that has
top security.

Interviewer: What does that mean?

Middle-aged woman: It means that if anything happens to our
borders on that side, she’s the first one in line for attack for
there.

This person not only makes no sense, but she can’t speak in an under-
standable way. Is that genetic? I doubt it. Intelligence, as it is popularly
defined, includes the ability to produce coherent speech, which cer-
tainly can be enhanced through teaching, but apparently not by our
schools as they currently exist.

Here is one last interview from that event:

Interviewer: What do you think of foreign policy—what would
you like to see her do with foreign policy?

Man with cap: I don’t know, I really don’t have an answer—I
don’t know her well enough. I don’t know what she knows or
doesn’t know. I don’t know some stuff of what people ask me.
