CHAPTER 11

Restructuring the University

It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.
—Albert Einstein

When I moved from Stanford to Yale, it was entirely because of the
efforts of Bob Abelson, a psychology professor who became my good
friend and wonderful colleague during the 15 years I was at Yale. Bob
had been instrumental in helping to create the Computer Science
Department at Yale, which is the department that wound up recruit-
ing me( Bob had hoped I would be outside the department structure
since I didn’t really fit in anywhere very well, but he couldn’t win that
argument.)

Bob told me a story about the creation of the Computer Science
Department at Yale, which involved his having to argue with another
faculty member on a university committee about why a department
should be created around a machine. He said that one member of the
committee actually asked him whether there should be a department
of lathe science as well.

We both found this to be pretty funny at the time. Now, however,
I have to admit that the guy had a point.

I have been a professor in quite a few academic departments in
my university career: linguistics, computer science, psychology, edu-
cation, and electrical engineering. These departments all have some
something in common: They have no real reason to exist. One would
assume that departments represent academic disciplines that are co-
herent in some way, but it simply isn’t so. The people in a computer
science department, for example, have in common that they all think
about computer-related issues, but so do people in other disciplines.
Some parts of computer science have more in common with math-
ematics than they do with other parts of computer science. There were
many people in the departments that I was in who worked on things
that I didn’t understand or care about. All our interchanges were about
