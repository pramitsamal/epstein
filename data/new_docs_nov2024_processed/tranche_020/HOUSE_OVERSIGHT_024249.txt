have—many obviously hope—the effect of derailing the
Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.

It is a curious attribute of his character that, other
than perhaps being more circumspect about what legal
advice to follow, Epstein would have done little
differently. (When I suggested recently to Epstein that
one obvious way to blunt the animus bearing down on
him would be to get married, he said he’d rather go back
to jail.) His life, living it as he wants, seems to him to be
an extraordinary accomplishment. Being on the wrong
side of morality, custom, politics, feminists, the media,
that’s just a bit of bad luck.

And it is perhaps this attitude of his that irks his
critics the most. Although he has spent more than a year
in jail and paid out what may be as much as $20 million,
he yet seems somehow to have gotten away with it—
that worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catchall of
up-to-the-minute badness: the financier whose wealth is
a product of Wall Street math rather than work; a rich
middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth
and entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an
insistent playboy (excuse me, pedophile) in a correct
and prudish world—someone who somehow didn’t get
the memo about vast changes in mores and culture.

But Epstein’s friends—and I think that is, in the
end, the best word for the powerful people who orbit
him—are willing to take him as he comes. Epstein is
their confidant. Not the only nexus of them, but one of
them. Dr. Epstein. Lay on my couch. As he is
