Bannon joins a growing list of political figures associated with President Trump who have
been confronted in public in recent weeks.

Protesters in Kentucky followed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to his
car while he was leaving a Louisville restaurant on Saturday, threatening to vote him out of
office.

Others, including White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Department of
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, also have been confronted by protesters for
their association with the Trump administration and its policies.
