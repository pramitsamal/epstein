of conduct for the Board of Directors, the corporate governance guidelines and the criteria set forth above for director nominees. Moreover, each director
possesses the following critical personal qualities and attributes that we believe are essential for the proper functioning of the Board to allow it to fulfill its
duties for our stockholders: accountability, ethical leadership, governance, integrity, risk management, and sound business judgment. In addition, our
directors have the mature confidence to assess and challenge the way things are done and recommend alternative solutions, a keen awareness of our
business and the social realities of the environment in which we operate, the independence and high-performance standards necessary to fulfill the Board’s
oversight function, and the humility, professional maturity, and style to interface openly and constructively with other directors. Finally, the director
biographies below include a non-exclusive list of other key experiences and qualifications that further qualify the individual to serve on the Board. These
collective qualities, skills, experiences, and attributes are essential to our Board’s ability to exercise its oversight function for Carvana and its stockholders
and to guide the long-term sustainable, dependable performance of our business.

Subject to any earlier resignation or removal in accordance with the terms of our certificate and bylaws, our Class II directors will serve until
this our second annual meeting of stockholders, our Class III directors will serve until the third annual meeting of stockholders, and our Class I directors
will serve until our fourth annual meeting of stockholders. In addition, our certificate provides that our directors may be removed with or without cause by
the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, for
so long as the Garcia Parties are entitled to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock they hold. If the Garcia Parties are no longer entitled to ten
votes for each share of Class B common stock they hold, then our directors may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 % of
the voting power of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon.
