KEY COMPENSATION DESIGN AND DECISIONS TO LINK PAY AND PERFORMANCE

Underlying our executive compensation program is a strong belief in promoting a pay-for-performance culture. We accomplish this by linking

a significant portion of the compensation of our executive officers, including our named executive officers, to our performance. In addition, the
Compensation and Nomination Committee seeks to set challenging threshold and target performance levels that reflect our rapid growth trajectory and
business plans rather than goals based on prior years’ achievements. For each of the metrics used in our performance-based compensation plans, payouts are
eared based upon outstanding performance as measured against pre-established financial objectives.
