Are Qadhafi and other deposed leaders deluded in thinking all is
well in their kingdom or their country?

Deluded isn't quite the word, because if you're surrounded by a group
of sycophants who tell you what you want to hear, not what you need
to hear, you can be in touch with reality by psychological tests but
quite out of touch with reality politically. With Saddam Hussein, this
was particularly true—where to provide criticism of him was either to
lose your job or lose your life. Everyone was constantly praising him
and his brilliance, and he was spared wise council.

In addition to these circles of sycophants, is narcissism a common
trait among autocrats?

That is a wonderful question. I'm just putting the finishing touches on
my capstone book, which will be called Dreams of Glory: Narcissism
and Politics. | see narcissism as being a very powerful explanatory
factor for many of these leaders, who display a number of traits of
narcissism. One is they have a really exalted self-concept on the
surface, and are very sensitive to slight or any information to the
contrary. So they can get very angry if someone questions them.
Secondly, when there is something that shatters that image—and this
will be interesting to see what happens with Qadhafi—there can be
what's called a narcissistic rage. So, for example, with Saddam
Hussein as he was exiting Kuwait, lighting the oil wells on fire—that
was probably an example of that. Their interpersonal relationships
are very disturbed, and they surround themselves with people who
make them feel good. So that it is really a great hazard to in any way
criticize the leader. Qadhafi did a great deal to hollow out the
