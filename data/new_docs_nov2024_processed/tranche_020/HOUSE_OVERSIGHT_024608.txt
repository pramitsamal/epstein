and regain its full rights. Egypt's new government has made tentative
steps in that direction: Members of the Supreme Council of the
Armed Forces, accompanied by the deputy interior minister and
members of the military intelligence, held a meeting on Aug. 20 in
the el-Arish military club, in a conference hall with Bedouin sheikhs
representing each tribe in Sinai. At the meeting speakers from both
sides expressed their willingness to cooperate in bringing the security
situation back to normal and to bury the hatchet for love of Sinai.
The government officials announced their concessions, including
promises to soon issue a new law regarding land ownership in the
region and to revisit the files of those Bedouins sentenced in absentia;
the Bedouins dutifully clapped at the news. Several Bedouin sheikhs
subsequently took to the podium and announced their intentions to
assist in securing the region.

The government's planned reforms are a good start, but after years of
neglect, it's going to take more than promises to win over the
Bedouins. If Egypt is truly concerned about securing Sinai, it must
quickly turn its words into actions.
