Nations General Assembly which issued in November 26, 1947 a
resolution dividing Palestine into two states: A Jewish state
consisting of 54 percent of the territory of Palestine, an Arab state
consisting of 44 percent of that territory, and the Jerusalem Area, as a
Corpus Separatum, consisting of 2 percent of Palestine.
Furthermore, the Resolution decided to have an Economic Union
between the two states and stipulated that the Jerusalem Area, which
included Bethlehem, should be a separate area under the control of
the UN.

The Zionist leadership pretended to accept the resolution, relying on
the fact that it would be refused by the reactionary Arab leadership.
After the UN Resolution, clashes broke out among the two
communities. The armed Zionist organizations, well prepared and
organized, as well as heavily armed, defeated the poorly armed
Palestinians and the weak unorganized Arab armies.

They occupied and annexed 70 percent of Jerusalem and 50 percent
of the territory allocated to the Arab State, and on May 15, 1948,
declared the State of Israel on 78 percent of historical Palestine
territory, leaving the Palestinians without a state and in limbo.

All these events happened in collusion among the colonial British
government, the Jewish Agency and some Arab regimes, ruled and/or
controlled by the British.

Aftermath of the 1948 War

As mentioned above, there was an enlarged Jewish state [Israel], but
the remaining territories of Palestine were either annexed to Jordan
[The West Bank], or put under Egyptian rule [The Gaza Strip].

So, the Palestinian people, who constituted 67 percent of the
population of Palestine in 1947 and owned 93 percent of its land,
were betrayed and left in a state of destitution.

Sixty-two percent of them were driven out of their home under
gunpoint and in several massacres committed by armed Zionist
