be granted the status of Observer in all UN organs and affiliated
organizations and its sponsored conferences.

In December 15, 1988, a month after the declaration of the State of
Palestine by the PLO conference in Algiers, the UN General
Assembly decided in its resolution of December 15, 1988 to
recognize the PLO declaration of the State of Palestine and to
substitute the use of PLO for the name of Palestine in all its organs

some of its allies.

state: That is the effective control over territory and population.
This can only be achieved when the Israeli occupation is compelled
