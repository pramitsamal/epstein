Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

Comparison of Canadian Stock Markets

Similar to stock markets in the United States, Canadian stock markets vary significantly in terms
of their financial, liquidity and corporate governance requirements. Most Canadian publicly traded
cannabis-related companies trade on the CSE due to its less stringent requirements, as compared to the
TSX and TSXV. More than 10% of the companies traded on the CSE are cannabis-related companies.
The following chart provides a comparison of the TSX, TSXV and CSE.
