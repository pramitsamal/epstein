States for offering direct dialogue with North Korea while refusing
talks with Iran “without preconditions.”

He goes on to say that Washington does not seem to understand the
actual causes of proliferation, which he writes “were rooted much
deeper, in the extreme economic and social inequalities that prevailed
between North and South . . . and the conflicts and tensions that
continued to fester in specific regions.” Those tensions certainly lead
to proliferation, but “economic and social inequalities” have no
detectable bearing on why Libya, North Korea, Pakistan, India, Iran,
Syria and Israel have pursued nuclear programs.

ElBaradei passionately advocates making diplomacy the main
recourse in counterproliferation — and he’s right to do so. But when
he argues that “the increasing distrust between different cultures”
form the barrier to “an enduring and collective security” he’s on
shaky ground.

His credo is diplomacy above all else, for however long it takes and
whatever the risk that nuclear weapons will be built in the meantime.
He exhibits more sympathy for non-Western proliferators and their
needs than for the major powers and their security and political
concerns. At times, his narrative comes close to condoning the
motives of states that seek nuclear weapons. “Iran’s goal is not to
become another North Korea — a nuclear weapons possessor but a
pariah in the international community — but rather Brazil or Japan, a
technological powerhouse with the capacity to develop nuclear
weapons if the political winds were to shift, while remaining a
nonnuclear weapons state,” he writes. As for Iran’s concealing its
nuclear program at Natanz, he says Iran “was not intending to ‘hide’

proliferation can’t succeed unless the established nuclear powers
(above all, America and Russia) reduce their stockpiles and move
