Although in the tourism sector there is an evident possibility of making money in Cuba,
it’s doubtful that the North American hotel industry, almost all present on the Stock
Exchange, subject to North American legislation and union pressure, would lend itself to
collaborating with the Cuban counter-intelligence by facilitating eavesdropping/wire-
tapping and clandestine filming inside hotel installations, such as today occurs in Melia
and other European chains, violating even Cuban law which supposedly defends the
inviolability of privacy. American lawyers are very clear about the high price German
companies had to pay when they associated themselves with Nazism, as occurred with
Volkswagen and Bayer.

Even though this is not a matter of investing in a country living under a dictatorship, but
rather of associating oneself with a dictatorial government in order to exploit workers
and companies, it’s very possible that, whenever the opportunity presents itself, those
businessmen linked to the Cuban government are going to be accused in court because
of the confiscation of 94% of the salary through the exchange of dollars for pesos and
other violations of the rules of the International Labor Organization. Workers’ claims
will be very high, and there are American law firms willing to bring them in exchange for
a percentage of whatever is eventually received.

Lastly, two articles of the Cuban constitution profile the inflexibly Communist nature of
the regime, and become a permanent threat against foreign investors. Article 5: The
Communist Party of Cuba, Marti-inspired and Marxist-Leninist, organized vanguard of
the Cuban nation, is the superior directing force of society and the State. Article 62:
None of the liberties recognized to citizens may be exercised against what is established
in the Constitution and laws, or against the decision of the Cuban people to build
socialism and communism. The violation of this principle is punishable.
