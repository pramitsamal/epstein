Japanese equities

Preference: neutral

Topix (24 Oct): 743 (last publication: 743)

UBS view Topix (6-month target): 756

e We expect earnings growth of about 25% over the upcoming 12 months. A relatively high growth rate
still reflects last year's sharp decline caused by two natural disasters. Still, the earnings recovery has
disappointed so far. Earnings growth continues to slow down and is expected to move toward a more
normal single-digit growth in 2013.

¢ The government started implementing its JPY 18 trillion recovery budget in Q4 2011; we expect it to
boost GDP by 0.5-1.0% in FY2012, and about 0.5% in 2013.

e However, we see only limited scope for an additional earnings boost from the local economic recovery.
Slowing export markets also curtail the outlook. June quarter-earnings results revealed emerging market
demand was below expectation, capping earnings growth.

e We expect the TOPIX trailing P/E to drop to around 13.5x from 15.0x over the coming months, mainly due
to the earnings recovery; this provides room for moderate price increases only.

A Positive scenario Topix (6-month target): 970

¢ Stronger global demand and stabilizing European markets lead to improved risk-taking. Falling risk
aversion is likely to lead to a weaker yen, providing an additional increase in earnings. We expect 10-15%
EPS growth in FY2013 and the TOPIX target is based on 16.0x trailing P/E.

& Negative scenario Topix (6-month target): 575

¢ Faltering global growth leads to weak exports, triggering negative earnings surprises. USD-JPY rate
strengthening to below 75 and potential economic conflicts with China might serve as an additional drag

on earnings. We would then expect the P/E ratio to contract to 13.0x and earnings to fall during the
upcoming six months.

What we're watching Why it matters

JPY and exports The exchange rate is an important factor for the Japanese equity market. Japan’s

trade balance could be in deficit and may impact USD-JPY rates. Key date: Nov
21, Japanese trade balance

BoJ’s monetary policy

If the Bank of Japan makes additional commitments to its asset-purchase
board meeting

program, which is currently JPY 70 trillion in size, it would lead to a weaker yen,
in our view. Key date: Oct 30, BoJ policy meeting

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e Japanese value stocks have under-
performed growth stocks by more than
20% for the last four months. We see this
as an overreaction to concerns on the
slower global economy, and recommend
picking some value stocks with high
dividend yields.

We prefer companies that are using cost-
reduction initiatives to maintain price
competitiveness during periods of yen
strength.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e A weaker USD-JPY rate may drive
Japanese companies’ earnings recovery
beyond a technical recovery from natural
disasters. Japanese exporters and
companies owning international
operations would benefit from such a
development.

Japanese realized earnings likely to
recover further going forward
