As Bitcoin Ownership is Not Anonymous, Illicit Use has Fallen _ Division

Larry Fink on Bitcoin’s Illicit Use

Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money
laundering there is in the world. That’: all it is. It's an

index of money laundering.”

— BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, October 13, 2017

= Because bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous, users’ real-world identities are ascertainable once the individual
converts bitcoin to fiat currency.

= Digital intelligence companies continually scan the blockchain to identify suspicious transaction activity.

 The Blockchain Intelligence Group estimates that illegal transactions in bitcoin fell from ~50% of total volume in 2015
to ~20% in 2016, and represent “significantly less than that” today.

= As law enforcement has become better able to track bitcoin ransom, cybercriminals have begun to favor currencies that
allow anonymity, such as Monero and Zcash, and even Ether.
