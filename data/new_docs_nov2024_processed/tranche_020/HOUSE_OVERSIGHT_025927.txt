I openly and proudly support Trump.

I've actually been able to pull people away from Hillary by saying I'd ONLY vote for Trump or Sanders.
Citing they everyone else is establishment politics. I convinced a lesbian woman, older, to consider Trump
after she went on a rampage about him. It just shows, people HAVE NO IDEA what they are talking about.
Media holds the cards.... people are sheep.
