Ukrsib bank

I have considered a number of banks (Appendix I) and given my experience in the
country, Ukrsib is my top choice for the following reasons:

«= Image of a European reliable, ethical, healthy bank with good electronic
banking solutions (Top 5 in 2017) servicing first class corporate customers and
their employees. The shareholders comprise BNP Paribas (60%) and EBRD
(40%).

= Good coverage ratio of problematic loans, a practice of French banks we have
observed in many occasions with recent experience in Greece with Credit
Agricole and Soc Gen.

The NPL ratio is 31% (EUR 301 million), less than the 36.4% average for
banks with foreign capital, and coverage of around 80%. From the 2016 audited
annual accounts, the remaining 20% net of reserves NPL portfolio is covered 4
times by collateral. The most problematic loans population has been that of
mortgages in foreign currency and it seems that Ukrsib has provisioned this part
adequately.
