And now Kochavi has purchased the services of President Obama’s former White House counsel, Ruemmler,
whose name was once on the shortlist<http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ruemmler-attorney-general-nixed-
20141024-story.html> for US attorney general. It’s a fair question to ask: why was Ruemmler really down in
local DC court on a Saturday morning? Why was getting this Vocativ employee off the hook such a high
priority? And what, if any, other services has Ruemmler, the corporate crime expert, been providing to Kochavi
and his various intelligence operations around the world?

Ruemmler herself has not returned requests for comment.

More than 200 people are being charged with felony rioting — a charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10
years in jail — after they were arrested during anti-Trump demonstrations on Inauguration Day in DC.
