Due to the lower capitalisation of local stock and
bond markets, economic performance in DM Low
FME countries is relatively less vulnerable to financial
shocks than in DM High FME markets, giving Low FME
central banks greater freedom to invest in higher risk
asset classes. Furthermore, whereas most High FME
central banks self-assess ‘ample’ reserves adequacy,
the majority of Low FME central bank respondents
describe reserve levels as ‘sufficient’, and are
therefore more likely to seek higher returns through
the investment tranche to improve their long-term
reserves adequacy position (figure 31).

Typically, emerging market central banks have the
lowest levels of reserves adequacy due in large part to
greater vulnerability to foreign shocks. Indeed, certain
emerging market central banks with a currency peg
noted that falling commodity prices had created
pressure on the local currency, causing a drawdown
of foreign reserves to maintain the peg. Countries
with more flexible exchange rate arrangements are
instead seeking greater exposure to risk asset classes
to generate positive returns to preserve capital and
maintain reserves adequacy.
