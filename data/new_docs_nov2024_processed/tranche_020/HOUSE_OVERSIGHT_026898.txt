3.2% (i.e. the cost of borrowing). Stocks typically struggle when the cost of borrowing exceeds the
nominal growth of the economy (see Exhibit 4). Second, the recent backup in interest rates was
driven primarily by improving real growth expectations, not higher inflation. This distinction is critical,
because higher rates in response to improving real growth tend to benefit earnings sufficiently to
overcome the downward pressure they place on valuation multiples. Finally, it will take a number of
years before higher rates meaningfully impact aggregate S&P 500 interest expense, considering 91%
of S&P 500 debt is fixed-rate and only 13% matures over the next two years.

Low Probability of Recession

We continue to maintain a low, 10%, probability of recession driven by:
e The positive trend of leading economic indicators
e Low levels of inflation

e The continued slow but steady pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. We believe that
Federal Reserve Chairman Powell’s recent commentary indicates that the FOMC will continue to be
driven by data and financial market conditions. Their stated goal is to extend this expansion
“indefinitely.” While the Federal Reserve dots point towards four more interest rate hikes by the end
of 2019, we do not think that such hikes materially increase the odds of a recession in an economy
that continues to grow at levels that are generally regarded as above trend growth in the US.
