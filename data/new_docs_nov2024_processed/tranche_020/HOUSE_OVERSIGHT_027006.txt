open-ended autonomous learning and language
acquisition.

Integration of perception and action. Environmental
interaction is (at least partially) a control process that
requires a modeling of the relationship between sensory
data and operations performed by the system.

(Semi-) Universal problem solving, enabling paradigms
of learning, planning, reasoning, analogies, language
acquisition and reflection.

A structured memory, including provisions for a
world /situation model, a protocol of environmental
interactions, procedural memory, declarative and
typological abstractions, a model of self, and a ‘mental
stage’, to facilitate anticipation and planning.

Decision making and motivational mechanisms, to
address both autonomous, goal-directed cognition in
complex, open domains, and the genesis of goals and
intentions.

The direction and modulation of attention, and the
emergence of emotion and affect, which are
configurational aspects of cognition that either reflect the
allocation of cognitive resources, or structure social
interaction.

Constraints for Mental Representations

Based on the emergent paradigm of a new generation of

cognitive architectures, we can think about mental

representations in a new and productive way. More specifically,

we know that mental representations include perceptual and

propositional/conceptual content and we are aware of many

constraints. Mental representations must

Offer support for both connectionist and symbolic
processing (including compositionality and grammatical
structures), with the latter one being a special case of the
former

Possess a hierarchical structure, bottoming out in
sensory perception

Cover prototypes, individuals and abstractions

Include perceptual and relational features, objects,
situations, and episodic knowledge

Allow simulation of dynamic processes

Solve the bridge problem between fuzzy associative
hierarchies and the discrete symbol strings of natural
language
