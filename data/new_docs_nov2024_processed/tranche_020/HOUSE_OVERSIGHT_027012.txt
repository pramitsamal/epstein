e It is no secret, and I'll repeat it again, that we
live in a tough neighborhood, where there is no
mercy for the weak. And no second chance for
those who cannot defend themselves.

e Israel is the strongest country in the region and
the only genuinely open democracy.

e An unprecedented geopolitical earthquake in
the last three years has shattered the
generations’ old regional order.

e There are two clear lessons and one insight
which I have drawn from this period:

e #1: Be modest with predictions....... especially
about the future! Take Egypt as an example;
Mubarak was unable to predict it... who did?
Who thinks he could?

e #2: When friends tell me: Don’t worry... If
worse comes to worst ... the world will step
forward and act!
