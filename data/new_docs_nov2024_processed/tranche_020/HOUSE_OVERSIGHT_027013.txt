My answer is: Do not take this for granted.

Look at Syria — you don't need classified
intelligence; it’s on your screens. Assad’s jet
fighters, tanks and artillery are slaughtering his
own citizens. Over 70,000 Syrians killed.

Yet still... there is no sense of direction and no
political will to act.

There is an extremely relevant lesson here...
especially for all of us in Israel.

And an insight...

Many believe that the root cause for all the
problems in the Middle East... is our inability to
solve the conflict with the Palestinians.

Well, | say... That’s not true!

Recent developments in the Middle East have
been far beyond our control... and
independent of our deeds.

Even if a peace agreement with the Palestinians
had been signed and sealed a long time ago:
