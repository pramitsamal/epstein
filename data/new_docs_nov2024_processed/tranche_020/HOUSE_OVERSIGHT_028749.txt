states, such as Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. I think it is likely to happen
before too long.

TB: What about Syria?

DP: Assad’s power is steadily diminishing and I cannot see how his
regime will remain long in power.

TB: Should the United States get involved there?

DP: No, Americans have no dog in this fight and nothing in the U.S.
Constitution requires us to get involved in every foreign conflict. Two
wretched forces are killing each other; just look at the ghastly videos of
the two sides torturing and executing the other. Listen also to what they
are saying. It’s a civil war involving the bad and the worse. I don’t want
the U.S. government involved. That would mean bearing some moral
responsibility for what emerges, which I expect to be very unsavory.

TB: So you are supporting the Obama position?

DP: Yes, though he reaches it with far more angst. Also, there appears to
be some serious, clandestine U.S. support for the rebel forces. The
September 11 meeting in Benghazi between the Turkish and the American
ambassadors was very curious. They are both based in Tripoli, hundreds
of miles away. What were they doing in Benghazi? Arranging for
American arms going via Turkey to Syria, 1t appears.

TB: How important has Israel been to the revival of Islam?

DP: It is a major factor in the neighboring states. But elsewhere, in
Morocco, Iran, Malaysia, it has minor importance.

TB: Since the “Arab Spring,” Israel seems increasingly beleaguered.
DP: Not really, not yet, though I agree that it will be more beleaguered
with time. Its neighbors are so consumed with their own affairs that they
hardly pay Israel attention. But once the neighbors get their houses in
order, Israel will most likely face new difficulties.

TB: You have questioned U.S. support for Islamic democracy, which
does seem naive.
