Potential Customers

¢ Retail/Brands: We help businesses/retailers identify which customer is not
happy in seconds. We help them determine a customer’s intent and buying
habits. Also, we aid retailers and businesses with product development
ideas and go-to market strategies.

° Politics: Through the vast amount of data available across social media, we
can not only help politicians to understand what their constituents are
talking about but also to influence people, track voters and get them to
vote.

¢ Stocks: Investors who predict stock behavior by interpreting news and
public sentiment make better trades and informed decisions. InsightsPod
can give an insight into public sentiment quickly and can aid financial
institutions as well as individuals to make sound investment decisions.
