‘Blahblahs’ forbidden in Radical Breakthroughs’. So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science
and Rare Sentience).

Initial ideas:

* Expand the first episode “Mathematics and Truth” into two or likely three episodes. I’m intrigued by this
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner’s
‘unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)’, astrophysics, cosmology, biology,
general systems theory. I’ve felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think
three episodes could work - if you agree, I’ll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3
parts. Also, Closer To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277
episodes!), so this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the
series.

* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un
of Wisconsin-Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory.

* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my
expertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you

need to tell me if you would like to include this.

* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability
in biomedical and especially psychological research - the scandal in recent years. See links and attachments.

* Other possibile areas you suggest

We would like to set a mutually agreed schedule so we can confirm and reserve the Closer To Truth ‘season’
of 13 episodes for 'Radical Breakthroughs’, which we need to plan well in advance - especially as we begin
2018.

See you Jan. 5 - Looking forward to brainstorming.
