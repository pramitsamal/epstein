OBSERVATIONS — PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES

As originally proposed, the House and Senate took fundamentally different approaches to the taxation of pass-
through entities (sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, LLPs and S-corporations). While they differed from each
other, they shared the goal of creating preferential treatment for certain pass-through business income. The Act
largely took the Senate’s approach but adopted a few elements of the House’s approach. The Act approaches
small business relief by permitting a non-itemized deduction of 20% of qualified business income; the remaining
80% would then be subject to normal tax rates. Therefore, the top tax rate for business income would be 29.6%
(80% x 37% = 29.6%). The provision is riddled with a host of complex limitations. For taxpayers not in the top
income tax bracket, the value of the deduction will depend on the marginal bracket that would otherwise be
imposed on the income.

Owners of service businesses (e.g., law, accounting and consulting, etc., but not engineering or architectural
services) generally would be eligible for the 20% deduction unless taxable income exceeds $315,000 for married
filing jointly ($157,500 for others). The benefit of the 20% deduction is phased out and fully eliminated over the
