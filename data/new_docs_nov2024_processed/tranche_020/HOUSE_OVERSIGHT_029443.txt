TAX BULLETIN 2018-1: TAX REFORM SIGNED INTO LAW

next $100,000 of taxable income for married filing jointly ($50,000 for others). The following is a simple example

for a pass-through entity.

EXAMPLE

H and W file a joint return on which they report taxable income of $200,000 (determined without regard

to this provision). H has a sole proprietorship that is a qualified business and is a “specified service
business.” W is an employee and receives only W-2 wages from her job.

H’s qualified business income is $150,000. 20 percent of the qualified business income is $30,000.
Because H and W’s taxable income is below the $315,000 threshold amount for a joint return, (i) the wage

limit does not apply to H’s qualified business, and (ii) the limitation applicable to specified service

businesses does not apply. H’s deductible amount for qualified business income is $30,000.

On their joint return, H & W would qualify for a $30,000 deduction, reducing their taxable income from
$200,000 to $170,000. That taxable income would then be subject to regular income rates.

While upper-income wage earners in high-tax states generally do not fare well under the Act, taxpayers with

substantial income from pass-through businesses should see a tax benefit compared with current law, since the

weighted average rate of business income would be approximately 30%. Capital gains, dividends, and other

preferential income from a business would not be considered “business income” and would continue to be taxed

at preferential tax rates.

Under the initial Senate version, the pass-through deduction was not available to trusts or estates. Under the Act,
however, trusts and estates can benefit from the pass-through deduction.
