Mutual Aid

TCMIH will be available and prepared to fulfill its mutual aid commitment to the Virgin Islands
Emergency Medical Services (VIEMS) under the directives of the Virgin Islands Territorial
Management Agency (VITEMA). When called upon we will assist in the evacuation of healthcare
facilities, special needs residents and nursing facilities to safety, only to return them home again
after the storms have passed.

Community Paramedicine

Community paramedicine (CP) is an emerging healthcare profession. It allows paramedics, Nurses
and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to operate in expanded roles to provide healthcare
services to underserved populations. It is a way to improve rural emergency medical services
(EMS) as well as address the healthcare needs of the community.

Some rural patients lack access to primary care, and misuse 911 services in an attempt to access
emergency departments for routine healthcare. This is demanding on our EMS system and causes
strains on the workforce. Working in a primary care role, community paramedics can meet the
needs of such individuals, as well as others in the community, in a more efficient and proactive
way.
