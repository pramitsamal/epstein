access to, and almost no politically serious negotiations with, the
SCAF.

The clashes in Tahrir Square on April 9-10, which led to the deaths
of two protesters, were the most serious to date between activists and
the Army. The distance between the Army and young democratic
activists grew further on April 11, when a military court sentenced
the first blogger since the fall of Mubarak to prison for criticizing the
military.

In the SCAF’s March 30 “Constitutional Declaration,” it became
absolutely clear that, unlike Tunisia, the parliament to be elected in
September will not form a government. Articles 56 and 61 stipulate
that the SCAF will retain a broad range of executive powers until a
president is elected. Instead of Parliament acting as the sovereign
body that will write a constitution, Article 60 mandates that it is to
“elect a 100-member constituent assembly.” The big question now is
how many non-elected outside experts will end up in this “constituent
assembly” and how they will arrive there.

Of course, many still fear that Islamic fundamentalists will hijack
Egypt’s revolution. But I see that as an improbable outcome, given
the growing diversification of Muslim identities in the new context of
political freedoms, secular parties’ efforts to keep the Muslim
Brotherhood within electoral politics, and the profiles of the three
leading presidential candidates, none of whom want the Egyptian
Revolution to be captured.

In short, a successful democratic transition 1s possible in Tunisia, and
not impossible in Egypt. That fact, alone, should bolster the hopes of
Arab democratic activists elsewhere as well.
