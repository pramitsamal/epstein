priorities have all contributed to the failure of the reform process in
Jordan over the past decade. In view of the recent uprisings in the
Arab world, the political elite must recognize that the only way they
can retain power is by sharing it, and governments will have to
acknowledge that substituting serious implementation with reform
rhetoric fools no one. Given that Jordan enjoys a rather distinctive
position-its monarchy enjoys widespread legitimacy and plays a role
in stability that is acknowledged by all sectors of society, including
the opposition-the king is in a unique position to lead a serious
reform process. The choice in Jordan seems to be similar to that of
other countries around it: either lead a reform process from above in a
gradual, orderly, and serious way, or watch it take place in the streets
below with uncontrolled consequences.
