Lawyers for U.S.-based
Turkish cleric fear attacks
on his life

WASHINGTON | BY JULIA HARTE

Lawyers for U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen said on Friday
they feared attacks on his life following Turkey's demands that he be
extradited to face allegations that he ordered a failed coup against the
government last month.

The lawyers said they expected Gulen, who has denied any
involvement in the July 15 coup attempt, will remain in his remote
mountain compound in Pennsylvania.
