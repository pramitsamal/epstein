society-friends-close-ranks/ ---

I read:

The crowd at the events top publicist Peggy Siegal has organized for Epstein proves the point, at least behind closed doors. I and
many others that know him describe him as brilliant, says Siegal.

His unique mind is what attracts the world's smartest people to his home. Last September, with Siegal's help, Epstein hosted a Break
Fast after Yom Kippur. A group of 120 friends brought their children over for a buffet dinner

This was just a few months after he finished his prison obligations in Florida.
And here he is, entertaining --- with children present.

This Break Fast is one of a number of social events involving post-prison Jeffrey that attracted celebrated, powerful people.
Of course I have zero idea who said, NO WAY and didn't cross his doorway.

My questions are:

1) I You have known him for decades, were/are friends, etc.

Why was your reaction to his crimes to continue being his friend --- and not in a covert way?
2) What would he have had to do for you to shun him --- to cut him out of your life?

You're the ultimate professional; you may not want to respond.

Especially because I'm NOT reaching out to anyone else who's named in the piece.

I don't care about them.

But it ain't me to blindside you.
