exported concept of the nation-state.

Following World War II, as European colonialism waned, the US
assumed a more significant role in the Middle East. US foreign policy
was driven primarily by oil interests, the protection of Israel and
resistance to Soviet aggression. To prevent the region from dissolving
in sectarian conflict, the US established a series of autocracies. The
campaign included restoring the Shah of Iran to the throne after the

supporting for the Baathist overthrow of the Qasim government in
Iraq, which gave rise to Saddam Hussein.

Following the end of the Cold War, America’s foreign policy gravitated
toward nation building, and the widespread promotion of democracy
and human rights abroad. However, an iron fisted policies the
strongmen imposed to remain in power conflicted with the moral
endeavor to curate democracy afar. Hence, America’s crusade
undermined its original goals by threatening the same autocratic
regimes the US had helped establish.

As the leaders the West once championed are toppled one by one, the
boot-prints of Western Power are clearly visible. Regimes once
supported by the US have fallen, marking the failure of embrace and
abandon. In Egypt, Mubarak was in, then deserted. In Iraq, Hussein

of political Islam. The rise of Islamic factions battling for territory is a
