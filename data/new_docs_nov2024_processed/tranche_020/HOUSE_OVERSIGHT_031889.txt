There is another problem with realism. Like it or not, the United
States is a revolutionary power. Whether our government is trying to
overthrow foreign dictators is almost irrelevant; American society is
the most revolutionary force on the planet. The Internet is more
subversive than the CIA in its prime. The dynamism of American
society is constantly creating new businesses, new technologies, new
ideas and new social models. These innovations travel, and they
make trouble when they do. Saudi conservatives know that whatever
geopolitical arrangements the Saudi princes make with the American
government, the American people are busily undermining the core
principles of Saudi society. It’s not just our NGOs educating Saudi
women and civil society activists; it’s not just the impact of American
college life on the rising generation of the Saudi elite. We change the
world even when we aren’t thinking anything about global revolution —
when Hollywood and rap musicians are just trying to make a buck,
they are stoking the fires of change around the world.

A revolutionary nation cannot make a conservative foreign policy
work for long. In the 1820s and 1830s Washington tried to reassure
the Mexican government that it had no hostile designs against
Mexican territory. But the American people were moving into Texas
and the US government couldn’t stop that movement or blunt the
threat to Mexico if it tried. In the same way today, the economic and
political activity of individual Americans and American companies is
changing the world in ways that make life much harder for
governments in countries like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. We
can press all the reset buttons with Russia that we want, but the
Russian government will still notice that both US society and
sometimes the government are actively working to help foreign
subversives overthrow repressive regimes.
