Obama will have to make some decisions. But it’s far better to let the
Syrians do this themselves, if they can. We cannot prevent every
casualty. That’s starting to sound like a doctrine to me. Call it the
doctrine of no doctrine: using our power and influence but doing so
prudently and multilaterally, with the crucial recognition that Egypt is
different from Libya is different from Syria is different from
someplace else. According to the foreign-policy establishment, if you
want to have a self-respecting big-D doctrine, you’re not supposed to
recognize differences. The doctrine must guide all cases. But that is
exactly the kind of thinking that has led—always—to tragedy. The
Truman Doctrine was never meant to be applied to Vietnam. The
Bush Doctrine was applied to Iraq based on a series of lies told to the
American people. And so on. If the Obama Doctrine is nothing like
those, so much the better. This does not yet greatness make. These
dramatic changes have to work out for the better, and here the United
States has a huge role to play. With respect to Libya, for example, we
have control of about $37 billion in assets we can dole out to the
transitional council. And yes, we probably are interested in its oil.
But that doesn’t have to mean stealing it. All the Western countries
that backed the rebels have to play a constructive and non- (forgive
me for such a dated word) imperialist role in helping the country
build its future. So there’s work to be done. But it’s hardly
impossible to envision an Obama administration in a few years’ time
that has drawn down Afghanistan and Iraq, helped foster reforms and
maybe even the growth of a couple of democracies around the Middle
East, and restored the standing of a country that Bush had laid such
staggering waste. And killed Osama bin Laden. If this is weak
America-hating, count me in.
