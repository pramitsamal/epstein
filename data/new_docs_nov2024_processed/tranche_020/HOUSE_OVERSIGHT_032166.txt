needs corrrection.. Netanyahu is not a coward.
I've seen him as a young special forces

officer ,under my command, facing fire directly and
taking risks to his life. A very courageous soldier.
That will never change. cheap words serve little
purpose .The same applies to President Obama
and Secretary Kerry. they are not enemies of
Israel. they are Good Friends. Kerry has exhibited
decades long support for Israel. Since he became
secretary of State he has invested his time
energy and prestige trying to help Israel and the
Palestinians to bridge disputes and reach a
breakthrough. it was a noble effort which

should justify thanks rather than accustations. We
are of course concerned by the lack of outcome of
the P5+1 negotiations with Iran and we think that
the chemical weapons removal from Syria could
have been handled differently But President
Obama strengthens the legacy of Presidential
support for Israel.. Israel has a vital interest in
resuming the healthy trust, and mutual respect
that existed until recently.

. | believe that the most profound internal debate
inside Israel today is in regard to the relationship
