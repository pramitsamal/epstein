years. Three-quarters of the population rely on food aid.

Areas with as contested a history as this one can choose among

In assessing the condition of the 1.6 million people who live in Gaza,
there are issues of where to draw the baseline and — often — what
motivates the discussion. It has never been among the world’s
poorest places. There is near universal literacy and relatively low
infant mortality, and health conditions remain better than across
much of the developing world.

“We have 100 percent vaccination; no polio, measles, diphtheria or

still controls access to sea, air and most land routes, and its security
policies have consciously strangled development opportunities for an
