What nice coverage in the Huffington Post.

Living in Europe, | was not aware that Trump's proposed cuts will be so devastating to the scientific
community.

You asked me if | would be in New York September 18. Did you have something in mind?

lam 77 and do not travel so well. | have cut back on my plans to travel. | can consider coming to New York,
September has anything to do specifically with the vagus nerve - and if it cannot be done with a conference
call on Skype.

| will be able to stop in NYC on a future trip.
Linda Stone was the person who | met with years ago. It was Linda who suggested that | contact you.
best wishes,

Stanley
