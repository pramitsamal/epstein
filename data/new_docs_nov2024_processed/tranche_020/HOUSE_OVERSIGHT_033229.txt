Jeffrey

Pres. Trump arrives PBI Friday at 6pm is TFR is effective,. If we land before 6pm we are ok.
Newark is not a gateway airport to PBI, only Teterboro,,
If you want to arrive in PBI after 6pm,. I can relocate the GIV to Teterboro,

what time do you estimate wheels up Friday from Newark? Or should I move plane to Teterboro Friday
afternoon?

Thx
Larry
