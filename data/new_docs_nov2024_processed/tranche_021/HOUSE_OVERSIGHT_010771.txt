Page 15 of 20

Similarly, Dershowitz appeared on NBC’s Today Show the morning after Edwards and
Cassell made a filing for Ms. Giuffre, to say that the Edwards and Cassell — and Ms. Giuffre —
were all “lying” in the court documents:

Question from Savannah Guthrie: /n legal papers from the lawyers, they say you’ve
had, in fact, the opportunity to be deposed.

Answer from Alan Dershowitz: They’re lying. They’re lying.
Question: They show letters in which they offered to depose you.
Answer: And they didn’t show my letters in response saying, (a), if you ask me about
my legal relationship with Epstein and I’ll be happy to answer. . . . And I responded
that I would be happy to be deposed if you could give me any indication that I would
be a relevant witness .... They will be proved — all of them [i.e., Cassell, Edwards,
and Ms. Giuffre] — to be categorically lying and making up this story. And it will bea
terrible thing for rape victims. ... We [Epstein and Dershowitz] had an academic
relationship. I was never in the presence of a single, young, underaged
woman. When I was with him, it was with prominent scientists, prominent
academics. And they’re just — again — lying about this. I never saw him doing
anything improper. I was not a participant. I was not a witness.

As another example, in Miami Herald, Dershowitz called the Joinder Motion that he
seeks to have sealed “the sleaziest /egal document1 have ever seen. They [Edwards and
Cassell] manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested in money. This is a
disbarrable offense, and they will be disbarred. They will rue the day they ever made this false

charge against me” — i.e., Edwards and Cassell will “rue the day” they ever filed the Joinder

Motion. Miami Herald (Jan. 3, 2015).
