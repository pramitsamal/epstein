APPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation

Output and Cash Flow

My focus will be on absolute rather than per capita values. The usual custom gives
capital letters for the former and lower-case ones for the latter. I will prefer the
upper case for stocks and flows, and the lower one for rates. That need not hold true

for Greek letters.

The total return truism can be notated

Y=K,+F, (A1.1)

where Y is output, K,, is total capital and F is cash flow. Also

F=t+C, and t=T,-T_, (A1.2)

where T (tau) is net transfer, tT, is transfer out, t_ is transfer in and C, is pure

consumption (exhaust in taste satisfaction). Cash flow is the net of positive less

negative components. I define them by

F=t,+C, F=t and F=F -F. (A1.2a)

+

At the collective scale, where transfers cancel internally, these equations combine

for

Y=K,+C, and F=F=C,. (A1.3)

p

Math reminds us continually that “equals” does not necessarily mean “is”. (A1.1) and

(A1.3), for example, do not mean that output is growth plus cash flow or growth plus
