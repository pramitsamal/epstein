where 4 (lambda) is deadweight loss. Meanwhile negative output belongs in the
unrealized component of output Y. as with all effects on net capitalization not

explained by transfer in or plowback from revenue. It is the random negative

component in free growth. Then define positive and negative output and realized

output more fully by

Y,(>0)=max(¥,,0),  Y,(<0)=max(-Y,,0)=4, Y,=Y,(>0)-A, (A4.1)
and

Y(>0)=max(Y,0), Y(<0)=max(-Y,0)=A and Y=Y(>0)-/. (A4.2)

There is also indirect capitalization from inside in the form of plowback from
revenue. The growth truism sums these inflows less outflows as

K,=7_+Y,(>0)+p,-D=t_+Y¥,+p,—D,, (A4.3)

recalling that D, shows recovered (realized) decapitalization.

At the scale of the total capital of any individual or set of them, (A1.5) and (A4.3)

give
K,=y_+Y, +p,-C,. (A4.4)

Human Cash Flow

Although I can’t recall seeing the term “human cash flow” in any papers or textbooks
of others, tradition defines the flow discounted to human capital as pay less Schultz’
“pure investment”. The flow so discounted is implicitly cash flow. | rename pure

investment “invested consumption,” and write the traditional view as
