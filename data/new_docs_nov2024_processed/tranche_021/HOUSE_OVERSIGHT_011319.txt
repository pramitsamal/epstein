statements against my client.

The case that they cite actually, the Minemyer case,

goes against them. It actually talks about how you would have

to call the reporter, that that couldn't come into evidence.

And so, your Honor, for those reasons, we believe that, again,

hearsay document like that to come in without our ability to be

able to cross examine that individual. So for those reasons,
your Honor, we believe that that should not come in.

They also made an argument that it's somehow an
intervening cause or that, you know, it goes to the issue of

is responsible for their own defamation, so it doesn't come
