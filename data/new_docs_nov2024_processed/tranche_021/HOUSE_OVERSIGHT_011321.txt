defendant abused her.

These are also classic examples of evidence that

to prove that she engaged in any type of sexual behavior to

prove any type of disposition.

It should also b xcluded under Rule 403. This is

xtremely prejudicial, and because it is irrelevant, it would
only encourage the jury to view Ms. Giuffre, a married mother
in her 30s, as an immoral person for having sexual contact with
individuals as a child.
