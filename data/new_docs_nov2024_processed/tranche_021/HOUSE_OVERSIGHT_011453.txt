MR. PAGLIUCA: (continued) I don't care about that,
but, you know, I mean, we're going to deal with these issues,

and we'll deal with them so the timing is of no consequence to

me, but I'm not complaining about it, I'm just responding to

it.

But for those reasons, your Honor, you shouldn't allow

anybody to present any adverse inference from these witnesses.

They should not just be part of this trial. Thank you.

MR. CASSELL: In reply, your Honor, I think you can

just see from the upset there what's going to be happening at

this trial. This is the direct quote from Mr. Pagliuca.

Fantastical conspiracy. That's going to be the argument from

the other side. They're obviously entitled to advance that

argument. But that's what Ms. Giuffre is going to need to

respond to at the trial. And, of course, the jury will think

this is a fantastical conspiracy if Ms. Giuffre doesn't even

bring in some of the alleged conspirators such as Epstein,
Kellen, and Marcinkova.
Now, we'll hear that this is somehow a hearsay issue

under 801(d) (2). This is not a hearsay. There are going to be

witnesses in the case, questioned and cross examined. So this
isn't a question of inadmissible hearsay, this is a question of
presenting a witness to the jury.

THE COURT: How do you think this evidence is it's

going to go in by way of either deposition or the depositions
