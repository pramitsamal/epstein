4.5 Globalist versus Localist Representations 91

The basic logic of action in Psi is carried out by “triples” that are very similar to CogPrime’s
Context \ Procedure > Goal triples. However, an important role is played by four modulators
that control how the processes of perception, cognition and action selection are regulated at a
given time:

e activation, which determines the degree to which the agent is focused on rapid, intensive
activity versus reflective, cognitive activity

e resolution level, which determines how accurately the system tries to perceive the world

e certainty, which determines how hard the system tries to achieve definite, certain knowledge

e selection threshold, which determines how willing the system is to change its choice of which
goals to focus on

These modulators characterize the system’s emotional and cognitive state at a very abstract
level; they are not emotions per se, but they have a large effect on the agent’s emotions. Their
intended interaction is depicted in Figure 4.15.

4.5.11 The Emergence of Emotion in the Psi Model

We now briefly review the specifics of how Psi models the emergence of emotion. The basic idea is
to define a small set of proto-emotional dimensions in terms of basic Urges and modulators.
Then, emotions are identified with regions in the space spanned by these dimensions.

The simplest approach uses a six-dimensional continuous space:
