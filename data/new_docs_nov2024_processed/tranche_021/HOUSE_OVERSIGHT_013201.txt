A rigorous mathematical analysis of the formation of hierarchical, heterarchical and dual
networks in CogPrime systems has not yet been undertaken, and would certainly be an inter-
esting enterprise. Similar to the theory of small world networks, there is ample ground here
for both theorem-proving and heuristic experimentation. However, the qualitative points made
here are sufficiently well-grounded in intuition and experience to be of some use guiding our
