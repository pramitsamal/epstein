UK —- Waiting for Brexit

It’s useful to think about where the UK is today in terms of the four risk factors we
identified in our February 2016 Brexit preview: 1) weaker GBP; 2} weaker UK growth; 3)
Higher UK risk premia & gilt yields; 4) increased regulatory, political and market
uncertainty.

Although we saw a severe risk-off move immediately following the Brexit vote, the only
truly significant post-Brexit delta has been a weaker GBP. GBP is down 16% vs USD and
11% on a trade weighted basis. In fact, a simple post-Brexit strategy of going equal
weighted long UK-listed sectors with above market international sales exposure vs
sectors with below market sales exposure would have delivered ~110% returns in USD.

The currency move contrasts with the other risk factors. To date, UK growth which has
held up better than many expected; policy uncertainty has fallen following a sharp spike;
gilts are only 2bp higher than June 23” (although this masks a 85bp rally then 87bp sell-
off); and the UK cost of equity is now down ytd. What Brexit, you could ask.
