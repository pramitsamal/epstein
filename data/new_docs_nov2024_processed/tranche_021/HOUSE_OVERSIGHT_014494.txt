The Utilities sector has suffered badly from the back up in bond yields. However,
fundamentals for the sector are actually improving relative to recent history. The sector
is the biggest direct beneficiary of corporate QE in the UK and Euro are (more than half
of the sector are eligible for the ECB’s Corporate Sector Purchase Program) meaning it
can gain more than most other sectors from potential refinancing savings. This cushions
any effect on debt costs from higher bond yields as corporate bond yields are still very

low.

Earnings and cash flow are improving. The bottoming out of the commodity cycle has
supported a turn to the upside for power prices. This has helped earning to trough and

analyst revisions have been positive throughout the last few months of

underperformance. Balance sheets and dividends in most cases now also look
sustainable. Valuation multiples for the Utilities sector are attractive relative to history
and compared to other Defensives. EV/EBITDA for the sector sits at 7.3x on Bloomberg
estimates. That is a 20% discount to the market and is near 10-year lows on a relative
basis. With dividends more secure the relative DY becomes more attractive at 2-year

highs.
