As a New Yorker from humble beginnings, Jeffrey Epstein played on his blue-collar credentials and
enormous wealth to extend tentacles of influence throughout America’s liberal political elite.

During the outcry over the Epstein case, it emerged that another man with a notorious appetite for
young women, Bill Clinton, travelled with Epstein to a number of destinations, including three times
on the billionaire’s private aircraft.

On one occasion, Epstein flew the former President, Hollywood actor and staunch Democrat Kevin
Spacey and another actor friend of Mr Clinton’s, Chris Tucker, to Africa, to ‘discuss AIDS policy’.

Epstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over the years to candidates from the Democratic
Party, also flew with Mr Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including Russia, Oslo, Hong
Kong, Shanghai and Beijing.

Yet Virginia Roberts stresses that she was never ‘lent out’ to Mr Clinton.

On one occasion, she adds, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his
Caribbean island for Mr Clinton shortly after he left office. But, as far as she knows, the ex-President
did not take the bait.

‘I'd have been about 17 at the time,’ she says. ‘I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then
Ghislaine Maxweil went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her.

out’
