In other words, 2Q17 marks the low point in oil and gas production, with
momentum accelerating in 2H17 to kick start a multi-year period of growth.

Critically, Hess has multiple levers to pull that reverse production declines as cash
becomes available from completion of NMB and Stampede.

Planned spending to complete NMB and Stampede is ~$700mm in 2017; with
completion we expect this to drop closer to $200mm in 2018 so that before any
contribution from operating cash flow from these projects we expect Hess ‘apples to
apples’ capex to move lower in 2018 driving an inflection in free cash flow.

Our assumptions include a likely project sanction of the first phase ‘early production
system’ at the Liza discovery in 2Q17. However, based on discovered oil to date that we
believe now easily exceeds 2bn barrels, we believe Hess is on the cusp of a multi-year
period of growth that is material for a company of its size. Critically, we believe most
commentators have not yet included the cash flow contribution from Guyana in Hess’
estimates given visibility that barely looks past 2018. However, with first oil now likely
