absolutely still while the world passes them by—tran, Iraq, Nicaragua, El
Salvador—and they get paid for it, just like the Mime. The Democrats are
like the Pacer, walking around in circles while the world passes them
by—lIsrael, Libya, Cuba, Honduras—and they don’ tget paid for it, just like
the Pacer.

But recently the Pacer did something that hurled such a comparison
right into the metaphor graveyard, along with “That' s like bringing coals
to Newcastle” (for Newcastle finally ad run out of coal) and “Good as
gold” (since the government now prints money without the benefit of the
gold standard). The Pacer had put a cardboard box down on the ground
and started walking around it. And now people began giving him money.

By the mere presence of that cardboard box, the Pacer had
transformed his personal perversion into a marketable talent. Just like so
many of us. And | could no longer feel superior to him. He was not just
some nut walking in circles. Now he was earning a living.

| still “do” the Pacer in my act, but with increased respect. “His
job is no less dignified than anything we do,” | tell the audience. “He
works hard all day, and then, just like you and me, he goes home and
unwinds.” And | proceed to walk around and around in a circle onstage,

only now in a clockwise direction.
