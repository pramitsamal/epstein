comedians do have something in common. We both like to have a good
opening line. As a performer, | always try to slant my opening line toward a
particular audience.

My opening line at the World Hemp Expo was, “Last night, for the
first time in my life, | used a hemp condom.” My opening line at a
Skeptics Conference, attended by the Amazing Randi and the Amazing
Kreskin, was: “The is the first conference |’ ve been to where there were
two people with the same first name of Amazing—but the Amazing Randi
was born with that name, it’ s on his birth certificate, whereas the
Amazing Kreskin changed his name for showbiz--his real name is the
Obnoxious Kreskin.”. And my opening line at a luncheon during the Los
Angeles County Bar Association conference was, “I’ d like to begin with a
moment of silence, so that you can think about your client’ s problem,
and then you can make this a billable hour.”

Now | find myself in a lavish hotel suite, trying to crystallize an
opening line while contemplating the bald spot on the back of my head,
infinitely cloned in the mirrors of the hotel-room bathroom, actually the
only place | ever get to see that bald spot as others do. This will be a
serious opening line, since | have been told that, in the introduction to my

performance, | will be presented with the Lifestyles Freedom Award. |
