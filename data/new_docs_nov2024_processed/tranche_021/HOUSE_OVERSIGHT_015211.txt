In 1995, Connection filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of

whatsoever,” Patti Thomas tells me. “As far as | know, once we do
present our case to the Court of Appeals, if our decision isn’ t favorable,

alternative lifestyles. Obviously, the average person involved in swinging
would have no way of combating this law on their own.”
