that, as the millennium comes to an end, tantric men will be popping up
everywhere.

A retired chairman and CEO of a title and escrow company, who
attended another tantra party, tells me, “The difference between the
tantra party and the party next door is the fact that at the beginning of the
wedding tantra party there was a lot of ceremony and shared tantra ritual,
but once we had experienced that, it was every person for themselves. It
was like the party next door.” These were closed parties by invitation only.
But you didn’ t need an invitation for open parties. All you had to do was
find them.

The Wyndham Hotel is permeated by a sense of uninhibitedness. In
the elevator, a beautiful black woman is looking in the full-length mirror
and admiring her new Clit Clip—non-piercing, adjustable, genital jewelry--

“not designed to be painful,” | learned at the Adult Marketplace, “just
very sensual and aesthetically attractive. The Clit Clip is a long narrow, U-
shaped piece of metal, designed to fit around the clitoris hood, with some
light-catching Austrian crystals, in your choice of clear, red, blue and
purple, dangling from the ends.” The woman in the elevator turns toward

me and says, “Isn’ tit nice?” Her husband smiles proudly.
