ring was actually sanctioned, and they could target children like myself
who were so horribly abused that they would be used in child
pornography. When my father was caught sending this pornography
through the mail, Gerald Ford approached and told him that he could
receive immunity from prosecution if he would sell me into the project. My
father eagerly agreed. He was so happy that the government actually
condoned child abuse that he went on to have five more children to raise
for the project, so there were seven of us in all. He was never prosecuted
and remains free for reasons of national security.”

At the age of 13, she met the man “who would become my
owner” —Senator Robert Byrd. In 7rance Formation, she describes their
first meeting:

“| undressed and climbed into his bed as ordered. | was
momentarily relieved to find that his penis was abnormally tiny—so small
it didn’ t even hurt! And | could breathe with it in my mouth! Then he
began to indulge himself in his brutal perversions, talking on and on about
how | was ‘made just for him’ due to the vast amounts of pain | could
withstand. The spankings and police handcuffs | had previously endured
were child’ s play compared to Senator Byrd’ s near-death tortures. The

hundreds of scars on my body still show today.
