1986 it was the turn of the Presidio. The San Francisco Police investigated,
verified that my wife and | had been three thousand miles away in
Washington, D.C.—where | was on duty every single day [that the alleged
victim] was at the day-care center September 1st to October 31st,
1986—and closed the case with no charges accordingly.
“In October 1988, however, | appeared as a panelist on a Gera/do
Rivera Halloween Special. Rivera was trying to aggravate and escalate the
‘Satanic Ritual Abuse’ witch-hunt mania, and | was speaking out against
it. The broadcast came to the attention of Senator Jesse Helms who
became enraged that a Lt. Colonel in the Army should dare to hold a
‘Satanic’ religion. As Freedom of information filings later revealed,
Helms then secretly contacted his close personal friend, Secretary of the
Army John Marsh, and insisted that Marsh devise some way to destroy my
career.
“What was actually taking place: a blatant attempt by Senator
Helms, Secretary of the Army Marsh and the Criminal Investigation
Division of the Army to discredit an Army officer with a ‘politically

incorrect’ religion. It didn’ t work.”
