Ok, well let’s back up before we get to those conversations and tell me approximately
when it was that you were contacted by the person who you believe was with the FBI.

Ok. It’s hard for me to pinpoint, if I had to pinpoint it, it would be in 2007 sometime.
Alright. And you were living in Australia at that time, correct?

Correct.

You were contacted by telephone?

That’s correct, by my cell phone.

Ok and do you have any idea how your name came up leading to that contact.

No idea. No idea whatsoever. When I did ask, I was told that some girls had revealed
my name, I guess, and that’s how everybody, the FBI knew to contact me.

OK.

But I don’t know offhand or sorry, I just walked into the wrong room.
Ok.

Sorry go on.

Yes & J°ll never tell her you said that. Virginia, how long was it after that phone call
from the FBI person were you contacted by Mr. Epstein’s lawyers.

Like a week. It was back to back to each other. I remember being so scared after talking |
to the FBI thinking what’s happening, what’s going on. It’s been like 6 years, 7 years at
that stage, how did they find me & what do I have to do with this? So yeah, I do
remember that very well, and it was only about a week later I was called by his attorney.

Who was it that contacted you, do you remember?

I want to say Bill Riley, but he might have been from the FBI. No, it was Bill Riley. Bill
Riley. Not sure if that’s his correct name, but that’s what is coming to mind

What do you remember about that conversation?
I remember a Mr. Goldberger as well, I remember, there might have been two of them.

Alright.
