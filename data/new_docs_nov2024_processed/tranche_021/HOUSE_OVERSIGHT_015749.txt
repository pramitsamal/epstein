Bad Understanding
Can Kill

() n January 16, 2003, at 3:39pm, the Columbia space shuttle took

off from Cape Canaveral. During the launch a small piece of

foam insulation broke off the fuel tank and hit the shuttlecraft.
The event was recorded on a few low-resolution video frames. They
show a tiny white object hitting the shuttle and a plume of dusty material
splattering outward. The shuttle made it safely into orbit and for two
weeks engineers on the ground debated what to do. In the end, it was
decided the risk was minimal and the shuttle could safely return to Earth.
On reentry, the shuttle disintegrated, killing seven astronauts.

NASA managers had decided the shuttle was undamaged based
on a series of presentations by the engineers. One image in particular
analyzed the potential
damage to the shuttle’s
tiles from an impact.
Read the slide, look
at the key frames, and
decide for yourself what
action you would have : —
taken.
