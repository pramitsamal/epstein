represents the design for a building or a mathematical theorem, these
numbers have purpose. If I input these numbers to a computer along
with some building design software or a copy of Mathematica they
will do something interesting; allowing a construction firm to build a
innovative building or a mathematician to check a theorem is sound.

It’s a lot harder to prove numbers representing art are functionally
useful. A work of art is in some sense not complete — it still needs to go
through the process of being appreciated by someone. We could show it
to a friend or exhibit it in a gallery but this is un unpredictable process.
