are the real problem. If we are lucky, they may treat us as amusing pets.
If we are unlucky...

These consequences might have come to pass if the answer to the
Halting Problem were ‘yes’ but as the answer is ‘no! This is not the future

Mummy, where do Bugs Come From?
One consequence of the logic limit provides a theoretical basis for the
origin of computer bugs. The mention of ‘bug’ conjures up stories of
dead creepy crawlies stuck in early computer circuits, but the term had
been in use for over 150 years before the computer was even invented.
Bugs are not simply annoying mistakes.If you misspell my name as Stagg
instead of Tagg that’s just carelessness. Real flaws creep into a computer
program when you fail to understand Brooks’ essential complexity, or by
my terminology, you stray above the logic limit without realizing it.
Imagine we have created a piece of software. The software goes
into test and is subjected to a range of use cases. Some of these will fail
because we did not take into account all the real world possibilities.
Then a strange thing happens. We get trapped in a loop of patching the
errors in the program in a rather mechanical way. Find an error, patch
