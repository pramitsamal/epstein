mismatch between focal depth and the apparent distance implied by
motion parallax is one of the reasons you can get headaches watching
3D images. There is something not quite right about them and your eye
has to learn a new behavior.

Our poor friend at the end of the phone is listening to a mere 4700 bits
per second rendition of the comedian. A compact disk is 64,000, 16-

information content of a mobile phone call is very low. It is a miracle
you can understand speech at all over such a narrow channel, but this is
made possible by two factors. First, human speech uses a limited range
of frequencies. All the information in our voices lies within about two
octaves centered on middle C. And, second, you can perform some
