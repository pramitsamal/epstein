dynamite. This was used in the mining industry but also extensively in
weaponry, so he came to be known as the Merchant of Death during his
lifetime.

To be known as the merchant of death would have a profound effect
on anyone. As Nobel pondered the balance of his life’s work he decided
to do something positive with the huge wealth he had accumulated. On
his death in 1896, he willed his entire fortune to create the awards we
now call Nobel Prizes.

There were five original prizes; physics, chemistry, peace, physiology
or medicine, and literature. A newer economic science prize is awarded
by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

You must be alive to receive a Nobel Prize; a few have been
awarded posthumously because the laureate died after the winner was
announced but before the award ceremony. The work must have been
proven experimentally, and although originally it was supposed to be for
discoveries in the previous year, nowadays a theory must have stood the
test of time. Consequently, winners tend to be quite old. The prize must be
for something with practical applicability — Einstein received his Nobel
Prize for the Photo Electric Effect, rather than his more famous Theory
of Relativity. The judges evidently thought particles more practical than
planets! The prize is usually awarded to a maximum of three people. This
has produced some controversial results but despite this the Nobel Prize
is the uncontested top prize in science.
