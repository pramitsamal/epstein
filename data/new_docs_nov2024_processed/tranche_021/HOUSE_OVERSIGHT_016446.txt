He has never been in the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans, largely
because the magazine has never been able to determine the source or the size of
his wealth.

He has been dogged by questions about his financial dealings. A former business
partner, Steven Hoffenberg, sued him in 2016, claiming that Epstein was the
mastermind behind a $500 million Ponzi scheme that Hoffenberg was
imprisoned for in 1995. Hoffenberg served 18 years for the scam, but he later
dropped the lawsuit against Epstein.

In August, two of Hoffenberg’s former investors rekindled the lawsuit against
Epstein, but the case was dropped in October.

Epstein and his associate, British-born socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, were also
accused in a 2015 federal civil suit of organizing underage sex parties on his
private plane, nicknamed “The Lolita Express,” and at Epstein’s various homes.
Maxwell, who has never been charged with wrongdoing, has denied allegations
made in the lawsuit that she was Epstein’s “madam.” The suit, filed by victim
Virginia Roberts, was settled in 2017.
