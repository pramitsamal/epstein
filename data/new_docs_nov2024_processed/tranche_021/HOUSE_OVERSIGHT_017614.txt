were expansive and could apply before charges were filed but were subject to the outer limit that the Government has at least
contemplated charges. 7!

Similarly, in United States v. Oakum, ” the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia considered a claim that CVRA
rights did not apply until after a defendant had been convicted. In rejecting that argument, the court agreed with the Dean court
that victims acquire rights even before a prosecution begins.

The District Court for the Northern District of Indiana held to the same effect in In re Petersen. 7* There, the court held that a
victim's right to be treated with fairness and with respect for [his or her] dignity and privacy may apply before any prosecution

is underway and isn't necessarily tied to a court proceeding' or case. 7° The court, however, found that the conclusory

allegations in the victims' petition did not create a plausible claim for relief under the CVRA. 7°

[*75] Perhaps the most extensive discussion of this issue has come from the Epstein case discussed earlier. 7’ Overruling the

Government's argument that the CVRA only applies after the formal filing of charges, Does v. United States held that the
statutory language clearly contemplates pre-charge proceedings. 78 The court in Does explained that court proceedings
involving the crime are not limited to post-complaint or post-indictment proceedings, but can also include initial appearances
and bond hearings, both of which can take place before a formal charge. 7? The court also noted that the CVRA's
requirement that officials engaged in detection [or] investigation’ [of crimes] afford victims the rights enumerated in
subsection (a) surely contemplates pre-charge application of the CVRA. ®° Finally, the court in Does noted that if the
CVRA's rights may be enforced before a prosecution is underway, then, to avoid a strained reading of the statute, those rights
must attach before a complaint or indictment formally charges the defendant with the crime. °!

In sum, the relevant case law unanimously agrees that the CVRA extends rights to crime victims before charges have been
filed.

76 Id. Petersen also held that one specific CVRA right - the right to confer - only applies after charges have been filed. Id. But the authorities
Petersen cites for that proposition prove no such thing. Confusingly, Petersen cited the Fifth Circuit's ruling in Dean for support; but (as just
explained above) Dean held exactly the opposite. Similarly, Petersen cites other cases involving the right to confer after charges have been
filed. Id. But none of these cases actually presented the issue of the CVRA's application to pre-indictment situations, since charges had
already been filed in each of these cases. See, e.g., Jn re Stewart, 552 F.3d 1285, 1289 (11th Cir. 2008).

81 Td. Recently, the district court in the Does case also rejected Government efforts to dismiss the action. The district court found that, if the
victims could prove the factual allegations they have made, then they would be entitled to relief, including potentially the relief of
invalidating the nonprosecution agreement that Epstein obtained from the Government. Does v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM,
