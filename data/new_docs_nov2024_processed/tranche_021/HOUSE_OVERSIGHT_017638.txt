A. The Crime Victims’ Rights Movement

The Crime Victims' Rights Movement developed in the 1970s because of a perceived imbalance in the criminal justice system.

The victims' absence from criminal processes conflicted with a public sense of justice keen enough that ... it has found voice
in a nationwide victims' rights' movement. © Victims advocates argued that the criminal justice system had become
preoccupied with defendants’ rights to the exclusion of considering the legitimate interests of crime victims. ’ These advocates
urged reforms to give more attention to victims' concerns, including protecting victims’ rights to be notified of court hearings,
to attend those hearings, and to be heard at appropriate points in the process.

The victims movement received considerable impetus in 1982 with the publication of the report of the President's Task Force
on Victims of Crime (Task Force). The Task Force concluded that the criminal justice system has lost an essential balance...
. The system has deprived the innocent, the honest, and the helpless of its protection... . The victims of crime have been
transformed into a group oppressively burdened by a system designed to protect them. This oppression must be reddressed. 8
The Task Force advocated multiple reforms. It recommended that prosecutors assume the responsibility for keeping victims
notified of all court proceedings and bringing to the court's attention the victim's view on such subjects as bail, plea bargains,
sentences, and restitution. ° It also urged that courts receive victim-impact evidence at sentencing, order restitution in most
cases, and allow victims and their families to attend trials even if they would [*866] be called as witnesses. !° In its most
sweeping recommendation, the Task Force proposed a federal constitutional amendment to protect crime victims’ rights to be
present and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial proceedings. |!

In the wake of the recommendation for a constitutional amendment, crime victims' advocates considered how best to pursue
that goal. Realizing the difficulty of achieving the consensus required to amend the United States Constitution, advocates
decided to go first to the states to enact state victims’ rights amendments. They have had considerable success with this states-
first strategy. !? To date, about thirty states have adopted amendments to their own state constitutions, | which protect a
wide range of victims’ rights.
