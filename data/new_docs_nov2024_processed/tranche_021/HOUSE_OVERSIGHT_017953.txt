Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 19 of 28

70. In May 2015 Dershowitz requested confidential settlement negotiations with Ms.
Roberts’ lawyers in which Dershowitz sought to convince Ms. Roberts lawyer that Ms. Roberts
was mistaken, and that the person to whom Epstein had lent Ms. Roberts was Nathan Myhrvold,
not Dershowitz. Dershowitz claimed that he had been at Epstein’s home only once (and that he
was there with his family); that he had never been in the vicinity of Epstein’s island; that he had
not been at Epstein’s New York mansion; and that he had been at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch
only once for a few hours (again with his family). Dershowitz provided a summary of his
whereabouts that purported to prove that his assertions were true.

Zl, Dershowitz was told that, based on what was shown in his summary, it would
have been impossible for Ms. Roberts’ assertions about him to be true, and that if his assertions
proved out, Ms. Roberts counsel would undertake to convince her that she must have made a
mistake.

(a) Dershowitz was also told, however, (i) that his assertions would have to be
proven, (ii) that Ms. Roberts had always been very clear that she recalled having
had sex with Dershowitz multiple times, and (111) that everyone was convinced
that Ms. Roberts was telling the truth as she recalled it.

(b) Dershowitz responded that he did not doubt that Ms. Roberts was telling
the truth as she recalled it and that she would have no difficulty passing a lie
detector test. He said he simply believed Ms. Roberts had made an honest mistake
in confusing him with Nathan Myhrvold.

72. Following Dershowitz’ presentations, Dershowitz’s representations were

investigated and repeatedly proven false.
