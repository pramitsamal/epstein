The two spectacles combined are planting the seeds for new events in
the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict. Obama would not have uttered the
magic words 1967 borders if he had not wanted to woo the new
Arab revolutionaries and taken some credit for steering their
revolution towards the establishment of democracy, the spread of
freedom and the advancement of American interests in the region.
The approach is perfectly in keeping with Obama's sophisticated
style, which contrasts so starkly with his predecessor's crass
behaviour.

It is also an approach that is not far from the target. Obama's own
appearance on the scene has been a special sort of revolution, and a
rich and inspiring one at that. His address in Cairo delivered a
revolutionary message, equating what America stands for with
humanitarian traits. Certainly, no one will dispute the fact that
Obama had previously displayed no great fondness for Arab leaders,
unlike the Bush family with its various friendships and financial
connections with a good number of them. However, it has
nevertheless not taken long for Obama's courtship of the Arab
revolutionaries to run up against the Israeli wall, one that invariably
looms up to create a gulf between the US and the Arab world.

At the same time, it is important to bear in mind that in the modern
history of the Middle East, revolution and Arab awakening have long
been linked with the Palestinian cause. The recent reconciliation
between Fatah and Hamas, for example, probably reflected a general
desire to take advantage of a propitious historical moment, which
then found its reaffirmation in a global willingness to recognise a
Palestinian state within the 1967 borders and a US readiness to
pronounce the magic words in spite of Israel's anger.

However, the problem may be more complicated still, since the Arab
revolutionary movements of the second half of the 20th century,
which often built their revolutionary credentials and impetus on their
