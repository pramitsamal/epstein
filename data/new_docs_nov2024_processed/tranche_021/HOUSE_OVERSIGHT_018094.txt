Zawahiri at the Helm

Lawrence Wright

June 16, 2011 -- Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon, has
come into his inheritance—A1] Qaeda—at a time when the
organization is at its nadir. Osama bin Laden, its charismatic founder,
is dead, and after some internal debate his No. 2 man, Zawahiri, has
taken control. For nearly a decade, bin Laden pushed his followers to
come up with a second act to 9/11, but they were unable to match the
appalling brilliance of that attack. Now it is up to Zawahiri to salvage
an organization that many think (and hope) has drifted into
irrelevance. Compared to bin Laden, Zawahiri lacks charisma, but it
would be a mistake to underestimate his commitment and his
willingness to spill blood. He was hardened by the torture he endured
in the three years he spent in Egyptian prisons following the
assassination of Anwar al-Sadat, in 1981, and by the savage
underground war that he has fought with Egyptian intelligence
agencies ever since. Zawahiri has shown a daring willingness to
improvise. He inaugurated the use of suicide bombers with his failed
attack on the Egyptian Interior Minister, Hasan al-Alfi, in 1993,
although the tactic breaks a fundamental taboo in Islam against the
taking of one’s own life. He also introduced the propaganda ploy of
the martyrdom video, which would become a signature of Al Qaeda.
Bin Laden needed Zawahiri, not least because of his physical
ailments. Although bin Laden did not have kidney disease, as was
widely thought, he was often ill; Zawahiri served as his personal
physician, and manipulated his position to cement their relationship.
Bin Laden also depended on Zawahiri for his organizational skill and
the talented men he brought with him. But Zawahiri also depended
