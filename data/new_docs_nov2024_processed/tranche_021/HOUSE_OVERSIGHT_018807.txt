adhere to the Integra Realty Resources internal standards for an Appraisal Report —
Standard Format. This format summarizes the information analyzed, the appraisal methods
employed, and the reasoning that supports the analyses, opinions, and conclusions.

The subject is an existing 250-slip marina with 5 commercial buildings containing a mixture
of retail and office space types. The buildings contain 48,661 square feet of rentable area
and were constructed in multiple stages; with the majority of the construction completed in
1993. The commercial space is 85% leased as of the effective appraisal date. The marina
docks were constructed in multiple phases between 1991-1995 and are 52.8% occupied as
of the effective appraisal date. The total site area is 2.76 acres or 120,226 square feet, which
includes 0.64 acre or 27,878 square feet, that is re-claimed land. The property also includes
3.2 acres of seabed under the marina dock structures which is leased to the property owner
from the Government of the Virgin Islands.

Based on the valuation analysis in the accompanying report, and subject to the definitions,
assumptions, and limiting conditions expressed in the report, our opinion of value is as
follows:

Value Conclusion*

Market Value Leased Fee (Going Concern) November 25, 2015 $24,360,000

Allocation of Going Concern Value

Amount % of Total

Tangible Property
Land & Improvements $24,250,000 99.5%
Tangible Personal Property (FF&E) $110,000 0.5%
Total Tangible Property $24,360,000 100.0%
Intangible Assets so 0.0%
Market Value* $24,360,000 100.0%

*Specifically excluded from the valuation are cash and equivalents and current liabilities.

The allocation of value components is based on the going-concern premise, which holds that
the value of a business as a going-concern is equal to the sum of the values of the tangible
and intangible assets. The allocation assumes continued operation of the marina business.
Were the marina business to cease operations, the values of the individual components
would likely be different from the allocated values of the going concern.
