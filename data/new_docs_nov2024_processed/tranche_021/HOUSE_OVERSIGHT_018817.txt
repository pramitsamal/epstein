Research and Analysis

The type and extent of our research and analysis is detailed in individual sections of the report. This
includes the steps we took to verify comparable sales, which are disclosed in the comparable sale
profile sheets in the addenda to the report. Although we make an effort to confirm the arms-length
nature of each sale with a party to the transaction, it is sometimes necessary to rely on secondary
verification from sources deemed reliable.
