BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

outcome of elections. They need to hold votes to vali-
date their rule, but they also recognize the risk involved,
as elections remain a potent instrument of democratic
renewal even in deeply troubled societies.

The events of late 2014 and 2015 include vivid re-
minders of the power of the ballot. In Nigeria, Africa's
most populous country and largest economy, voters
who were fed up with governmental complacency,
terrorism, and graft rejected the incumbent presicent,
Goodluck Jonathan, and elected Muhammadu Buhari
to replace him. In Myanmar, a huge turnout produced
an overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections for
longtime opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her
National League for Democracy (NLD), a remarkable
turnaround in a country that until recently ranked
among the world’s most repressive.

Voters in Sri Lanka ousted their increasingly author-
itarian and divisive president, Mahinda Rajapaksa,

in favor of Maithripala Sirisena. Upon taking office,
Sirisena immediately overturned some of Rajapaksa’s
repressive policies and began repairing relations with
both the country’s Tamil minority and the international
community. And in Argentina, opposition candidate
Mauricio Macri won the presidency by defeating the
nominee of incumbent Cristina Fernandez de Kirch-
ner, who with her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, had
dominated the executive branch for over a decade.
Combined with a victory for the democratic opposi-
tion in Venezuela's parliamentary elections, Macri’s
victory may have been the beginning of a rollback of

Latin America’s populist movements, which had previ-
ously made impressive gains across the region.

Voters in these countries retained faith in the democrat-
ic process even after experiencing hardship after hard-
ship, including military rule (Myanmapn), civil war and au-
thoritarian rule (Sri Lanka), a terrorist scourge (Nigeria),
economic collapse and political repression (Venezuela),
and economic setback and unaccountable government
(Argentina). They prevailed despite, in some cases, an
electoral playing field tilted sharply against the opposi-
tion; in other cases, a history of political violence; and in
still other cases, apprehensions about what lies ahead
when dictatorships give way to normal politics.

Some of these voters were also rejecting political
figures who had publicly disdained the world’s democ-
racies and drawn closer to authoritarian powers like
Russia, China, and Iran. They were willing to listen to
candidates who talked about the rule of law, freedom
of expression, and the right to be free of payoffs and
bribes, and they were unimpressed by those who
blamed every step backward on foreign plots.

There will always be dictators and would-be leaders
for life who grow overconfident, lose touch with the
mood of their people, and fail to do what it takes to
ensure victory at the polls, as apparently occurred in
The Gambia in late 2016. But the rest can be expected
to learn from such mistakes and invest the necessary

resources in a false mockery of democratic suffrage.
