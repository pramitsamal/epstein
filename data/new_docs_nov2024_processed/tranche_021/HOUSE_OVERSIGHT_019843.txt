A NOTE ON THE TYPE

The text of this book was set in a typeface called Aldus, designed by
the celebrated typographer Hermann Zapf in 1952-53. Based on
the classical proportion of the popular Palatino type family, Aldus
was originally adapted for Linotype composition as a slightly
lighter version that would read better in smaller sizes.
Hermann Zapf was born in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1918. He
has created many other well known typefaces including Comenius,
© Hunt Roman, Marconi, Melior, Michelangelo, Optima, Saphir, Sis- ®
tina, Zapf Book and Zapf Chancery.
