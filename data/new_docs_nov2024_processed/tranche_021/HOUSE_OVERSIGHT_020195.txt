SNOWDEN’S ARC

“T woke this morning with a new name. I had had a vision. A dream vision. A vision righteous and true. Before

always been there, your avatar's true name. It slips through your subconscious, reveals itself under your posts, and
flashed visibly in that moment of unrestrained spite; in the indulgent teabag. You've felt it, known it, and
recognized it. Now realize it.

I woke this morning with a new name. That name is ... Wolfking Awesomefox”

--Edward Snowden in Geneva, June 12, 2008.
