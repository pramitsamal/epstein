“T had written several books ...”_-- My first book, Jnquest: The Warren Commission and
the Establishment of Truth, (Viking Press, New York 1966) examined the failure of the
FBI, Secret Service and CIA to establish the context of the John F. Kennedy
Assassination. This interest continued on other of my books, including Deception: The
Invisible War Between the KGB and the CIA (Simon and Schuster, New York, 1989), in
which I investigated the vulnerability of intelligence services involved in espionage during
the Cold War; Agency of Fear (G.P. Putnam’s Sons, New York, 1977), in which I
explored intelligence failures of domestic intelligence in the war on drugs; and James
Jesus Angleton: Was He Right (Fast Track Press/EJE Publications, New York 2011).

“extraditing Trent Martin ...”—The FBI press statement on this case was released March
27, 2013, less than two months before Snowden bought his ticket for Hong Kong.
