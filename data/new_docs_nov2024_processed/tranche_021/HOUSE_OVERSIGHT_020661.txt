if the ELF wanted a formal proposal, iam happy to do so

BTW resistance already making itself known—Texas A&M biology showed interest in hiring me but faculty
were critical of my honour killing work—particularly (as usual) my claim that victims were often beautiful—
where was my metric for beauty?—without which i was not allowed to speculate--and wasn't i disrespecting
the dead by saying they were often beautiful while still alive !!

i have thought through trans-sexuality in humans to my satisfaction—i will get back to you shortly on that

all best

one final anecdote on Trans

met a very attractive 42 year old woman in New Orleans, married, 4 children, thoroughly heterosexual—no
lesbian relationship—but she had a fantasy of being f—kid by a male -> female trans because she preferred a
cock in her but also liked a female figure, hips, ass, soft skin ete—hadn't seen that anywhere on the internet!

all best, in haste
