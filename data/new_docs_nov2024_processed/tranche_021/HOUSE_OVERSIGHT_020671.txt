The photo, taken by Fred Blackwell on May 28, 1963, shows three protesters — John Salter, Joan Trumpauer and Anne
Moody -— sitting at the counter of a white-only Woolworth’s five-and-dime store in Jackson while an angry mob pours
ketchup, sugar, and mustard on them. The three protesters were from the Tougaloo College, a black college that went on

to become the core of the civil rights movement in Mississippi.
