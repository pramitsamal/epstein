Lina Medina, born on 23 September, 1933, was the youngest woman ever to give birth. She did so when she was just 5-
years-old. Turns out Lina was born with a rare condition called ‘precocious puberty’, a condition where sexual
development happens at an early age. Lina gave birth on May 14, 1939, via a cesarean section, since her pelvis was too

small. The child, named Gerardo, was born completely healthy but the father was never found out.
