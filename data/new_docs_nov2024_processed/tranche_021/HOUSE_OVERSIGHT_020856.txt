USA Inc. | High Level Thoughts 29

Net Worth Qualifier

¢ The balance sheet / net worth calculation does not include the power to tax
— the net present value of the sovereign power to tax and the ability to print the
world’s reserve currency would clearly bolster USA Inc.’s assets — if they could be
accurately calculated.

* Plant, Property & Equipment (PP&E) on USA Inc.’s balance sheet is valued
at $829B' (or 29% of USA Inc.’s total stated assets) — this includes tangible
assets such as buildings, internal use software and civilian and military
equipment.

* The PP&E calculation DOES NOT include the value of USA Inc.’s holdings in
the likes of public land (estimated to be worth $408B per OMB)’, highways,
natural gas, oil reserves, mineral rights (estimated to be worth $345B per OMB),
forest, air space, radio frequency spectrum, national parks and other heritage and
stewardship assets which USA Inc. does not anticipate to use for general
government operations. The good news for USA Inc. is that the aggregate value
of these heritage and stewardship assets could be significant.

Note: 1) USA Inc.’s holding of land is measured in non-financial units such as acres of land and lakes, and number of National Parks and National Marine

Sanctuaries. Land under USA Inc.’s stewardship accounts for 28% of the total U.S. landmass as of 9/10. Dept. of Interior reported 552 national wildlife refuges, 378

park units, 134 geographic management areas, 67 fish hatcheries under their management as of 9/10. Dept. of Defense reported 203,000 acres of public land and

16,140,000 acres withdrawn public land, the USDA’s Forest Service managed an estimated 155 national forests, while the Dept. of Commerce had 13 National

Pp Marine Sanctuaries, which included near—shore coral reefs and open ocean, as of 9/10. Dept. of Treasury, “2010 Financial Report of the U.S. Government.”
