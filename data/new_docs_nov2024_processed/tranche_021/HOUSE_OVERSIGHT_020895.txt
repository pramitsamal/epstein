Think About That...

e Total government spending on healthcare (including Medicare, Medicaid and
other programs) has risen 7x from 1.2% of GDP in 1960 to 8.2% in 2009 while
total government spending on education has risen only 0.6x from 4% of GDP in
1960 to 6% in 2009.

e Medicare and Medicaid, which did not exist in 1960, rose to 35% of total healthcare
spending in 2009, while out-of-pocket spending declined to 12% of total healthcare
spending in 2009 (or $894 per person per year*), down from 47% in 1960 (or $478
per person’).

e Lifetime healthcare costs for the average American are $631,000, of which the
government pays for an estimated 48% while private insurers (like UnitedHealth and
Blue Cross Blue Shield) pay 32% and consumers pay just 12%.

e When citizens don’t need to pay directly for something (like healthcare) and are given
an expensive good / service for free (or well below cost), they tend to consume more
of it — it’s basic supply and demand economics.

e This approach faces increasing challenges as USA, Inc. has gone deeper and
deeper in debt to pay for it...

Note: *Adjusted for inflation, in 2005 dollars. Nominal amount would be $972 out-of-pocket healthcare spending per person in
KP 2008 and $70 per person in 1960. Source: U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
