Economic Policy—Short-Term vs. Long-Term

¢ Economic theory + experience of the Great Depression suggest
government can use fiscal policy (increase direct spending +
investment) to offset near-term shortfalls in private demand.

¢ In the long term, USA Inc. cannot sustain higher levels of direct
spending / investment without crowding out private consumption /
investment.

¢ Therefore, USA Inc. should prioritize and allocate available

resources to stimulate growth in productivity + employment, which
drive long-term GDP growth.

Note: 1) all growth numbers are rounded average annual growth rates and are adjusted for inflation. 2.83% is the average annual GDP growth rate from 1970 to
2009, per BEA. Labor force growth of 1.53% is the average annual growth rate from 1970 to 2009, per BLS. Hours worked per worker per OECD. Productivity
growth of 1.53% is calculated by subtracting employment growth and hours worked per worker growth from real GDP growth. Average annual growth rate of 1.53%
is roughly in line with other estimates such as Dale W. Jorgenson, Mun S. Ho, Kevin J. Stiroh, “Growth of U.S. Industries and Investments in Information Technology
and Higher Education” <hitp:/Avww.nber.org/chapters/c1 0627>
