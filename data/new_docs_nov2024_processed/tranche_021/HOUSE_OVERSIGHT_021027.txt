For GDP Growth & Job Creation, It’s Key for Private Industry to Remain

Incentivized to Invest in R&D

As we contemplate our future, we must accept the fact that many of the assumptions under
which business operated for the past 50 years no longer hold true...If we are committed to
investing in ideas to improve — not just maintain — what we have and what we know, the United
States will do more than just recover from this recession. We will emerge, once again, as a
competitive, global powerhouse...lnnovation...accrues to countries in proportion to the quality
and rigor of their educational systems...The future of every nation will be shaped by new ideas
and creativity. These are the engines of future prosperity.

— Paul Otellini, CEO, Intel Corporation, 2/10/09

Government targeted and ‘blue sky’ investment in technology (and defense) has led to crucial
technology inventions for America — such as ARPANET / Internet (1970s) and Global
Positioning System (1980s)..., which, on a net basis, have created jobs, wealth and related tax
revenue.

Government investment in technology remains important, but, perhaps more important,
government must help incentivize private industry (via tax policies such as allowing companies
to repatriate overseas cash at lower tax rates’ and other tools) to invest in domestic research &
development and to create jobs...and create a stable environment in which to operate.
