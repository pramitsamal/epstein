Compared to 10 Years Ago, USA is Losing Competitiveness

at the Margin vs. lts Peers

e McKinsey conducted a study in 2010 that compares the USA with other
countries on 20 attributes related to economic fundamentals, business
climate, human capital and infrastructure. McKinsey compared current
status vs. status in 2000.

e We augmented the McKinsey study with 9 additional attributes across those
aforementioned areas as well as government spending metrics.

e Through this study, we found that America, relative to other countries, improved
on none of the 29 attributes, remained the same on 9 attributes (including
GDP per capita, public debt as % of GDP, public spending on healthcare, public
spending on education, growth in local innovation clusters, population &
demographic profile, retention of foreign-born talents, total healthcare spending
and cost-adjusted labor productivity) and deteriorated on 20 (including trade
surplus, national spending on R&D, industrial production, corporate tax rate,
business environment, FDI, tax incentives for R&D, number of patent
applications, availability of high-quality labor, higher education penetration,
telecom & transportation infrastructure, etc.).
