who was also employed at Mar-a-Lago as a maintenance man-
ager. But Virginia's father saw nothing wrong with the offer, and
he drove her, later that day, to Epstein’s house on E] Brillo Way.

There, according to the document, Maxwell assured Virgin-
ia’s father that Ms. Maxwell would provide transportation home
for his teenage daughter. Then she led Virginia upstairs, to a spa
room equipped with a shower and a massage table. Jeffrey
Epstein was lying, naked, on the table.

Virginia was shocked, she says in the filing, but, with no
experience with massages, thought this could be massage ther-
apy protocol. “Ms. Maxwell then took off her own shirt and left
on her underwear and started rubbing her breasts across
[Jeffrey's] body, impliedly showing [Virginia] what she was
expected to do,” the filing continues. “Ms. Maxwell then told
[Virginia] to take off her clothes. The minor girl was apprehen-
sive about doing this, but, in fear, proceeded to follow Ms. Maxwell
by removing everything but her underwear. She was then ordered
to remove her underwear and straddle [Epstein]. The encounter
escalated, with [Jeffrey] and Ms. Maxwell sexually assaulting,
battering, exploiting, and abusing [Virginia] in various ways and
in various locations, including the steam room and the shower.
At the end of this sexually exploitive abuse, [Epstein] and
Ms. Maxwell giddily told [Virginia] to return the following day
and told her she had ‘lots of potential’ [Epstein] paid [Virginia]
hundreds of dollars, told her it was for two hours of work, and

| directed one of her employees to drive her home.”

At the time, Virginia was fifteen years old.
