(6th Cir. 2006) (“[T ]here is no question that TVA is an agency and
instrumentality of the United States.”) (internal quotes omitted).
During the period surrounding the FCPA’s adoption, state-owned
entities held virtual monopolies and operated under state-controlled
price-setting in many national industries around the world. See generally

9'To date, consistent with the approach taken by DOJ and SEC, all
district courts that have considered this issue have concluded that this is
an issue of fact fora jury to decide. See Order, United States v. Carson,

admitted to violating the FCPA by bribing officials of state-owned or
state-controlled entities. See Government's Opposition to Defendants’
