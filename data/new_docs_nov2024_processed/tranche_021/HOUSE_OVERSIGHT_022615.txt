18 US.C. § 2.

2° Tn enacting the FCPA in 1977, Congress explicitly noted that “(t]he
concepts of aiding and abetting and joint participation would apply toa
violation under this bill in the same manner in which those concepts have
always applied in both SEC civil actions and in implied private actions
brought under the securities laws generally.” H.R. Rep. No. 95-640, at 8.
°°! Pinkerton held that a conspirator may be found guilty of a substantive
offense committed by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy
if the co-conspirator'’s acts were reasonably foreseeable. See Pinkerton v.
United States, 328 U.S. 640, 647-48 (1946).

202 See United States v. MacAllister, 160 F.3d 1304, 1307 (11th Cir.
1998); United States v. Winter, 509 F.2d 975, 982 (Sth Cir. 1975).

204 Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, “Prosecution of Persons Who

Aid and Abet Violations,” explicitly provides that, for purposes ofa

civil action seeking injunctive relief or a civil penalty, “any person that
knowingly or recklessly provides substantial assistance to another person
in violation of a provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation
issued under this chapter, shall be deemed to be in violation of such
provision to the same extent as the person to whom such assistance is
provided.” Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78t(e).

°° Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the SEC may impose a
cease-and-desist order through the SEC’s administrative proceedings
upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any
provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and
upon any other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation,
due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would
contribute to such violation. Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act,15
US.C. § 78u-3{a).

206 See Complaint, SEC v. Panalpina, Inc. supra note 68.

718 US.C. § 3282(a) provides: “Except as otherwise expressly provided
by law, no person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense,

not capital, unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted
within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.”

208 See Grunewald v. United States, 353 US. 391, 396-97 (1957)
(holding government must prove conspiracy still existed and at least

one overt act was committed within the statute of limitations); Fiswick
y. United States, 329 US. 211, 216 (1946) (“The statute of limitations,
unless suspended, runs from the last overt act during the existence of

the conspiracy. The overt acts averred and proved may thus mark the
duration, as well as the scope, of the conspiracy.”) (citation omitted); see
generally Julie N. Sarnoff, Federal Criminal Conspiracy, 48 AM. CRIM. L.
Rev. 663, 676 (Spring 2011).

21S Rep. No. 95-114, at 3 (noting that, in the past, “corporate bribery
has been concealed by the falsification of corporate books and records,”
that the accounting provisions “remove [] this avenue of coverup,’ and
that “[tlaken together, the accounting requirements and criminal [anti-
bribery] prohibitions ... should effectively deter corporate bribery of
foreign government officials”).

14Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 US.C. § 78m(b)(2)(B).
715 The accounting provisions contain a narrow exemption related to
national security and the protection of classified information. Under
this “national security” provision, “no duty or liability [under Section
13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act] shall be imposed upon any person acting
in cooperation with the head of any federal department or agency
responsible for such matters if such act in cooperation with such head of
a department or agency was done upon the specific, written directive of
the head of such department or agency pursuant to Presidential authority
to issue such directives.” Section 13(b)(3) of the Exchange Act, 15 US.C.
§ 78m(b) (3). As Congress made clear, however, the exception is narrowly
tailored and intended to prevent the disclosure of classified information.

rejected the addition of proposed cost-benefit language to the definition
“in response to concerns that such a statutory provision might be abused
and weaken the accounting provisions at a time of increasing concern
about audit failures and financial fraud and resultant recommendations
by experts for stronger accounting practices and audit standards.” Jd.
