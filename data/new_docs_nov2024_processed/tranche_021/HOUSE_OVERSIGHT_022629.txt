And? What will happen? What WILL happen and what SHOULD happen are two different things. The
lamestream media will never cover this story. Nothing will come of it. To the left, this is just a ho-hum blip. i’7ll
be mega-surprised if Reuters even blinks and puts it on an inside back page. The AP won’t touch it... so? i

don’t see it making an impact on the Hill’s run — not when the media will treat it as a yawner. As a former CPS
child advocate, i can’t print here what i think ought to happen to him....

Are you self-quashing your freedom of expression or what ???? It’s not about “SHOULD” But IF he’s
impicated, but when ! More than likely Never ! “IF” you were meerly “implicated” You are automatically
publicly scorned ,forever. you will always be known to have been implicated in Child porn and also forever be
known to be a Pedophile , right ? The Evidence will never surface , or will it ? Remember that Obamacare
thingy ? It has been and always will be a lie , unless of course someone “GROWS A “F”ing PAIR” and comes
up with Documentation to prove it ! Grow a pair yourself JAYLEIGH ...... Speak up my fellow American

citizen ! “Just do it” , I double dog dare ya !

Sure lets make Hillary President so Bill can expand his sex addition. They are one sick family.
