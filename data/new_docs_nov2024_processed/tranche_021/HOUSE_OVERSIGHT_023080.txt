Cross-asset implications of repatriation

Repatriation should spur USD-buying — up to 40% may be non-USD denominated
While few companies disclose the currency composition of their offshore cash, our FX
team estimates that 60-75% is already in USD while 25-40% is non-dollar-denominated.
(If we extrapolate based on the S&P 500’s geographic revenue exposure, the largest
proportion could be in Europe, followed by emerging Asia.} This may result in upward
pressure on the USD (which they estimate could amount to $250-$400bn if half of all
offshore cash, which they estimate at ~$2tn, was repatriated). Their analysis of the
EUR-USD during the last repatriation holiday suggests an “announcement effect” is
likely, as the dollar strengthened ahead of the bulk of the actual repatriation flows.

Repatriation could put upward pressure on bank funding costs

Our rates team’s analysis of some of the largest multinationals with offshore cash
suggests ~70% of cash is invested in securities with maturities greater than one year,
with the remaining 30% having shorter maturities. See table below. They believe
repatriation could put upward pressure on bank funding costs as firms reduce their
holdings in these short-term investments. According to Crane Data on offshore money
fund holdings, our rates team cites that $161bn of offshore funds are held in commercial
paper and CDs, of which the majority are from financial institutions with Japan, France and
Canada the largest issuers.

Border adjustment tax analysis

A new tax policy outlined in the Blueprint proposal that has been getting a lot of
attention recently is the border adjustment tax, or the application of border adjustments
to a company’s imports and exports. While Trump has described the proposal as being
“too complicated,” it is a key component of the Blueprint plan and should not be
ignored. Additionally, White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s recent reference to
“..the plan taking shape right now, using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax
imports from countries...” could be a sign that Trump is not as against the proposal his
other comments would indicate.
