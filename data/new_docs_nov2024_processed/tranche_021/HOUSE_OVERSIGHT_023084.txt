line with the rest of the world on this issue. Similarly, the accelerated depreciation of
machinery & equipment would become irrelevant due to the move toward taxation
based on business cash flow and the immediate write-off of capital expenditures. Once
the depreciation from legacy investments has run off, then depreciation should become
irrelevant for tax purposes. We also highlight the deduction for US production activities
(section 199) due to it being specifically highlignted by the Blueprint proposal as no
longer being necessary under the new tax policies. Both the Blueprint and Trump have
noted that they would likely maintain the Research & Development related tax credits.

Immediate capex expensing should provide some initial cash tax benefits

The shift to the immediate expensing of capital expenditures should provide a
significant near-term reduction in cash taxes as companies benefit from the ongoing
reduction of taxable income from the depreciation of legacy assets combined with the
full expensing of new investments. As the depreciation of legacy assets rolls off, the tax
benefit would become more modest. Keep in mind that, for tax reporting, many
companies already take advantage of the accelerated depreciation schedules discussed
above. The ongoing benefit of capex expensing derives from the deferral in the timing
of tax payments.
