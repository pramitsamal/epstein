funds), but that a commercial exchange agent gave us less comfort on the sales
tax side. Leon did not want to use a gallery because he was concerned about
confidentiality and he did not want to have to ask a gallery that he did not do
much business with to act as exchange agent.

When Leon first discussed the exchange for the Cezannes with me a few
weeks ago, | asked him if he wanted to use the same exchange agent as last
year, or if he wanted to use a gallery. | said that a gallery carried little to no risk
on the sales tax side, but | reminded him that he had not wanted to use a gallery
last year for the Calder because of confidentiality reasons. He said to use the
same exchange agent as before, which made sense to me because he was
extremely concerned about confidentiality with the purchase of the Cezannes.

| will find out about sales tax audits and will let you know. The exchange agent
has had a New York resale certificate since 2014 and has been engaged in art
transactions like this since then, but | do not believe they have been audited. |
will check, though, and | will also ask the Herrick lawyer if any of his clients who
have done similar deals have been audited.

Best,

Heather
