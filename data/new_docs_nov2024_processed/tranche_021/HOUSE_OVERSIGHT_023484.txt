given electoral clout to the movement’s intellectual and constitutional
arguments.

Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, the
conservative research organization, said, “The optimistic view is that
we have a confluence of the business cycle, of the demography and of
the politics that makes it not just possible to achieve real change, but
impossible that we not deal with these things if we want this country
to continue on the path envisioned by the founders.” So just two and
a half years after a presidential election that was in part a repudiation
of conservative governance, and with the nation still smarting from
the aftereffects of a financial crisis that grew out of failures of
markets and regulation, President Obama finds himself in a somewhat
surprising position: forced to articulate and sell a vision of how
liberalism and the institutions it built in the 20th century can be
updated for the constraints of the 21st.

The speech he delivered Wednesday at George Washington
University in Washington was his most ambitious effort so far to do
so. In it, he harnessed the language of both left and right to argue
against the extremes on both sides while suggesting that many of
their core principles were not mutually exclusive — in other words,
that Great Society values can endure in a Tea Party moment.

He defined “patriotism” as a shared sense of responsibility for the
vulnerable and less fortunate. Basic standards of security for the
elderly and poor and government investment in a more prosperous
future, he said, can not only coexist with a tradition of “rugged
individualists with a healthy skepticism of too much government,”
but are also a vital part of what makes America exceptional.

“We are a better country because of these commitments,” he said.
“T’ll go further — we would not be a great country without those
commitments.”
