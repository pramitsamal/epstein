J Street, the left-leaning alternative to the more established American
Israel Public Affairs Committee, put out a statement of support for
Mr. Obama on Wednesday. “To oppose the president without laying
out a credible alternative basis for a two-state solution is to embrace a
status quo leading to the eventual loss of Israel as we know and love
it,” its statement said.

Mr. Obama’s proposal, the group said, is supported by many Jews in
the United States and Israel. It is “the path that most of Israel’s recent
prime ministers have attempted to blaze, from Rabin to Barak to
Olmert.”

Republicans, however, are confident that their emphasis on
unconditional support for Israel holds appeal both for many Jews and
for conservative Christians.

Yet it is the Republican Party’s close identification with evangelical
Christians in recent years that is perhaps its biggest hurdle to winning
over significant numbers of Jewish voters and donors. On issues that
are crucial to the conservative Republican base — like opposition to
abortion, gay rights, liberalized immigration and much government
spending — most American Jews are on the other side, and strongly
SO.

“If Republicans can mischaracterize this president as anti-Israel, they
can distract from the fact that on every other issue their party is in
disagreement with the American-Jewish community,” said David A.
Harris, president of the National Jewish Democratic Council, a group
of Jewish-American Democratic activists.

Mr. Netanyahu on Monday experienced first-hand the tension arising
from that complaint among Democrats, and Republicans’ rejection of
it, in a private meeting he held with representatives of the National
Jewish Democratic Council and the Republican Jewish Coalition to
underscore American Jews’ bipartisan consensus on Israel.
