The number of Palestinians living west of the Jordan River is
growing rapidly and fundamentally reshaping the demographic
realities of both Israel and the Palestinian territories, Obama told
members of AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobbying group, on May 22. This
will make it harder and harder, without a peace deal, to maintain
Israel as both a Jewish state and a democratic state.

An eternal truth of Middle East politics is that the Palestinians never
miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Lately, though, this has
become an Israeli specialty. If Israel misses the chance this year to set
the Palestinians on a course toward independence, it will jeopardize
its future as a Jewish democracy.

A Magnanimous Vision

Yes, it will be dangerous for Israel to return to its 1967 borders, or
anything close. The potential merger between Hamas and the more
moderate Fatah is cause for despair, but it should spur Netanyahu to
try to split the moderates from the radicals by offering a
magnanimous vision for peace. He should realize that it will be fatal
for Israel to maintain control over millions of Palestinians who seek
what the people of Yemen and Libya and Syria seek: freedom.
Absent any hope of progress, the Palestinians will do what they can
to undermine Israel. But all they have to do is wait.
