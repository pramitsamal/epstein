Hamas' Gaza strongman criticizes Khalid
Meshal

25 May 2011 -- Differences and clashes within the Hamas movement
have come to light for the first time, with Hamas senior figures
verbally sparring and exchanging criticism in the media. This is
particularly surprising as Hamas is known for the discipline of its
cadres and members.

In an interview carried by the Lebanese Al-Akhbar newspaper on
Tuesday, Zahar criticized the statements made by Hamas leader
Khalid Meshal on 4 May in Cairo during the signing of the
reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas. Zahar said that
Khalid Meshal did not have any right to say that Hamas would give
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas another chance to try to
negotiate a peace deal with Israel.

In the interview, Zahar reportedly said we didn't know and were not
consulted about the position of Khalid Meshal, and this is not the
correct position. He added we haven't given any chance for
negotiations on behalf of us or the Palestinian people. Our program is
against negotiations in this way, because they are a waste of time.
Zahar was also quoted as saying that the Hamas power structure
should be re-assessed as the leadership is here [in the Gaza Strip],
and the part (of Hamas) that is abroad is just a part of that.
Speaking to Asharg Al-Awsat, Hamas political bureau member Izzat

stressed that these statements do not represent the position of the
Hamas movement.

Al-Rashag told Asharg Al-Awsat that the statements made by
