Observers offer fresh insight for new era

Intellectual hails progress
made in past while warning
of challenges that lie ahead

Robert Lawrence Kuhn has many
titles, ranging from investment
banker to anatomy researcher. But
he is better known in China asa spe-
cialist who knows the country
inside out.

Over the past 29 years, he has
visited almost every provincial
region and spoken with people from
all walks of life, including some who
have gone on to become State lead-
ers.

“Tt’s been a great gift to my life to
be able to learn so much about Chi-
na’s rich civilization, political theo-
ries and the whole development,” he
said.

Kuhn, who is from the United
States, learns as an outsider but
communicates as an insider. In his
talk show Closer to China with R.L.
Kuhn on the China Global Televi-
sion Network, he presents China’s
complex story to the world through
candid, intimate discussions with
the country’s decision-makers.

In a hotel suite in Wangfujing,
downtown Beijing, one busy lunch-
time last week, Kuhn shared his
thoughts on Chinese politics with
China Daily, between exercising and
a meeting of the Communist Party
of China, which he had been invited
to attend as an observer.

He spoke passionately about the
19th CPC National Congress, which
was held in Beijing in October,
describing it as “a milestone con-
gress that set the agenda for more
than 30 years”.

The Party proposed two new con-
cepts at the congress — “a new era
of socialism with Chinese charac-
teristics” and Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism with Chinese Charac-
teristics for a New Era, which has
been written into the Party Consti-
tution.

“To understand China today, it is
critical to appreciate what the new
era means. ... I like to understand
new era in two categories: its char-
acteristics at home and abroad, and
its timeline,” Kuhn said.

He has obviously developed his
own way of explaining terms with
Chinese characteristics. That is to
break down the characteristics,
domestically and internationally,
rather than delve into the term.

He listed a number of challenges
in China’s new era, from pollution to
medical care, among which he said
the biggest is the rising expectations
of the people at home, because “now
that the people have some, they
want more”.

The complex international envi-
ronment is the main characteristic
of the new era, as the world is frag-
mented by diverse problems and
challenges, he said.

While explaining what he called
the timeline of the new era (2017,
2021, 2049) and expounding his
understanding of Xi Jinping

I like to understand

new era in two catego-
ries: its characteristics
at home and abroad,
and its timeline.”

banker and anatomy researcher

Q&A | ROBERT
LAWRENCE KUHN

You hold multiple titles now.
How have you managed to
master so many different
fields? Do they have any-
thing in common?

There's one word to describe
the commonality, that is “pas-
sion” Whatever I’ve done I
want to have passion for it. To
expand that a bit, it’s the pas-
sion to learn. 'm not here to
teach, I love to learn. When I
write a new book, it’s some-
thing I want to learn about. I
use that vehicle to learn. So
passion about learning is the
common denominator. China
has given me a hugely rich life
because of everything I’ve
learned here.

Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era —
which he broke down into three cat-
egories: serve the people, national
rejuvenation, and governance mod-
ernization — Kuhn showcased his
knowledge of the Party’s files, which
he has clearly learned by heart.

He recited almost every key
point of the 68-page report Xi
delivered to the congress in Octo-
ber. More important, he made con-
nections between these points,
presenting them in a vivid way, sea-
soned with personal experiences
and thinking.

When asked about the effects of
the anti-corruption campaign, he
immediately listed 10 objectives.
That's his style of approaching Chi-
nese issues — divergent thinking
and a vigilance not to lose sight of
the connections between different

points.

British journalist tells China’s story to the world

By LIUXUAN

Despite living and working in Chi-
na for a decade, Andrew Moody’s abil-
ity to speak Mandarin is still at a basic
level. Yet that has not stopped the
award-winning journalist from inter-
preting China’s story for the world.

Moody joined China Daily nine
years ago and is now a senior corre-
spondent. He has written more than
150 cover stories for the paper’s Euro-
pean Weekly and African Weekly,
examining a wide range of issues
including the Belt and Road Initiative.

The job has provided him with first-
hand experience of how China is
developing as well as the chance to
record reactions from the outside
world, especially in the West, toward
the nation’s growth and changes.

He was at the Great Hall of the
People to hear General Secretary
Xi Jinping deliver a report to the
19th National Congress of the Com-
munist Party of China in October,
when the concept of a “new era” was
first mentioned.

“The consensus of the various peo-
ple I spoke to in the hours after the
speech was that China's entering anew
era could be a momentous turning
point in world history,’ Moody said.

According to his interviews, he
said, people believe that a more confi-
dent China is striding into a world
that it also is helping to shape.

Moody has his own understanding
of the new era. With 40 years of
reform and opening-up, he said China
has reached a point where it can move
on in many ways, such as in foreign
policy, global governance and domes-

ticreforms. “China has reached anew
junction and has to move forward.”

The British journalist has written
many stories that explain China tothe
rest of the world, and these have
brought him many honors, including
being named a State High-End
Project Foreign Expert.

“J like reporting on China because
it’s perhaps the 21st century’s most
fascinating story,” he said. “The real

Q&A
ANDREW MOODY

How do you overcome the
challenges of showing the
real China to the world,
especially to those who have
biases against China?

It's a long-term thing, and
you cannot change this over-
night. There are negative per-
ceptions about China. It’s
about engagement. If China
has much more interactions
with the rest of the world, then
people will see China as it
actually is. One of the 2035
objectives is to better increase
China’s soft power. Organiza-
tions like China Daily can actu-
ally play a role in improving
China’s soft power. But I do
think it’s a long-term process,
and China doesn’t need to be
too sensitive toward criticism.

nating story of China merging into
the 21st century, the stories that may-
be Western media don’t really have
the chance to interview.”

Moody sees his task as communi-
cating China to a global audience, and
there are still a number of things that
need to be done, he said.

“I go back to the UK quite a lot, and
I still don’t think that people are
aware of the impact of a much bigger
Chinese economy and China’s being a
more significant player in the world,”
hesaid. “AllI can doisto reportand do
stories one by one.”

Broadcaster sees choice and confidence in rising nation

By YANG WANGLI
yangwangli@chinadaily.com.cn

For 20 years, Liu Xin has had a sin-
gular goal: to build a bridge of under-
standing between China and the
outside world.

The television presenter began
working for China Central TV, the
State broadcaster, in 1997, two years
after becoming the first Chinese to
take part in — and win — the Interna-
tional Public Speaking Competition.

Early last year, her desire to share
China’s story received a major boost
when she was chosen to host The
Point, a prime-time discussion show
that airs weekdays on the China Glob-
al Television Network.

She said that China entering a new
era means three things: opportunities,
challenges and responsibilities.

“My winning speech in that 1995
national competition was about
choice,” she said. “After 15 years of
reform and opening-up, we Chinese
now enjoy an abundance of choice in
our daily lives”

After listening to General Secretary
Xi Jinping’s report at the opening of

the 19th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, Liu said
she was impressed with his use of the
word “confidence”.

“Tt’s the confidence China has devel-
oped through knowing that our sys-
tem works. The confidence about who
weare as a people, as a culture. And it’s
the confidence about our future role in
the world,” she said.

“As media workers, we believe we
have a great story to tell. In the past,
people relied on a few correspondents
or experts for information and opin-
ions on China. But more people are
tuning in to Chinese media for infor-
mation, both traditional platforms
such as TV and online.”

As more questions emerge in the
minds of those watching from outside
China, Liu said the opportunities to
tell stories from inside the country are
growing. However, so too are the chal-
lenges.

“Because of the ideological differen-
ces between China and the West, Chi-
na has always been the subject of
‘Western media criticism, which is
often downright bashing based on
falsehoods,” she said.

Now that China has defied all kinds
of predictions of a collapse or econom-
ic hard landing, Western observers are
having a hard time explaining the Chi-
na phenomenon, she said, adding that
the result is an ignorance-based supe-
riority complex mixed with bewilder-
ment and iced with jealousy.

During her 30-minute program, Liu
conducts live interviews with guests in
the studio or via satellite link to get a
Chinese perspective on two to three top-
ics that affect people around the world.

“T understand the urgency to be
more assertive, but I believe we always
need to be aware of the danger of put-
ting feelings before reason, putting
opinions before facts,” she said.
“Nationalism is my biggest enemy.

“President Xi has said we need to
improve the quality and effect of devel-
opment. I believe this also applies to
China’s international communication.
The Chinese people will work hard
toward a community of ashared future,
regardless of how others view us.”

Meanwhile, Liu has a job to do. “Asa
journalist, our duty is to tell China’s
story as it is, one topic at a time, one
show at a time,” she added.

China has always been
the subject of Western
media criticism,
which is often
downright bashing
based on falsehoods.”

Q&A | LIUXIN

As a professional journalist,
what do you think China's
mainstream media could do
to better report China to the
outside world in such a media
transformation age?

It’s challenging. I think we
need to be aware of new tech-
nology. And the content is very
important. If we’re more confi-
dent, we can really be more
sincere, be more at ease with
our problems and our achieve-
ments. So let’s have a sincere
conversation, not shy away
from the problems we're fac-
ing. That’s why I say let’s tell
the China story as it is. It’s not
100 percent about achieve-
ments. Every day we see mixed
news, we have mixed feelings,
so let’s be factual, let’s be sin-
cere and let people decide
whether they want to watch us
or not. This is going to take
time, but I think if we follow
the right philosophy, the right
steps, we're going to make it.

What they say

Vision Chi-
nais the
first high-
end event
organized
by China
Daily and
UIBE after the two sides
launched a partnership. By
telling China's stories in an
objective and rational manner,
it aims to help students get to
know a real China and an
objective world, and to under-
stand China in the new era.
Wang Jiaqiong, president of
the University of International
Business and Economics

I've learned
alot from
Vision Chi-
na today.
What
impressed
me most is
how to eliminate bias against
China when telling China's
stories. The three experts
shared a common opinion,
which is to show a true China
and not care too much about
comments from the outside
world. The sincerest story is
often the most touching one.
Zhu Yue, a senior student
majoring in international poli-
tics from Beijing International
Studies University

Itwas an
interesting
lecture. It
was good to
understand
certain
aspects
about China. It would be good
to have things like this abroad
because it's about China. You
don’t have to explain China to
the Chinese people, but you
need to explain it to the out-
side world.

ing, and everyone is interest-
ed. | enjoyed hearing the
