Robert Lawrence Kuhn / RLK:
Everybody is pleased that there is
the pause; 90 days is very short,
of course. We have to look at the
short-term, mid-term, and long-
term. Let’s look at the
background to understand where
China is today. This is the 40%
year, the anniversary, of China’s
reform and opening up. On
December 18*, 1978, Deng
Xiaoping made his famous
speech, which transformed China
from ideologically driven class
struggle into economic
development. It’s a big deal in
China; there’s a big celebration
coming up.

RLK: President Xi Jinping has said
that the first big goal for China, in
2020, is to have a moderately
prosperous society, specifically to
eliminate all extreme poverty in
China. That means they will have
taken 800 million people out of
poverty. So that’s their overview,
and so they look at the status quo
that they’ve had with America as
something that’s good for both
sides.
