This list may be somewhat inaccurate since it is taken from a list of
possible majors, which is not the same thing as a list of departments.
I just edited it to reflect my memory of Yale, which could conceivably
have added a new department or two since I was there 20 years ago
(but departments are not easily created or deleted at Yale).

Now let’s ask what would happen if we reorganized.

Which departments specialize in prediction, for example? Clearly,
economics is about prediction, as is physics, and sociology, and psy-
chology, and any branch of engineering.

Which departments specialize in judgment? Law does certainly.
Medicine, parts of psychology, parts of anthropology, aspects of statis-
tics, architecture, and art history do so, as do many others.

Which departments specialize in modeling? Computer science
certainly does, as do parts of psychology. Engineering disciplines do
and nearly all of the sciences do. Economics and sociology do as well.

Which departments specialize in experimentation? All of the sci-
ences, plus psychology, do experiments. Economics and sociology
people sometimes do them. Political scientists do experiments.

Which departments specialize in describing? The humanities spe-
cialize in this, as do English and Italian, and Near Eastern languages,
and linguistics, and anthropology. Parts of psychology and medicine
and law do as well.

Where is diagnosis practiced? In medicine, of course, but also in
law, business, and engineering.

Where is planning studied and practiced? In engineering and in
architecture certainly, but also in business, medicine, computer sci-
ence, and psychology.
