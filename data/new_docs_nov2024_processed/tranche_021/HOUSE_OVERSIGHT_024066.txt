or any other board or committee formed to assist or advise the
General Partner, each Limited Partner that designated a
member of the Advisory Board, and each partner, member,
stockholder, director, officer, manager, trustee, employee, agent
and affiliate of any of the foregoing shall be indemnified by the
Fund against any claim, demand, controversy, dispute, cost,
loss, damage, expense (including attorneys’ fees), judgment
and/or liability incurred by or imposed upon the indemnitee in
connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which the
indemnitee may be made a party or otherwise involved or with
which the indemnitee shall be threatened, in connection with
their activities on behalf of, or their association with, the Fund;
provided, however, that such an indemnitee, other than an
indemnitee acting in his capacity as a member of the Advisory
Board or any other board or committee formed to assist or
advise the General Partner and a Limited Partner who has
designated such member, shall not be indemnified with respect
to matters as to which the indemnitee shall have been finally
adjudicated in any such action, suit or proceeding (a) not to
have acted in good faith and in the reasonable belief that the
indemnitee’s action was in, or not opposed to, the best interests
of the Fund or (b) to have committed a breach of such person’s
fiduciary duty (if any) to the Fund, gross negligence, intentional
misconduct, intentional and material breach by such person of
its obligations under the Partnership Agreement (provided that
such breach is not cured within 60 days of notice from a
majority in interest of the Limited Partners of such breach), a
willful violation of law or the commission of a felony. An
indemnitee either acting in his capacity as a member of the
Advisory Board or any other board or committee formed to
assist or advise the General Partner or that is a Limited Partner
who has designated such member shall not be indemnified with
respect to matters as to which the indemnitee shall have been
finally adjudicated in any such action, suit or proceeding (1) not
to have acted in good faith and in the reasonable belief that the
indemnitee’s action was in, or not opposed to, the best interests
of the Fund or (2), with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, such person had reasonable cause to believe that his
or her conduct was unlawful.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Fund
provide indemnification to any indemnitee for any action or
omission taken by such indemnitee in such person’s capacity as
a director of any portfolio company in which the Fund no
longer holds an investment, to the extent such liabilities solely
relate to activities of such person during the period
commencing 18 months after the date on which the Fund has
sold or otherwise disposed of its entire interest in such portfolio
