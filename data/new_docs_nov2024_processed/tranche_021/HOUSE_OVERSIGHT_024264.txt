Day 5: Internet Architecture/Net Neutrality

We increasingly assume the availability of commodity networking -- a flat fee for access -- even
as the way in which we experience the Internet is evolving through a curious microeconomics, a
mishmash of policies designed to subsidize or regulate access, and a sometime ability to
arbitrage around arrangements through technologies to facilitate access sharing and virtual
tunneling.

How is Internet access likely to evolve, and what choices exist for polities with particular ideals
about how it should work?

Discussion will include Andy Ellis, Berkman Klein Center Fellow and CSO of Akamai, one of the
most important companies that people haven’t heard of.
