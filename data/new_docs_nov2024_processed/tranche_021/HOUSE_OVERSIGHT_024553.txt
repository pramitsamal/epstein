establishment of reasonably necessary reserves as determined by the General Partner. The General
Partner will make distributions at such times as determined by the General Partner.

Distributions will be made in the following priority:

« First, to the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner in proportion to and to the extent
of their unreturned capital contributions, but in no case may a distribution pursuant to this bullet
exceed a Partner's positive adjusted capital account balance;

« Second, pursuant to Subsections (a) and (b} in proportion as follows: (a) to the Common Limited
Partners and the General Pariner in proportion to and to the extent of their undistributed
Preferred Returns; and (b) to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in an amount equal to (i) the
number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, divided by the number of all
outstanding Units other than Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, multiplied by
(ii) the amount distributed pursuant to Subsection (a) of this bullet, multiplied by (iii} a fraction to
be provided by the Profits Participation Limited Partner; provided, however, that the fraction shall
not exceed 2/Tiths (unless the Independent Committee has increased the number of Profits
Participation LP Units beyond the number initially authorized, in which case the maximum fraction
authorized for this purpose would be increased appropriately);

e Third, to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in an amount equal to: (a) the number of Units
held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, divided by the number of all outstanding Units
other than Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, multiplied by (b) the amount
distributed pursuant to Subsection (a) of the above bullet from the inception of KUE, multiplied by
(c) a number (expressed as a fraction) equal to 1 minus the fraction used in clause (fii) of the prior
bullet for the same distribution (unless the Independent Committee has increased the number of
Profits Participation LP Units beyond the number initially authorized, in which case the maximum
fraction for this purpose would be modified appropriately), less (d) all amounts previously
distributed to the Profits Participation Limited Partner pursuant to this bullet; and

« Fourth, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits Participation Limited Partner, and the
General Partner in proportion to the number of Units held by each such Partner.

“Preferred Return” means (as to a Common Limited Partner and the General Partner) an amount equal to
eight percent (8%) per annum, determined on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
for the actual number of days in the period for which the Preferred Return is being determined and be
cumulative on the capital contributions of such Partners and shall be calculated from the date of such
Pariner’s capital contribution; provided however that in the case of Common LP Units issued upon the
conversion of preferred limited partner units at the initial closing of the offering, that the date of Capital
Contribution shall be deemed to be the date of the initial closing of the offering solely for purposes of
calculating the Preferred Return.

To the extent, at the time of any distribution or income or loss allocation pursuant to the Partnership
Agreement, the 2/11ths portion of the Profits Participation LP Units has not then been fully allocated by
KULG LLC-1 to employees, officers, directors, consultants and agents of KUE, its subsidiaries or joint
ventures, then the distribution or income or loss allocation that would otherwise be attributable to such
unallocated portion of the Profits Participation LP Units shall be reallocated among the Common Limited
Partners and the General Partner in proportion fo their Units for purposes of such distribution or income
or loss allocation (including in connection with their Preferred Return).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Limited Partnership Agreement gives the General Partner the authority
to override the distribution provisions of the Limitation Partnership Agreement described above in order to
achieve the desired economic arrangement of KUE, which is: (i) first, to return the Partners’ Capital
Contributions to them; (ii) second, for the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner to receive
their Preferred Return while the Profits Participation Limited Partner concurrently receives an amount
equal to a fraction of the amount the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner received
