In the event that a sale of KUE or an initial Listing has not occurred within nine years from the date the
first Investors are admitted to KUE, the Independent Committee shall determine whether to pursue a sale
of KUE {or an Initial Listing or a dual track process). A majority vote of the Independent Committee on
this issue shall be binding on the Board of Directors of the General Partner and will require the Board of
Directors of the General Partner to pursue such action within ninety (90) days.

14.14, Equal Merger Consideration Provision

The Principals (through KUE LLC) and the Investors will receive the same consideration per Common LP
Unit and/or Class A/Class B Shares in connection with a sale, merger, recapitalization, share repurchase,
dividend, or any other transaction where all holders of Common LP Units or shares in the General Partner
receive consideration with respect to their Common LP Units or shares, other than with respect to
corporate restructuring transactions, such as a holding company merger, conversion of KUE from an
exempted limited partnership to a corporation or other entity, change of domicile, or any other transaction
that the Independent Committee determines is a “corporate restructuring.” In any such corporate
restructuring transaction, the Principals (through KUE LLC) may receive securities with high-voting rights
and the Investors may receive securities with limited or no voting rights so long as the consideration
received by the Principals (through KUE LLC) and the other Partners per Common LP Unit have
substantially equivalent economic provisions, it being understood that securities with high-voting rights
shall not be deemed to have a higher economic value than securities with limited or no voting righis solely
by reason of the disparity in voting rights.

14.15. Related Party Transactions

Related party transactions include transactions between (1) any of the Principals or any affiliates or any
entity controlled by any of the Principals, and (2) KUE or any direct or indirect subsidiary or joint venture
of KUE involving more than $1 million (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any merger, acquisition,
asset purchase or similar transaction between KUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures, on the one hand,
and any person of which fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting stock (or similar voting interests) is
owned by KUE LLC or its affiliates, on the other hand). Related party transactions do not include (a} any
transaction solely between or among KUE and any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or joint ventures in
which the Principals do not have any direct or indirect ownership interest (other than as a result of their
ownership in the General Partner and KUE), (b) reasonable and customary director, advisory board
member, or consultant compensation and benefits (including, without limitation, retirement, health, stock
option and other benefit plans) as approved by the Independent Committee, provided that any such
compensation, benefits and arrangements to the Principals that do not exceed $1 million in the aggregate
annually shall not be subject to such approval and customary indemnification arrangements, (c)
transactions and arrangements pursuant to or contemplated by express terms of the Limited Partnership
Agreement of KUE, including the Investment in Subsidiaries and “Co-Invest Right described below, and
any payments pursuant thereto, (d) agreements, transactions and arrangements described in “Related
Party Transactions” in this Private Placement Memorandum {including any indemnification arrangements,
the Fixed Overhead Payment described above and other arrangements and transactions described
therein) and any amendment thereto (so long as such amendment is not disadvantageous to the
investors as a whole in any material respect) or any transaction contemplated thereby and any payments
pursuant thereto, and (e) admissions of any affiliate of the Principals te KUE as a Limited Partner on
terms substantially equivalent to concurrent admissions of persons that are not affiliates of the Principals.

If the size of the related party transaction is greater than $1 million and equal to or less than $50 million,
then either (a) the Independent Committee must approve the transaction or (b) the transaction must be
approved by the holders of a majority of the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the Principals.

If the size of the related party transaction is greater than $50 million, then the transaction must be

approved by both (a} the Independent Committee and (b) the holders of a majority of the Common LP
Units unaffiliated with the Principals.
