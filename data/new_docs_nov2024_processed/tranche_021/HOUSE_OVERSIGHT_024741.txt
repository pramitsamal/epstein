ACKRELL
CAPITAL CHAPTER VI U.S. and International Cannabis Market Estimates

m U.S. State-Legal Cannabis Market

More than 97% of the U.S. population lives in a state or district (District of Columbia) with at least
one law that permits the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing or possession of cannabis or con-
centrates. As described in more detail in Chapter IV, U.S. Legal Landscape, most of these laws are
medical laws, and only eight states have enacted recreational laws. While the overall state-legal market
has grown significantly, the addressable market has been constrained due to the lack of access to purely
recreational consumers and the sometimes-narrow scope of medical conditions that qualify a patient
to access medical cannabis.

We estimate that the 2017 U.S. state-legal cannabis market was $8.0 billion, with more than four
million consumers. The breakdown of this estimate by state is shown in the following chart.

Recreational Sales as a Key Market Driver

Of the eight states that have enacted recreational laws, all had previously implemented medical laws.
As shown in the following graphs for the three largest states to implement recreational laws, imple-
mentation of a recreational law significantly expanded the overall size of the legalized cannabis market,
doubling the size of the market in each of these states in the first full calendar year after implementa-
tion. In addition, the percentage of the total market attributable to recreational consumers increased
quickly. This indicates significant, pent-up consumer demand for legal cannabis in the United States,
and we expect a significant increase in the size of the overall state-legal market as more states implement
recreational laws.
