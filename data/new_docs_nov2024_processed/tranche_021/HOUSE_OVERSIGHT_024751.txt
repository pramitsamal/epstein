illustrate the impact of varying these factors with the following sensitivity analysis, which shows the
estimated market size at maturity using a range of penetration rates and monthly spending weighted

averages.

Based on the preceding assumptions and methodology, we believe that the international legal can-
nabis market for select countries with medical or recreational laws and certain countries we believe
may develop into legal markets for cannabis has the potential to exceed $200 billion within the next
10 to 15 years. And as discussed earlier in this chapter, we forecast the U.S. legal cannabis market to
reach more than $100 billion in this same period. Together, these two forecasts indicate a global legal
cannabis market in the foreseeable future of more than $300 billion.

In our view, most countries located in Asia will take the longest to enact and implement cannabis
access laws; therefore, we have not included the markets in countries such as China, with a population
of 1.4 billion people, or Japan, with the third highest GDP in the world, in our global market estimate.
If cannabis legalization continues in the United States and the rest of the world as we anticipate, we
believe that many countries in Asia will ultimately follow suit. If and when that occurs, the size of the
global legal cannabis market will increase significantly and, we believe, may ultimately exceed $500
billion annually.

As discussed on page 175, readers are cautioned to not place undue reliance on our opinions, pre-
dictions or estimates. Almost certainly, our opinions, predictions and estimates will prove inaccurate in
some respects. A number of factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those
indicated by our opinions, predictions and estimates. U.S. states and countries abroad may reverse
their cannabis legalization efforts. The medical efficacy of cannabis may not prove to be significant.
Cannabis may never be legalized federally in the United States. Certain factors affecting the cannabis
industry are discussed in more detail in Chapter [X, Cannabis Industry Risk Factors.
