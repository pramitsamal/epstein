CA TA CHAPTER VII Capital Markets for Cannabis Companies

the NYSE are two of the largest and most recognized stock exchanges in the world, with stringent
listing, trading and corporate governance requirements. Conversely, the OTC has much less stringent
requirements; as a result, most publicly traded cannabis-related companies are traded on the OTC.

In Canada, cannabis-related companies are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the TSX
Venture Exchange (TSXV), which is an affiliate of the TSX, and the Canadian Securities Exchange
(CSE). The TSX is one of the world’s largest stock exchanges and, similar to Nasdaq and the NYSE,
has stringent listing, trading and corporate governance requirements. The TSXV focuses on companies
with small market capitalization and has less stringent listing requirements than the TSX. The CSE is
focused on micro capitalization and emerging growth companies, and it has the least stringent listing
requirements of the primary Canadian exchanges. In order to be listed on either the TSX or the TSXV,
a company is required to be in compliance with Canada’s Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes
Regulations (ACMPR) and all applicable laws in jurisdictions within which it operates. (Operations
of listed companies are restricted in jurisdictions, such as the United States, where cannabis is federally
prohibited.) Unlike the TSX and TSXV, the CSE has allowed companies listed on its exchange to invest
in, acquire and otherwise operate cannabis-related businesses in the United States.

The following table provides a summary of the cannabis-related companies traded on U.S., Cana-
dian and Australian stock markets. As stated previously, many cannabis-related companies are traded
on more than one market to attract additional investors and facilitate trading in multiple jurisdictions.
For example, most companies traded on the Canadian markets are also traded on the OTC.
