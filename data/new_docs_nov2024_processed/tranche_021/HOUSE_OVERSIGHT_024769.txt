CA TA CHAPTER VII Capital Markets for Cannabis Companies

m Private Capital Markets

The cannabis industry today is replete with early-stage private companies seeking to raise capital. This
capital, whether equity or debt, may be available from (i) “friends and family,” (ii) more formalized
groups and networks of “angel” investors, (iii) family offices, (iv) dedicated cannabis investment funds
(currently few in number, but growing), and (v) strategic investors. However, because of the legal
considerations, traditional institutional investors—most notably the venture capital and private equity
communities— continue to be mostly absent from the market.

As with most early-stage companies in other industries, many emerging cannabis-related companies
are trying to follow the typical progression of raising equity capital, as illustrated in the following chart.

The following table provides a summary of the reported capital (equity and debt) raised by private
cannabis-related companies in 2016 and year to date through November 30, 2017. While the table
indicates that significant capital is available in the private markets, we believe that the dearth of acces-
sible institutional capital makes it challenging for many companies to raise subsequent rounds of financ-
ing after successfully securing their start-up capital. In addition, the amount raised per transaction is
small and there have been very few announced financings of meaningful size by private companies.
While we believe that the data is informative, it is challenging to get accurate and comprehensive data
for the number and dollar amount of transactions that occur in private markets within the cannabis
industry because of the number of transactions that are not reported.
