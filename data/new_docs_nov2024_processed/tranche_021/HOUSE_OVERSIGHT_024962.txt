Is This the End of the Assad Dynasty?

2011-05-06 -- The disturbances started in mid-March in Daraa, a
southern city on the border with Jordan, when a dozen children were
manhandled, arrested and carried off to Damascus for scribbling
hostile graffiti on a wall. Distraught parents came down into the street
to vent their anger at such heavy-handed brutality. They were soon
joined by others. The uprising had begun and soon spread across the
country. No doubt it was inspired, in part at least, by the display of
people power which has leapt with contagious speed from one
country to another, shaking the foundations of Arab autocracy and
giving a great jolt to the immobile political order in the Middle East.
In Syria, the authorities then made what may prove to be a fatal
mistake. In a move that looked like panic, the security forces used
live fire against the protesters -- and have continued to do so. By the
end of April, over 550 people had been killed in different locations
around the country, while many more were wounded and possibly
two thousand arrested. With little reliable information coming out of
Syria it is impossible to be certain of the figures. The state used
particular violence against Daraa, a poor city in an agricultural region
which has suffered from government neglect and crippling drought in
recent years. As if to punish it for initiating the troubles, tank fire was
used to quell the protests and something like a siege put in place.
Electricity and water were cut off and food became scarce.

processions that followed -- have clearly aroused great rage in the
population and a thirst for revenge. President Bashar al-Assad’s
legitimacy has been eroded. A strident call is ringing out increasingly
