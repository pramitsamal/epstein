1. The use of force by Israeli defense forces during the raid was
unnecessary and disproportionate. This could have been avoided, but
Israeli forces chose not to.

2. It would be appropriate for Israel to pay some sort of compensation
to the families of those who were killed during the raid.

3. Israel should also issue a statement of regret over the incident.

The report's recommendations fail to meet Turkey's demands. Even
before the report was issued the Israeli government acknowledged
that the use of force in the raid was excessive and unnecessary, albeit
not publicly, so on that point the report paraphrases something
already known. Payment to the families of the victims is also
something Israel agreed to before the report. In respect to an official
apology, central to Turkey's demands, the report adopts an evasive
approach and instead of recommending an apology, puts emphasis
upon a statement of regret. Turkey has said before that this will not
be satisfactory.

Therefore the report as a whole makes recommendations contrary to
Turkey's demands and supports Israel's position. The statements in
the report that justify Israel's blockade of Gaza especially please
Israel. Sadly, Turkey's legal objections to the blockade no longer bear
any political significance.

As expected, following the release of the report, Turkey has
toughened its stance with Israel. While Turkish foreign policy has not
wavered despite the report's findings, the government has also stated
that it does not recognize the report's validity. Shortly after the leak,
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu announced a package of
sanctions against Israel. Turkey first downgraded its diplomatic ties
with Israel, and the minister also declared that Turkey would take
appropriate measures for safe navigation on the high seas in the
eastern Mediterranean. Military agreements between Turkey and
Israel have been suspended. Turkey will not recognize the Gaza
