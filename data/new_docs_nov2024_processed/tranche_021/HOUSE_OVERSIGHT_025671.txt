= Miners use highly specialized computers designed to run an algorithm that attempts to solve a cryptographic puzzle in order
to add a new block on the blockchain. By design, a bitcoin block is created once every ten minutes.

= The computing power required to solve the cryptographic puzzle is high and expensive; bitcoin mining consumes an
estimated $1.3bn worth of electricity annually!—equivalent to Ireland’s annual electricity consumption.

 In order to incentivize mining, the first miner to complete a block is rewarded 12.5 bitcoins. The global supply of bitcoins is
capped at 21mil (currently ~16.5m) and follows a predetermined growth rate—the miners’ rewards halve every four years.

 Given ~1-1.5m mining units globally, the likelihood of any one miner solving a block is low. Many miners join “mining
pools,” which are cooperatives which share block rewards proportionate to contributed mining power.

— Mining pools are highly concentrated; the top four pools represent over 50% of total mining power.
