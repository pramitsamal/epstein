Sovereign Currencies Meet Three Criteria Division

1) They are used as a medium of exchange.

— To represent a medium of exchange, an instrument must facilitate the transaction
of goods or services between parities (US$ are used to buy a barrel of oil).

2) They serve as unit of account.

— A unit of account is a measurement which allows value to be accounted and
compared (a barrel of WTI is worth ~$55).

3) They are a store of value.

— Astore of value is an asset that can be saved, stored, and exchanged in the future
for a predictable stable value (with 2% annual inflation, a nominal dollar today
will be worth 82¢ in 10 years).
