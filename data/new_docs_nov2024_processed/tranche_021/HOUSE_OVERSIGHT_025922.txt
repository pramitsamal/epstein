>> After reading this chapter you begin to think that maybe Donald Trump really could build a wall along
our southern border for a lot less than our current government estimates.

i

>> ‘The Art of the Deal’ is filled with stories like this — stories of common sense stories of calculated risk
taking, and stories of innovation and marketing.

>> Anyone who would like to better understand Donald Trump would be helped by reading this remarkable
book.

Sy

>> Another is his pledges and I have no way of knowing if he will make good on all of them but I do agree
with all of them. Trump is the only candidate that is serious about building The Wall ! Two other
important pledges Trump has made that no other candidate of either party has matched ! First deportation of
millions of illegals that are demanding and costing American taxpayers billions of dollars and

second Closing 34 Muslim traing Camps throughout our country! I WOULD LIKE TRUMP OR ANY
OTHER CANDIDATES PLEDGE TO REINSTATE ANY AND ALL MILITARY OFFICERS
DISCHARGED BECAUSE THEY DISAGREED WITH OBAMA OR HIS POLICIES!!

>>

>> Here is another that kind of wraps up my feelings about Trump

>> Raccoon's in your basement! An interesting analogy

>> You've been on vacation for two weeks, you come home, and your basement is infested with

raccoon's. Hundreds of rabid, messy, mean raccoon's have overtaken your basement. You want them gone
immediately so you hire a guy. A pro. You don't care if the guy smells, you need those raccoon's gone
pronto and he's the guy to do it! You don't care if the guy swears, you don't care if he's an alcoholic, you
don't care how many times he's been married, you don't care if he voted for Obama, you don't care if he has
plumber's crack...you simply want those raccoon's gone!

>>

>> You want your problem fixed! He's the guy. He's the best. Period. That's why Trump. Yes he's a bit of
an ass, yes he's an egomaniac, but you don't care.

>> The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two-faced & gutless, illegal's are
everywhere. You want it all fixed! You don't care that Trump is crude, you don't care that he insults people,
you don't care that he had been friendly with Hillary, you don't care that he has changed positions, you don't
care that he's been married 3 times, you don't care that he fights with Megyn Kelly and Rosie

O'Donnell, you don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslin terrorist,...this country is weak,
bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegal's, we are becoming a nation of
victims where every Tom, Ricardo and Hamad is a special interest group with special rights

>> to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in; “AND WE JUST
WANT IT FIXED” and Trump is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.

>>

>> You're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic Party, Republican Party, and sick of illegal's. You just
want this thing fixed. Trump may not be a saint, but doesn't have any lobbyist money influencing him, he
doesn't have political correctness restraining him, all you know is that he has been very successful, a good
negotiator, he has built a lot of things, and he's also not a politician, so he's not a cowardly politician. And he
says he'll fix it. You don't care if the guy has bad hair. You just want those raccoon's gone. Out of your
house!

>>

>> This one is more about why we don’t want Hillary.

>> I think this sums it up well !

>> Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a bar. Donald leans over, and with a smile on his face, says,
The media are really tearing you apart for That Scandal.”

>>

>> Hillary: You mean my lying about Benghazi?

>> Trump: No, the other one.”
