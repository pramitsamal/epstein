HOST: As you
mentioned, it's
a long-term
process, not
anything we're
going to see
resolved in the
next few
months or even
years. Though
many people
would say it
would be
easier from the
American
perspective if
the president
wasn't
approaching it
as I go it alone,
a type of

relationship ‘JACK MA: TRADE WAR COULD LAST 20 YEARS \
=

and getting out 9:41 PM CET
of TPP. But
that's for
another
conversation.
Robert, we
appreciate you
joining us.
