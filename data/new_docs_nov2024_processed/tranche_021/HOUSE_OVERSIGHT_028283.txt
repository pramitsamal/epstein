The House of the Nobleman

Posted: 14 October 2010 by Sarah Greenberg, RA Magazine Editor

Most people selling a property try to make it seem welcoming by brewing coffee and - at a stretch — baking bread.
But in a world gone mad for property and art, the stakes have been raised. How about a house that's been
‘staged’ (as they say Stateside) with a built-in art collection, including an eclectic array of work from Picasso to
Grayson Perry, Rodin to Richter, Manet to, predictably, Murakami, the artist who famously emblazoned his
designs on Louis Vuitton bags.

Yes, the £29m budget is a bit steep, but it needn't put you of from booking a tour to see this renovated mansion
in Cornwall Terrace that has been curated by Victoria Golemblovskaya and artist Wolfe Von Lenkiewicz, with the
participation of the Saatchi Collection and Channel 4.

Exhibition open until 20 October, 11am — 6pm, by appointment only
