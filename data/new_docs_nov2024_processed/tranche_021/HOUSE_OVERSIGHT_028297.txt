PRESS CLIPPING (INTERNET)

Rare Picasso works worth over £6m to be sold in October auction alongside Hirst and Warhol

Four pieces by the Cubist painter go on sale next month and could see record prices

Regent's Park in London is set to be the home of four very special artworks by the world renowned Spanish artist
Pablo Picasso.

The works, believed to worth over £6m ($9.3m) will be exhibited as part of a show called The House of the Noble
Man which is running from October 12 to 20 at 2 Cornwall Terrace in Regents park, London.

The works will go on sale alongside an 1875 Cézanne oil on canvas work, during Frieze week.
According to the co-curator of the exhibit, the four Picasso works on offer will include a 1905 drawing entitled
The Family of Saltimbanques, a 1914 Cubist painting titled Nature Morte au Gobelet and the 1969 piece

Buste d'Hommea la Pipe which is currently price at £3m ($4.6).

In addition to this the exhibit will have works by Yves Klein, Gerhard Richter, Egon Schiele and the more familiar
names of Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst.

The Picasso works are believed to have come from anonymous dealers, whilst a selection of pieces has also come
from Charles Saatchi's New Sensations 2010 roster of emerging artists.

However, for many collectors the undoubted focus of the event will be the four works by Picasso.

Picasso's work is arguably some of the most valued and collectible on the market due to his position as a pioneer
and co-creator of the artistic form of Cubism.

There works subverted the traditional notion of painting an object, instead breaking them up and re-assembling
them in a abstract work to create an ambiguous and thought provoking piece of art.
