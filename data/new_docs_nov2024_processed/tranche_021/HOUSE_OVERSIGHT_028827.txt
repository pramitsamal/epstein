Operations
Locations & Facilities

The locations we have shortlisted to host our office space are San Francisco and
Oakland. We have yet to decide on the two locations, however, we are leaning towards
Oakland due to lower running costs and the accessibility of tech resources. We will also
have one office set up in London where we will appoint one salesperson. We currently
have an operating office space in Islamabad and our back-end developers will be
working from this location.

Technology

Our platform acquires data from different social media sites and discussion forums.
Currently, we are supporting Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. We can acquire
unlimited Twitter data which includes historical data for $60,000 per year. For Facebook
and YouTube, we have developed our own crawler that collects data from both
websites. Our platform can also collect data from any discussion forum and news
website.
