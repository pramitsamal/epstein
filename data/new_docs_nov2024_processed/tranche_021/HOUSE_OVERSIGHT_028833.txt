We do not, and will not, compromise on the quality of our work; superior technical
expertise is our top priority. Experts need to be highly paid as per market standards,
and well-trained, in order to put in their best efforts.

The Business Development Team will consist of two members of staff to manage sales
activities, maintaining valuable relationships with existing clients and identifying new
sales leads.

The marketing will be outsourced to a PR/Marketing agency located in San Francisco
which will cost us approximately $15,000 to $20,000 per month. Also, we plan on
participating in industry related events every quarter such as exhibitions and trade
shows.

Data acquisition from Twitter will cost us $60,000 per year. Our office space expense
is for two locations, i.e. Oakland or San Francisco and London.

We don't plan on paying ourselves salaries until after 2 years, and even then, we will
keep them low so we can invest as much as we can back into the business.

Sources of Funds

We have already covered our startup costs. The founder is currently paying the salaries
of programmers and the back-end office of Tranchulas Islamabad is being used to
facilitate the development process. All servers are currently hosted in Germany which is
also funded by the founder. The company has no loans and has no intention of taking
out any loans from banks. We plan to grow through bootstrapping, keeping our salaries
low and reinvesting our profits in the business, rather than taking on any additional
debt.
