| have asked Rory to help find a full time communications guy to stay here for about a year to work with
me. He doesn't have to be an expert, just a good graduate student would do. Some really positive stuff is
also happening now and we need the world to know about them.

World Energy Forum and CGI guys are here. | am meeting Clinton people in a few minutes.

| have some funding now but will ask all friends to help raise more later when things start happening in full
swing. Election is now scheduled to early September.

Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you here in the not too distant future.
Warm regards,
Waheed
