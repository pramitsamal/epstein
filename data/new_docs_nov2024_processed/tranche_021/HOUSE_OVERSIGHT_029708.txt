“rotation” with Yitzhak Shamir, so that
he could be in the government. He
proposed the ideal of “national unity,”
and greatly devalued the democratic
concept of parliamentary opposition.
Former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni
ruined her reputation when she refused to
join Netanyahu in his last government.
While it is quite true that Livni was an
ineffective opposition leader, it is the
very fact of her refusal to join the
administration and “influence it from
within” that has provoked most of the
criticism by Israeli political
commentators. Similar criticism is
currently being leveled at Labor Party
leader Shelly Yachimovich for stating
clearly that she would not join
Netanyahu’s next government, but would
serve as leader of the opposition. There
are certainly many reasons to criticize
Yachimovich, but not her eminently
democratic decision to lead the
parliamentary opposition. Very few of
our political commentators have ever
expressed respect or even understanding
for the concept of opposition. The most
popular political idea in Israel today is
national unity—better still, a National
Unity Government: “We should all rally
round the flag and support our
government in these critical times.” This
position, widely espoused, echoes what
Peres has said repeatedly over the years.
