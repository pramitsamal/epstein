That’s heresy enough for Wiesenfeld. This time, however, the counter-
wave was powerful. J Street, an organization not around in 2003 that
supports Israel but opposes the settlements, issued a statement calling
CUNY’s action “unacceptable.” Former mayor Ed Koch, of
impeccable pro-Israel credentials, weighed in. Within days CUNY
reversed itself and approved Kushner’s degree.

Now Wiesenfeld is under pressure to resign. He should: No
university is well served by a trustee who values taboo over debate
and doubts an entire people’s humanity.

Kushner told me he believes “there is a very significant change
underway.” Americans are realizing there is “a terrible need for a
dose of debate” on Israel and that “silent acquiescence” to those
“whose politics are based substantially on fantasy and theological
wishes” is dangerous.

Criticism of Israel is not betrayal of Israel. The Kushner affair, like
the Judt affair before it, is important in that Israel’s political compass
is guided to some degree by its sense of the American mood. That
mood, beginning in the White House, is of growing impatience.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, will address
Congress this month. He has responded to tumultuous events in the
Middle East with vapid tactical sound bites. The speech to Congress
is his chance to lay out a strategy for two states. I doubt he’ll ever
locate his inner statesman — in which case the world’s irritation and
futile Palestinian unilateralism will harden.

Yitzhak Rabin did not stand on the White House lawn with Yasser
Arafat for a photo-op. The Israeli warrior understood the necessity of
a two-state peace. To get there at last, “It’s essential that we become
more sophisticated and braver in what we’re willing to say and
think,” Kushner said.

Amen to that — and Tony Judt, great man, requiescat in pace.
