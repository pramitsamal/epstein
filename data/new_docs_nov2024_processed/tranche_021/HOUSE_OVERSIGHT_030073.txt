Syria: Too Big to Fail?

Aaron David Miller

MAY 12, 2011 -- If you're a bit confused about U.S. President
Barack Obama's passivity in the face of Syrian President Bashar al-
Assad's brutal repression of domestic opposition, don't be. Syria isn't
Libya. The Assad regime is just too consequential to risk
undermining.

Although the fall of the House of Assad might actually benefit U.S.
interests, the president isn't going to encourage it. For realists in the
White House, Assad's demise carries more risks than opportunities.
Great powers behave inconsistently -- even hypocritically --
depending on their interests. That's not unusual; it's part of the job
description. In fact, in responding to the forces of change and
repression loosed throughout the Arab world, flexibility is more
important than ideological rigidity.

The last thing America needs is a doctrine or ideological template to
govern how it responds to fast-breaking changes in a dozen Arab
countries, all of which are strikingly different in their respective
circumstances.

That the administration's response often seemed like a giant game of
whack-a-mole, with a new problem popping up daily, was inevitable.
And so was the variety of U.S. responses. In Bahrain, where the
United States had established the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's 5th
Fleet, and in Yemen, where counterterrorism is king, interests
trumped values. You didn't hear Obama make any Qaddafi must go-
style speeches directed against Bahrain's ruling Khalifa family or
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
