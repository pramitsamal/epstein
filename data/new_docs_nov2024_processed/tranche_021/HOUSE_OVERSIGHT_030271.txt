have an unrepresentative Parliament writing an unrepresentative
Constitution,” argued Mohamed ElBaradei, the former international
atomic energy czar who is running for president on a reform platform.
“Because the Muslim Brotherhood is ready, they want elections
first,” adds Osama Ghazali Harb, another reform party leader. “We as
secular forces prefer to have some time to consolidate our parties. We
must thank the army for the role it played. But it was our revolution,
not a coup d’état. ... If there are fair elections, the Muslim
Brotherhood will only get 20 percent.”

Free elections are rare in the Arab world, so when they happen,
everybody tries to vote — not only the residents of that country. You
can be sure money will flow in here from Saudi Arabia and Qatar to
support the Muslim Brotherhood.

America, though, cannot publicly intervene in the Egyptian election
debate. It would only undermine the reformers, who have come so
far, so fast, on their own and alienate the Egyptian generals. That
said, though, it is important that senior U.S. officials engage quietly
with the generals and encourage them to take heed of the many
Egyptian voices that are raising legitimate concerns about a
premature runoff.

In short, the Egyptian revolution is not over. It has left the dramatic
street phase and is now in the seemingly boring but utterly vital phase
of deciding who gets to write the rules for the new Egypt. And how
Egypt evolves will impact the whole Arab world. I just hope the
Obama team is paying attention. This is so much more important than
Libya.
