26 May - 1 June 2001 -- The revolution will continue to heave and
surge and rage though various forms of clashes and demonstrations
against conditions of the past and of the present. It will also continue
to swing between the reaffirmation of national unity and the
solidarity of the crescent and the cross and the propensity towards
sectarian strife and its attendant confrontations, clashes, accusations
and conflicting theories as to whether this phenomenon stems from a
long festering infection in Egyptian political culture or to the
remnants of the National Democratic Party and state security
apparatus which, although dissolved and disbanded, are nevertheless
suspected of engineering appalling incidents of violence and
destruction.

institutions of government coalesce and reassert the legitimacy of the
state, thereby delegitimising revolution. Recall how the revolution
cooled following the referendum over the constitutional amendments.
Nevertheless, we also must note that as the spirit of revolution
subsided, the spirit of sectarian strife and other doctrinal discords
began to flare. Simultaneously, the leadership that had played the key
role in igniting the revolution and bringing down the old regime
seems to have faded from the scene or lost some of its glimmer.

the revolution through its initial thrust and its first major victory, they
have since been succeeded by much older people, some well into
their 80s. Mohamed El-Baradei may merit a place among the ranks of
