More importantly, even if the Assad’s regime is overthrown, the opposition is
unlikely to succeed in forming a stable and functional democratic government.
Admittedly, Bashar Assad has made immense mistakes since the beginning of the
war. Human rights have been viciously violated, tens of thousands of people,
including civilians, have been killed. But it appears that there is no better alternative
at the moment than Assad remaining in power. Once the regime is overthrown, the
power vacuum is inevitable. Removing Mr. Assad is just a tiny part of a long and
troublesome process. If history is any guide, overthrowing a dictatorship is just the
very first step. Ouster of Muammar Quaddafi in Libya was supposed to bring
democracy and stability. Instead, the country is more destabilized than ever. Two
years after the revolution, a significant part of Libya remains under the control of
the militias, the armed groups who did not cease power even after the

parliamentary elections and continue to use force against the government.

The situation is even worse in Iraq, where Al-Qaeda has been expanding its power
again. The past four months have been among the bloodiest since 2008, with death
toll reaching 3,000. The Al-Qaeda affiliate, The Islamic State of Iraq, started
conducting terrorist attacks, not only against the government forces and Shia
mosques, but also the civilians, further destabilizing the week government. The
Islamic State of Iraq has become one of the most prominent military groups fighting
in Syria. The terrorist groups are trying to destabilize and debase Syria, which
would give them an opportunity to create there a platform to plan international

terrorist attacks. If the opposition forces gain control of the country, this scenario is
