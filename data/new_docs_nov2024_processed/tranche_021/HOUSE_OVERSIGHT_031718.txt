reforms in the name of “nation building.” Yet the newly-installed
regimes owed their existence to denying freedoms that would rally
dissidents to overthrow them. So the democratization America
encouraged was doomed from the start.

Then came the “abandon.” Time and time again, when the
governments America had nurtured and praised faced resistance or
rebellion, Washington deserted their leaders, citing the popular excuse
that their repressive measures were enslaving their own people.

Supporting leaders when they kept the Middle East stable, then
dumping them when they failed to adopt Western ideals, was a
blueprint for disaster. And it’s disaster that ensued. Many of those
strongmen——from Mubarak in Egypt to Gaddafi in Libya——have
fallen. Once dominated by repressive but stable nation-states, vast
swaths of the Middle East are now borderless, a hodge-podge of
territories controlled by warring factions that’s a throwback to its
tribal past.

The search for a solution to this chaos requires a clear understanding
of how we got here in the first place.

For centuries, the Ottoman Empire had neutralized the historically
rooted sectarian divisions within Islam. Those divisions stem from its
ancient political legacy as a “caliphate,” a religious state with united by
military might, but with constantly shifting borders. Following the
Ottoman collapse after World War I, European colonial powers
assumed the role of regional administrator, and colluded to redraw
boundaries (i.e. Sykes-Picot) in the Middle-East to create nation states
that satisfied competing Western interests. Those newly-created
nations, occupying territories defined by legal borders, ignored Arab
history and tribal custom. Modern Western notions of distinct nations
bound together by geography, language, self-determination or political
ideals been relevant in the Arab world. To Arabs, tribe and religion
