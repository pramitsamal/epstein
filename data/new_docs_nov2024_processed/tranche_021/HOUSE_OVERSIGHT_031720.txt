religion.

Now, nearly four decades old, the Revolutionary Guard’s rise to power
remains the catalyst for Islamic sectarian division today, releasing
forces of fury once confined first by Ottoman rule and then by US
dominance in the region. The threat to Arab nations and the West that
ensued is the same as that led by the Ottomans: the spread of a radical
Islamic caliphate based on religion, not country. In Iran, this is credo

balancing act: limiting nuclear proliferation and, at the same time,
firmly standing against the religious intolerance fanning Islamic
terrorism.

The outbreak of these historically opposing forces, compounded by
declining oil prices, is heightening the ferment.

The Arab World’s best hope is the rise of a new generation in

leaders are crafting forward-looking policies to effectively forge a new
Middle East. American foreign policy must persuade these bold
visionaries to lean West rather than East. This endeavor will not

safeguard America’s interests. By supporting their anti-terrorism
platforms abroad, America enhances its anti-terrorism policies at
