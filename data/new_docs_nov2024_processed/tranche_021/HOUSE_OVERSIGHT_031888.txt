believe in all the right ideas, but their countries aren’t ready for the
vision they seek to promote. They can help make a revolution but
others will, for a time at least, determine the flow of events.

If true, then both the realists and the idealists are wrong about the
Arab Revolution. The realists are wrong that despotic regimes can
provide long term stability in the region; the idealists are wrong that
the fall of the old despots will lead to liberal democratic states.
Americans have been getting foreign revolutions wrong for more than
200 years. It began with the French Revolution. Enthusiasts like
Thomas Jefferson initially thought they saw France following in
America’s footsteps. Then came the Reign of Terror, Napoleon, and
a generation of brutal war.

Many Americans responded with the same generous enthusiasm to
the South American revolutions against colonial rule. Once again,
those revolutions failed to establish anything like liberal democratic
rule.

The cycles of revolution — 1830, 1848, 1917-20, 1946-1960
(decolonization), 1989-91, 2003-5 and now 2011 — catch Americans
flatfooted over and over again. We are surprised when they occur,
and we are surprised when they fail to follow the course we expect.
Delusional Realists

The realists are half right: most revolutions will not bring about
stable democratic societies. But realists get the other half wrong;
revolution is a basic fact of modern life and the kind of ‘stability’ that
old fashioned diplomats long for is just a mirage. American foreign
policy cannot proceed on the assumption that despotic, frozen
regimes will last. They won’t. Sooner or later they will come
crashing down — and as the pace of technological and social change
around the world continues to accelerate, such revolutionary
upheavals are likely to become more frequent.
