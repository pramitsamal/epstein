Interview with - Francis Fukuyama: The
Difficulty of Political Order

Matthew Shaffer

June 13, 2011 -- It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call Francis
Fukuyama one of the most important thinkers in America. He’s a rare
triple threat in public-intellectual life — maintaining high
appointments in academe, producing popular books and magazine
writing consumed by the chattering classes, and advising American
presidents and foreign leaders directly. He combines expertise and
influence with breadth: He’s worked on questions as imperial as
American grand strategy and as delicate and abstract as bioethics.
He’s most famous for The End of History and the Last Man, whose
perennially misunderstood title is often jeered, but which defined a
decade’s thinking about the post-Cold War world order and
globalization. His latest book is Origins of Political Order, which
traces a single story through several millennia and dozens of different
cultures, empires, and societies — the story of how man emerged
from tribal structures into a modern state. Fukuyama talks with
NRO’s Matthew Shaffer, about the book and how his thinking about
world order and America’s place in it has changed over the last 20
years.

MATTHEW SHAFFER: Origins is a historical work, as opposed to
previous works, such as The End of History, and Our Posthuman
Future, which were more theoretical. What, for you, is the
prescriptive value of history?
