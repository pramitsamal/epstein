But the idea of liberal democracy — the U.S. is not the only exemplar
of liberal democracy — [remains]. It’s a powerful idea that would
exist independently of whether the U.S. is hegemonic or not.

I’m not as scared of a world without American hegemony as some
people are. We went through the whole Cold War period in which the
U.S. was one of two superpowers. A return to a more multi-polar
world in certain ways induces a fair amount of moderation among big
players in the system, because people know they can’t get their way
unilaterally. And in the more multi-polar world we’d probably think
twice about doing things like Iraq. The more important question is: In
the global marketplace of ideas, how dominant will American ideas
about freedom and rule of law and democracy and our economic
model be? Our ideas will obviously be challenged; and it’s important
for the U.S. to put its own house in order, both politically and
economically, because that’s the most important way we exercise
influence around the world: The model we set.

SHAFFER: To revisit Our Posthuman Future, are there any
developments in bio-technologies in the past nine years that you find
particularly disturbing?

FUKUYAMA: Yes. The whole rise of synthetic biology, where

we ve had new forms of life, and the ability to do new forms of life is
proceeding extremely rapidly. The creation of an artificial bacteria
itself is not immediately threatening, but it’s part of a long-term
process by which we’ll uncover the technologies for manufacturing
life, in ways that could have very serious security and moral
implications.
