Israeli-Arab Crisis Approaching

August 22, 2011 -- In September, the U.N. General Assembly will
vote on whether to recognize Palestine as an independent and
sovereign state with full rights in the United Nations. In many ways,
this would appear to be a reasonable and logical step. Whatever the
Palestinians once were, they are clearly a nation in the simplest and
most important sense - namely, they think of themselves as a nation.
Nations are created by historical circumstances, and those
circumstances have given rise to a Palestinian nation. Under the
principle of the United Nations and the theory of the right to national
self-determination, which is the moral foundation of the modern
theory of nationalism, a nation has a right to a state, and that state has
a place in the family of nations. In this sense, the U.N. vote will be
unexceptional.

However, when the United Nations votes on Palestinian statehood, it
will intersect with other realities and other historical processes. First,
it is one thing to declare a Palestinian state; it is quite another thing to
create one. The Palestinians are deeply divided between two views of
what the Palestinian nation ought to be, a division not easily
overcome. Second, this vote will come at a time when two of Israel's
neighbors are coping with their own internal issues. Syria is in chaos,
with an extended and significant resistance against the regime having
emerged. Meanwhile, Egypt is struggling with internal tension over
the fall of President Hosni Mubarak and the future of the military
junta that replaced him. Add to this the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq
and the potential rise of Iranian power, and the potential recognition
of a Palestinian state - while perfectly logical in an abstract sense -
