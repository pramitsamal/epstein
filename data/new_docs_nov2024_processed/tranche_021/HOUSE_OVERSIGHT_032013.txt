Did the British promise the Arabs independence in

Palestine?

In July 1915, Hussein ibn ‘Ali, the Sherif of
Mecca, sent a letter to Sir Henry MacMahon,
the High Commissioner for Egypt, informing
him of the terms for Arab participation in the
war against the Turks. The letters between
Hussein and Mac-Mahon that followed outlined
the areas that Britain was prepared to cede to
the Arabs in exchange for their help.
