HOST: If not dissent at least a little difference in opinion
when those who don’t agree with him basically, because he’s
in the constitution, are against the communist party. They
can leave or they can put up with it, no middle ground or
perhaps question?

RLK: This is a very interesting point and it goes to the party
concept of what they call democratic centralism and
collective leadership. When Xi was appointed Core about a
year ago, which was a very significant move, the party also
said it was reaffirming collective leadership. Now that
seems on its surface an oxymoron, contradictory, but in the
Chinese system it was not, and it’s good to understand why.

RLK: Xi has overarching decision making power which he
didn’t have before he was made ‘core’. But he is obligated
under the system to respect the system - ifhe continues to
do so, and I certainly expect he will - to really listen to all of
the opinions of the senior leaders, certainly the people in
the standing committee. And to conduct substantial
research, reviews with experts, and polling and iterative

kinds of research that they do for all their major documents.

So he is obligated to do such serious consultation under the
party system. Now can he subvert it the way Mao did? |
don’t think that’s really possible even if he tried and I don’t
think he will do that. So it’s a combination of him now
having the absolute power, no question about it, but still
respecting party norms of how they go about the research
and decision-making process.
