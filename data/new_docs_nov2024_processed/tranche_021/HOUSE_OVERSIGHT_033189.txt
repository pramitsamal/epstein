Dear Packer Families,

Like many of you, I am writing this message on very little sleep. Last night was like no other in our
political memory, defying the predictions of the most erudite pundits and political
prognosticators.

Today, we are spending a great deal of time unpacking the election results with our students
across the three divisions — during morning meeting and throughout the day in Lower School
classrooms, in Middle School advisories, during Upper School Community time, as well as in
many individual classroom conversations. I write to assure you that we will do our best to handle
these discussions with balance, sensitivity, and fairness.

Given that last week's mock election among Packer’s Upper School students showed that over
80% favored Secretary Clinton, I don’t think it’s a huge leap to assume that there was more
disappointment than joy in Packer households as results unfolded last night. At the same time,
there are certainly Packer families who support Mr. Trump and are pleased with this outcome. As
a school community, we have an obligation to recognize that there will be a broad array of feelings
generated by the election results, and it is our responsibility as a school to make space for these
feelings to be expressed thoughtfully and compassionately, as well as to model the tolerance and
acceptance of difference that are among our core values. No doubt, we have our work cut out for
us, but Iam confident in the good that we can do as a community.
