e He (Epstein) had gone to jail in Florida for soliciting prostitution for no reason;

e Ifthe same thing (i.e., sexual abuse of minor girls) had happened in New York, he
(Epstein) would have received only a $200 fine;

e Bradley J. Edwards was the one causing all of Epstein’s problems (i.e., the civil
suits brought by Jane Doe and other girls);

e L.M. came to him as a prostitute and a drug user (1.e., came to Epstein for sex,
rather than Epstein pursuing her);

¢ All the girls suing him are only trying to get a meal ticket;

e The only thing he might have done wrong was to maybe cross the line a little too
closely;

e He (Epstein) was very upset that Edwards had subpoenaed Ghisline Maxwell, that
she was a good person that did nothing wrong (i.¢e., had done nothing wrong even
though she helped procure young girls to satisfy Epstein’s sexual desires);

e With regard to Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein, which involved an allegation that Epstein
had repeatedly sexually abused a 15-year-old girl, forced her to have sex with his
friends, and flew her on his private plane nationally and internationally for the
purposes of sexually molesting and abusing her, he (Epstein) flippantly said that
the case was dismissed, indicating that the allegations were ridiculous and untrue.

See Affidavit of Michael J. Fisten attached hereto as Exhibit “QQ.”

81. The Rush interview also demonstrated perjury (a federal crime) on the part of
Epstein. Epstein lied about not knowing George Rush. See Epstein Deposition, February 17,
2010, taken in L.M. v. Jeffrey Epstein, case 50-2008-CA-028051, page 154, line 4 through 155
line 9, (Deposition -attachment #7), wherein Jeffrey Epstein clearly impresses that he does not
recognize George Rush from the New York Daily News. This impression was given despite the

fact that he gave a lengthy personal interview about details of the case that was tape recorded

with George Rush.
