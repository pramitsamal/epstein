people who would have relevant information in the civil
cases, but when asked in deposition about
Mr. Dershowitz, he took the Fifth.

So I -- I found it significant that for some
people, he was willing to answer questions, but with
regard to Mr. Dershowitz, he took his -- he invoked his
Fifth Amendment right against compelled
self-incrimination presumably because revealing what he
knew about Mr. Dershowitz would, you know, cause
criminal -- criminal charges potentially to be filed
against him.

There was a common scheme or plan, and I'll
elaborate on that in a moment, but yeah, one of -- so
this was another point, I mentioned that -- that there
had been three efforts to get information from
Mr. Dershowitz by way of a 2009 deposition request, a
2011 deposition request, and further follow-up

correspondence from counsel on that, and a 2013 document

request all propounded to Mr, Dershowitz that had not
gone answered.

Yeah, and this was -- yeah, I'm sorry, this
slipped my mind at the time -- but when -- when we saw
Mr. Dershowitz not responding to these answers, you
know, maybe the mail didn't get delivered to him or
something like that. I don't -- I suppose that's, you

know, a theoretical possibility.

But -- but the reason I ruled out that
possibility, first, it didn't seem likely; but secondly,
there was a pattern of Mr. Epstein's associates evading
efforts to get information from them.

And so let me just go back to the earliest
instance of that. According to the Chief of Police in
the Palm Beach -- of the Palm Beach Police Department,
Mr. Dershowitz had said that he would make available
Mr. Epstein for questions about the ~- the sex, you
know, abuse that was going on. And, you know,

Mr, Dershowitz had said to the Palm Beach Police
Department, yeah, we will make him available; no, we got
to reschedule it; you know, and then another time,
reschedule, another time. And so there were multiple --
according to the Chief of Police, there had been

multiple, you know, requests to interview Mr. Epstein

and Mr. Dershowitz had repeatedly said: Oh, yeah, we
will schedule that, and then it hadn't happened.

Now, obviously, there could have been a
situation there where, you know, an emergency had come
up for Mr. Epstein and he wasn't able to make a schedule
or something like that. But what I saw was a -~ was a
pattern of offers to -- to meet and then withdrawals,
and that seemed to me to be a deliberately calculated

o21e00 1 strategy to sort of stall the investigation to say:

aie03 2 Well, we will get you Epstein; oh, we can't meet now;
02:18:03 3 oh, we will get it now -- and then -- and so forth.

ozte04 | 4 And one of the things that I noted from all
oztecs «5 ~©6that was that Mr. Dershowitz, as Mr. Epstein's attorney,
ozis02 «6 never ultimately produced Epstein for a meeting with the
oz1e14 7 Palm Beach Police Department, having made another offer.
oni = 8 Now, obviously, something could have happened
owis 9 there, I mean, I don't -- you know, I don't know what
021821 10 was the communications and so forth, but as an attorney
021824 11 trying to get information and unable to do that, I had
021822 12 to make some reasonable inferences.

o21820 13 And so one of the inferences I began to draw
21631 14 was that this was a stall tactic by Mr. Dershowitz, and
o218:34 15 in my view, potentially, an unethical one, but I

021837 16 don't -- I don't think we need to get into that in this

o2is3e 17 ~~ litigation.

oztazo 18 What I saw was a stall tactic going on,
02184419 and -- and the reason I think it was a stall tactic, as

o2146 20 we are sitting here now in, what is it, October of 2015,
e151 21 and Mr. Epstein has never been willing to answer

021884 22 questions about his sexual abuse of these girls.

oz1ess 23 And this was back in around -- what was it?
021901 24 I quess it would be 2005, 2006, you know, roughly a
oz1906 25 decade ago, Mr. Dershowitz was offering to make Epstein

oz1007 1 available. And then that never happened, and given the
o2te11 2 ten-year pattern that -- that developed -- I guess I

21912 3 should go back. I'm sorry. Let me correct my answer.
oz 4 We should go back to December 30th, 2014. So
ota7 § there -- there appeared to be about an eight-year period
021921 § of time during which Mr. Epstein had refused to answer
o2z1924 Y any questions about his sexual abuse of girls and yet,
o21322 8 Mr. Dershowitz said, oh, it’s just a scheduling issue

021930 9 and -- and we will get the Palm Beach Police Department
oz1933 10 to -- to, you know, to meet and ~- and learn all this.

oztsa7 14 The other thing that I'm -- that I'm seeing
o21¢30 12 here, so now there's -- there's -- Mr. Dershowitz had
021942 13 been involved in concealing Mr. Epstein from the Palm
oz1e46 14 Beach Police Department, but there were others that had
o2te47 18 done similar sorts of things.

ozra40 16 So one of them was a Ghislaine Maxwell. I
oz1955 17 will just call her Glenn Maxwell. I think that's kind

o2z955 18 of the nickname I understand she goes by.

oztese 19 So Glenn Maxwell -- remember, she is -- she
21959 20 is the one, you know, I think the record is clear, in ~~
e200 21 in--in litigation that, you know, an allegation has

22006 22 been made that she was the one that -- that brought
o22008 23 Virginia Roberts into the -- into the sex trafficking,

o22012 24 and was heavily involved with -- you know, on all the --
o22015 25 not all the flights, but on many of the flights with
