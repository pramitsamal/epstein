Marshall’s pupil Keynes was thoroughly a marginalist, as are economists in general
today and as am I. One of the features of his General Theory of 1936 was a kind of
double-entry accounting for national product. Product was output and equivalently
income. Output meant the sum of prices of final products produced within the year,
while income meant the shares of that sum paid to the workers and investors

producing it. His double-entry idea can be put as

output = investment + consumption = income = pay + profit. (6.19)

I showed why | disagree. But let us see how the total return truism might seem to

have led to that inference if we leave workers or human capital outside the economy.

To treat them as arriving exogenously from outside is essentially to treat the
national economy as if it were a single firm. Output inside is simply profit. Output

outside is work, meaning creation of value by the workers. This gives the truism
output = work + profit,

confirming that total output is the sum of factor outputs.

So far, so good. But now Mill and Keynes and most tradition slip by arguing that pay

equals and compensates all of work and nothing else. That’s why (6.18) equates

output to pay plus profit. Schultz and Ben-Porath and other students of human

capital correct this in part by recognizing some work as self-invested rather than

marketed for pay. My pay rule adds that pay recovers human depreciation as well as

realized work. (6.19) should have reasoned

output = income = work + profit

= pay + self-invested work - human depreciation + profit. (6.20)
