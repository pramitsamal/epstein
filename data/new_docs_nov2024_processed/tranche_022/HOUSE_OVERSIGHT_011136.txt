(A3.6) combines with (A1.4) and (A1.5) to arrive at

7, =F =Y,gross—p,, (A3.7)

at the scale of the total capital of the individual or any set of individuals. This fact

will prove helpful in adjusting the Ben-Porath model and in next generation theory.

It should be borne in mind that transfer out and transfer in are both implicitly
defined as net of plowback in the first place. Thus it would be wrong to suppose that
negative cash flow is transfer in less plowback from revenue. That mistake would

deduct plowback twice.

The Growth Truism

Growth of any asset of either factor is capitalization from outside plus capitalization

from inside less decapitalization. This difference can also be called net capitalization.

Capitalization from outside is simply transfer in t_ . What are the other two?

Our first intuition would be that capitalization from inside is identical to unrealized
output. Here we must be careful. Output is negative wherever the sum of growth
(net capitalization) and cash flow falls below zero. This “deadweight loss” is
implicitly uncovered decapitalization, meaning not recovered in cash flow. To
subtract all including unrecovered decapitalization from the sum of transfer in and

unrealized output would therefore subtract the unrecovered part twice.

To make this clear, define positive and negative output by
Y(>0)=max(Y,0) and Y(<0)=max(-Y,0)=2,
