into consideration whether she could have sued six people for
it, 20 other people for it, this case is about Maxwell and her
defamation against my client.

So again, your Honor, if you look at Sack on
Defamation, it addresses that directly, and we believe that
that should not come into evidence.

So your Honor, that's the first chunk of the omnibus

motion that I was addressing. I'm not sure how you want to

take it, if you want to have opposing counsel speak on those
issues now and then move to the others, or if you want us to
keep moving through it?

COURT: What's your preference?

MS. McCAWLEY: I think keep moving through it would be

great.

THE COURT: What?

Gl

MS. McCAWLEY: To keep moving it through it, if that's

all right, so we can get through argument and then have them
address it?

THE, COURT: Sure.

MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you, your Honor.

MS. SCHULTZ: Your Honor, this is Meredith Schultz for
the plaintiff. The next article in the omnibus motion is to
exclude testimony references to prior sexual assault. This is
an issue that I spoke on yesterday related to another motion

regarding the same, so I'll keep it brief.
