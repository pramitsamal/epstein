that Fox has placed models with Plaintiff MC2 in the past with absolutely no problems.
However, because of the false internet trafficking links between Plaintiffs and Epstein, Fox states
that it cannot place anymore models with Plaintiff MC2 until the allegations are cleared up.

18. Before the false links between Plaintiff and Epstein surfaced, Plaintiff Brunel was
earning a great deal of revenue from MC2 Miami.

19. The false links between Plaintiffs and Epstein began to surface online in about 2005-
2006. Then, in 2006, Plaintiffs received a letter of credit from Epstein at 5% interest. Plaintiffs
then made an investment totaling one-million dollars with Elite Paris, to start a company.

20. Next, Plaintiff Brunel started the company, “E Management”, to work with Elite Models
in Paris, Plaintiff had to close it almost immediately, because Elite didn’t send any models to
Plaintiff MC2 for fear of being linked to Epstein.

21. Because the false links between Plaintiffs and Epstein began to gain strength online, Elite
Paris severed the agreement due entirely to these false links. Plaintiff Brunel lost his investment
of one-million dollars because of this loss of business.

22. Plaintiffs lost potentially ten-million dollars in profits due to this initial one-million dollar
loss.

23. Additionally, a former financial controller of MC2, Maritza Vasquez, stated in a 2012
deposition that Plaintiff Brunel had never done anything inappropriate or illegal with any under-
age model. (Exhibits H! & H2 -Transcript of Deposition of Maritza Vasquez).

24. Maritza Vasquez was fired from her job at Plaintiff MC2 for embezzling company funds,
and had criminal charges filed against her (Composite Exhibit I attached). She was also the
source of the false information linking Plaintiffs to sex trafficking in the articles written by

Conchita Sarnoff of the website Jezebel (Composite Exhibit A, p.2-7).
