RE: O-1 Non-immigrant Visa Petition on behalf of Jean Luc Brunel
Dear Sir or Madam:

It in. an extreme pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for Mr. Jean
Lac Brunel. I provide this recommendation based on my knowledgr and
experience in the field of modeling, due to my established reputation and
work in the field as the Vladimir Yudashkin, director of 1 Mother Agency.
Kiev, Ukraine

I have known Jean Luc Brunel professionally for several, yeare through
our work together and, an my opinion, he is an extremely talented
individual with superb professional reputation. He is anjiextraordinarily
able coordinator who atrives for and attains a level of merit in his work
that only a few of hia contemporaries meet. He has the ability to
recognize the creative vision of his client within the tinic and budget
through hig careful and thoughtful choice of model casting combined
with his meticulous ability in the field. Jean Luc Brunel ib a true find in
our industry.

There are plenty of art directors out there. but none with the depth end
quality that Mr. Brunei possesses. He is unlike anyonc in this industry,
and I expect to see him continue to find great models in hie successful
career. Someone overflowing with talent as Jean Luc Brunel should be
given every opportunity to work in the United States, where he will have
the proper venues (c showcase his extraordinary talents.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should veu have any queations
regarding this matter. you fer vuur time and consideration.
