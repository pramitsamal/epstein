KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP
* The defense immediately raised concerns regarding the non-independence
of the review when told that it would be Mr. Oosterbaan tasked with
providing the review, but was told that when Mr. Oosterbaan rendered his
prior opinion, “he was not really up to speed on the facts”

o CEOS’ review was not de novo:

 By letter dated May 15, 2008 (four days before Mr. Sloman’s letter), Mr.
Oosterbaan advised Mr. Lefkowitz that CEOS reviewed the matter only
for abuse of discretion:

[T]he question we sought to answer was whether U.S.
Attorney Acosta would abuse his discretion if he
authorized prosecution in this case.

See Tab 38, May 15, 2008 Letter from D. Oosterbaan, p. 1 (emphasis
added). See also, id. p. 2 (“Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his
discretion if he decided to pursue such a course of action.”); and p. 5
(“Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he
authorized federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein.”).

«For the factual record of its “abuse of discretion” review, CEOS relied on
the very same prosecution memo that it had already reviewed in rendering
its prior opinion, stating:

As you know, our review of this case is limited, both factually and
legally. We have not looked at the entire universe of facts in this
case.

See Id., p. 1 (emphasis added).

«Nor did CEOS review any facts related to the irregular provisions in the

Deferred Prosecution Agreement or the numerous complaints of

prosecutorial misconduct, both of which are inextricably intertwined with

the impropriety of the investigation. Jd. at 1.

Mr. Sloman’s Letter:

e Mr. Sloman dismissed the totality of the defense’s objections to the inappropriate
notification the SDFL proposed to send to its witnesses, stating merely that:

“[Y Jou objected to victims[”] being notified of time and place of Epstein’s
state[-]court sentencing hearing.”
