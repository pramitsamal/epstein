The new Dream Downtown has the best of both worlds. Housed in a Now Live
1960s building designed by Albert C. Ledner, it's situated at the crux of
Manhattan's art, design and nightlife scenes between Chelsea and the
Meatpacking District. With a hot rooftop bar, a Miami-meets-Ibiza pool
(with lounge chairs set in real sand) and modern rooms with classic
Downtown views, you can have your party and a good night's sleep, too.
