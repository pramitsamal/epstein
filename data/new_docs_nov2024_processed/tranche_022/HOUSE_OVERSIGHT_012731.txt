In a beautifully renovated redbrick-and-stone former bank building, the Now Live
Omni San Francisco has an elegant ambiance and draws inspiration
from Renaissance Florence. The spacious rooms have carved-
mahogany furniture and nine-foot-high crown molded ceilings, while
sparkling crystal chandeliers, mahogany paneling and an iron-and-
marble staircase define the lobby. Best of all, it's within walking distance
from some of the city's top attractions like Union Square, North Beach
and Chinatown.
