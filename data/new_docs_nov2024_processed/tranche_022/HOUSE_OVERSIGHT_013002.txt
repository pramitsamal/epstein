86 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures

The LIDA cognitive cycle itself is a theoretical construct that can be implemented in many
ways, and indeed other BICAs like CogPrime and Psi also manifest the LIDA cognitive cycle
in their dynamics, though utilizing different particular structures to do so.

Figure 4.13 shows the cycle pictorially, starting in the upper left corner and proceeding
clockwise. At the start of a cycle, the LIDA agent perceives its current situation and allocates
attention differentially to various parts of it. It then broadcasts information about the most
important parts (which constitute the agent’s consciousness), and this information gets features
extracted from it, when then get passed along to episodic and semantic memory, that interact
in the “global workspace” to create a model for the agent’s current situation. This model then,
in interaction with procedural memory, enables the agent to choose an appropriate action and
execute it - the critical “action-selection” phase!

The LIDA Cognitive Cycle in More Depth

We now run through the cognitive cycle in more detail. It begins with sensory stimuli from
the agent’s external internal environment. Low-level feature detectors in sensory memory begin
the process of making sense of the incoming stimuli. These low-level features are passed to
perceptual memory where higher-level features, objects, categories, relations, actions, situations,
