that interact with each other in a synergetic way [Goe09c], helping each other to overcome
their intrinsic combinatorial explosions. There is significant evidence that these various types
of long-term memory are differently implemented in the brain, but the degree of structure and
dynamical commonality underlying these different implementations remains unclear.
