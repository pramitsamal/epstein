15.3.3 Dual Networks

Finally, if both hierarchical and heterarchical structures exist in an Atomspace, then both ECAN
and PLN will naturally blend them together, because hierarchical and heterarchical links will
feed into their link-creation processes and naturally be combined together to form new links.
This will tend to produce a structure called a dual network, in which a hierarchy exists, along
with a rich network of heterarchical links joining nodes in the hierarchy, with a particular density
of links between nodes on the same hierarchical level. The dual network structure will emerge
without any explicit engineering oriented toward it, simply via the existence of hierarchical
and heterarchical networks, and the propensity of ECAN and PLN to be guided by both the
hierarchical and heterarchical networks. The existence of a natural dual network structure in
both linguistic and sensorimotor data will help the formation process along, and then creative
cognition will enrich the dual network yet further than is directly necessitated by the external
world.
