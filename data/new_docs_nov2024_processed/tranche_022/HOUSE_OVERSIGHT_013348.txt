Talented Mr. Epstein, By Vicky Ward on January, 2005 in Published Work, Vanity Fair (See
article attached as Exhibit “OO”); (c) Epstein’s housekeeper Alfredo Rodriguez testified that
Dershowitz stayed at Epstein’s house during the years when Epstein was assaulting minor
fornafes on a daily basis; (d) Rodriguez testified that Dershowitz was at Epstein’s house at times
shen underage females where there being molested by Epstein (see Alfredo Rodriguez
deposition at 278-280, 385, 426-427); (e) Dershowitz reportedly assisted in attempting to
persuade the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office that because the underage females alleged to
have been victims of Epstein’s abuse lacked credibility and could not be believed that they were
at Epstein’s house, when Dershowitz himself was an eyewitness to their presence at the house;
(f) J ane Doe No. 102 stated generally that Epstein forced her to be sexually exploited by not only
Epstein but also Epstein’s “adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians,
businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances” — categories that Dershowitz
and acquaintances of Dershowitz fall into; (g) during the years 2002-2005 Alan Dershowitz was
on Bpstein’s plane on several occasions according to the flight logs produced by Epstein’s pilot
and information (described above) suggested that sexual assaults may have taken place on the
plane; (h) Epstein donated $30 Million one year to the university at which Dershowitz teaches.
Balad on this information, Edwards had a reasonable basis to believe that Dershowitz might
hese relevant information to provide in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and accordingly
provided notice of a possible deposition. See Dershowitz letters to the State Attorney's office
attached .as Exhibit “PP”; Deposition of Alfredo Rodriguez at 278-280; Flight Logs Exhibit

“MM”; Exhibits “B” and “OO”; and Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at 14.
