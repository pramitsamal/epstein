present evidence rebutting the motion for summary judgment and there is no genuine issue of
material fact, then entry of judgment is proper as a matter of law. See Davis v. Hathaway, 408

, B. Epstein’s Claim Regarding Edwards Have Absolutely No Factual Basis.
This is not a complicated case for granting summary judgment. To the contrary, this is a
simple case for summary judgment because each and every one of Epstein’s claim against

Edwards lacks any merit whatsoever.!:

1, Epstein’s allegations regarding Edwards’ involvement in Rothstein’s “Ponzi
Scheme” are unsupported and unsupportable because he was simply not
involved in any such scheme.

a. Edwards Had No Involvement in the Ponzi Scheme.

The bulk of Epstein’s claims against Edwards hinge on the premise that Edwards was
involved in a Ponzi scheme run by Scott Rothstein. Broad allegations of wrongdoing on the part

any substance as to how Edwards actually assisted the Ponzi scheme, and allegations that he
“knew or should have known” of its existence are based upon an impermissible pyramiding of
inferences. In any event, these allegations all fail for one straightforward reason: Edwards was
simply not involved in any Ponzi scheme. He has provided sworn testimony and an affidavit in
support of that assertion, and there is not (and could never be) any contrary evidence.
