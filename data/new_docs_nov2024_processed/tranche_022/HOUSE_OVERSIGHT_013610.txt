Complexity is a more general and variously defined descriptive expression
than that of the topological and metric entropies and as such brings with it many
kinds of definitions and computational approaches. One choice that’s intuitively
appealing assumes that the relative complexity of an expression representing, say
an outcome of an observation or experiment, is reflected in the minimum length of
the most compressed program (algorithm) from which, given a suitable dictionary of
symbolic equivalencies, one can reconstitute the original expression. Increases in
what some have called algorithmic complexity, AC, are reflected in the growth of
this minimally descriptive symbol series length. Karen Selz’s approach to
compression and AC, similar to one proposed by Paul Rapp, involves the
identification and symbolic representation of repeated blocks of symbols called
words. For example, given an_ arbitrary, exemplifying binary — series:
011011101010001010101001001010011, we first find the longest repeated word
[1010100] and represent it with the symbol, a, yielding a shortening in the original
series, 011011a010a1010011. The next longest repeated word is [011] is replaced
with b, yielding a further compression, 66a010a1010b. The next remaining binary
word is of length equal to the previous one, [010], which, when replaced by c results
in the series bbacat1cb. This can be further compressed to the final representation
with four symbols and for the sequentially repeated b, one exponent of degree two,
b*aca1cb. From this representation and a dictionary of letter equivalent words, the
original binary expression can be recovered. For a quantitative index of the
algorithmic complexity, AC, of the compression, Selz computes the sum of the
number of distinct symbols plus the sum of the natural logarithms of the exponents:
4 + log (2) = 4.6931. The binary representation of 729, 1011011001, discussed
above, is compressed by making two [101]’s = a and two 0’s = b resulting in a71b*1.
Having three distinct symbols, a,o, and 1, and two exponents of two, its algorithmic

complexity is equal to, AC = 3 + 2 x log(2) = 4.38.
