State of the Multifamily Market: Cooling or Collapsing?

We hosted a panel to discuss the state and the outlook for the multifamily market
following a year which has witnessed increased investor anxiety around multifamily loan
growth and heightened scrutiny by banking regulators of multifamily loan portfolios,
particularly at banks with a high concentration of multifamily loans. Our panelists
included John Jardine, Co-CEO of Ares Commercial Real Estate Corp, David
Brickman, Executive Vice President and the Head of Multifamily business at
Freddie Mac and Alan Fishman, Chairman of the Board at commercial real estate
investment trust Ladder Capital.

= Multifamily on solid footing: The panelists view the multifamily market as having
a solid foundation with most of the risk lying at the high end, class A properties in
particular markets (New York, San Francisco). Even here, the panelists agreed that
the issues at the high end segment were more likely to manifest themselves in the
form of decelerating growth in rents (and increased incentives by landlords) as
opposed to serious credit issues. Investors echoed this sentiment during a live
audience poll with 60% of the investors seeing issues in the multifamily market
limited to certain regions and at certain rental price points.
