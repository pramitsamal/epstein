Higher yields leading to bank, insurance outperformance
over REITs

The Japanese equity market correction managed to last just for one day after the US
election. The insurance sector has been the best performer since the US election on the
back of a steeper US Treasury curve and higher rates. Michael Hartnett observes
“violent rotation out of deflation to inflation plays”, including a move from REITs to US
banks. This should apply to Japan, where banks and insurance have underperformed
REITs amid relentless fall of the long-term yield and introduction of negative interest
rate by the Bo) (Chart 5). The domestic policy condition has changed, however, as the
Bo) is now reluctant to cut rate as it pays greater attention to the health of the financial
institution. The Bo) now intends to prevent the yield curve from flattening excessively.
While higher foreign yields may not lift yen rates as the Bo) controls the 10-year sector,
reflationary environment outside Japan at least reduces the risk of a deeper cut at home.
Outperformance of Japanese equities at the time of UST bear steepening has
historically been led by cyclicals, banks and insurance (Exhibit 2). David Gleeson is
cautious about REITs, while Futoshi Sasaki is constructive on banks. The move can
stretch further near-term.

insurance tend to outperform at the time of UST bear-steepening

Used Bloomberg Treasury yield index.

Curve movements defined based on 2yr move (up or down) and 2510s move (up or down) so these include twist movements, but even if we exclude these, implications for USDJPY and Japan equity do not change
significantly.

11 quarters of bear steepening = average 16bps increase in 2yr yields and 33bps 2510s steepening; 10 quarters of bear flattening = average 26bps increase in 2yr yields and 20bps 2s10s flattening; 10 quarters of bull
steepening = average 48bps decline in 2yr yields and 28bps 2510s steepening; 12 quarters of bull flattening = average 27bps decline in 2yr yields and 30bps 2s 10s flattening
