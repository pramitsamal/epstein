Themes
Long Cyclicality

« Long Asia EM - recovering growth, earnings revisions and cheap valuation.
¢ Long Nikkei — growth picking up, JPY soft, 20k target.

Bane Yield

Long European dividend yield stocks — 5% yield, big pick up over IG credit.
« Long Dec 18 SX5E dividend future — implies 4% drop from 2016, we see 4% rise.
« Long basket of AT1s — high yield, equity cushion to rise.

« Long XOver short Main — investors’ reach for yield to push them towards Crossover.

¢ Long basket of 30Y US industrial IG spreads — further spread compression.

MEGEe the Fed/Trump
2-5-10 fly — 5Y part of the curve looks most vulnerable to Fed hiking.

¢ Short 10Y real yields — inflation breakevens have adjusted real rates have not.

« Long USD - long via USD/GBP and USD/AUD, we think policy divergence will drive
USD stronger if the Fed tightens as our economists expect.

¢ Long USD/CNH 7.6 6 month call — hedge against trade tensions

Hedge the Rest

e Weare long SX5E, NKY and RTY vs SPX variance. Carry positive, convex in a sell-off.

« Long Dec 17/18 SX5E put spread. Long 3000-2850 Dec 16 put spread.

Alpha Trades
Long European Pharma. Sector discounting no pipeline, valuation back to cheapest
since 2011. Solid yield too.

¢ Paying 5y UK real rates at -254bp. Implied inflation/rates inconsistent.

¢ Long RUB/ZAR (positive on oil, cautious on S African politics).

¢ Short EUR/SEK, strong Swedish growth, limiting room for Riksbank easing.
