recent price action for individual assets. However, the fact that we have had multiple
signals across a range of sectors and macro prices is typically a warning that markets
have moved too far too fast in a more general sense.

The last comparable episode was in early July in the wake of the Brexit sell-off. At that
point Defensives were hitting record over bought signals with Financials and Cyclicals
seeing the opposite. Against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty over the effects of
Brexit the models provided a great signal to fade the violent rotation.

With these signals in mind we look for a period of consolidation in the rotation trade.
The models are short term in nature and are not intended to identify strategic turning
points — although like in the case of Brexit they do tend to emphasize when a crescendo
is reached. While we would look for another potential leg in some of the reflation trades
over the coming months we would prefer to wait for a pull back. The Basic Resources
sector provides a useful example in how to use the models tactically. Three times this
year prior to the current instance the sector has hit overbought levels on its relative CT|
indicator. Previous pullbacks lasted 4-8 weeks and averaged -11% in relative
performance terms.
