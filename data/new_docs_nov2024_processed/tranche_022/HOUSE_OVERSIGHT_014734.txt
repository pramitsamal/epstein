true against the JPY given the Bank of Japan is pegging 10y JGB yields at zero. We are
cognizant of the possibility that the willingness of Japanese investors — who have
already bought record amount of US bonds this year — to buy more is likely to be
constrained by their recent losses (Chart 7). However, with long-dated USD/JPY forward
outrights near their lowest levels in more than a year, further purchases are more likely
to be currency unhedged (Chart 8). This is why we would recommend buying USD/JPY

even after the big rally of the past week.

More generally, the USD is likely to benefit from repatriation of overseas US corporate
earnings, which is highly likely, in our view, given that it is the lowest hanging fruit in

Washington for the new administration.

4. MXN is oversold but BRL faces more headwinds

Until the US election, EM fixed income was the best performing asset class in 2016,
benefiting from the decline in rates in core markets as well as the rebound in global
growth. The combination of higher US rates and higher USD over the past week has
nearly wiped out its YTD gains. However, long positions remain crowded (Chart 9) and
liquidity conditions are poor. For these reasons, we think downside risk remains and
would recommend selling a basket of Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian long bonds.

Some EM markets have already seen brutal capitulation. In particular, MXN has priced in
alot of bad news, even though it is not clear that the net impact of Trump policy is
negative for Mexico. In contrast, the BRL remains one of the most crowded EM
