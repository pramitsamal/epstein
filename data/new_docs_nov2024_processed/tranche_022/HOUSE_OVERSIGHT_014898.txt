For core margins, we assume y/y contraction through 3Q17, after which we model a
slight uptick in 4Q17. For the year, we assume core Google margins contract 50bps to
46.1%. In terms of blended Alphabet non-GAAP operating margins, we assume 7Obps of
y/y contraction to 40.7% in 2017, but won't be surprised if better cost discipline
(particularly in Other Bets) drives more stable y/y trends.

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:

- Deceleration in Google Website revenue: There could be modest revenue
pressure due to YouTube boycott impact, and/or ad shift to Facebook. One SEM
suggested a modest uptick in advertising spend on maps, which could be a positive
in 2017.

¢ TAC to distribution partners: Rising TAC rate (Apple, Samsung} could mitigate
potential gross revenue upside in the higher margin mobile search segment.

¢ Growth investments could drag on margins: Investments in Google Cloud,
hardware, and YouTube could be higher than we expect, which could negatively
impact core Google margins and raise concerns on long-term sustainable margin
levels.

* YouTube/Display Network commentary: While we do not expect full resolution on
the YouTube/Display Network issues, management’s tone will likely impact
expectations for timing of a fix, corresponding costs, magnitude of the boycott
losses, and time to recover lost ad spend.

¢ Stock comp timing shift could cause some GAAP lumpiness: Shift in timing of
annual stock-based comp grants could impact 1Q EPS, but should be offset with
lower relative cost in 2H17.

Top 1Q data point:

Our early 1Q checks (pre quarter end) have been mostly positive, but most checks did
not contemplate a potential impact of the YouTube & Display Network pullback.
ComScore PC click data has suggested Google PC queries are down 3% q/q QTD, slightly
worse than the 2% q/q decline in 1Q16.
