I' ve been sampling many workshops at the Convention Center, and
| notice that whenever | sit down on a chair next to a chair with someone
else’ s stuff on it, and the owner of that stuff is sitting on the other side of
that chair, they always tap the top of their stuff in a subconscious gesture
of territoriality. | also observe that a man with one leg (he walks with
crutches) and his wife seem to arrive at every single workshop that |
attend. Hmmmmm. I' m beginning to get suspicious. Obviously, |’ ve
seen too many spy movies.

A cartoon in the 1991 convention program showed two rooms
where lectures were being given. The attendees in the room featuring

“Do It Yourself Porn: Make Your Own XXX Movies” were overflowing into
the corridor, while the room featuring “Socio-Political Ramifications of
Current Trends in the Erosion of Civil Liberties” was empty, except for the
baffled lecturer. It was a nice touch of self-deprecating humor, an
exaggeration not too far from reality. At this ' 97 convention, porn actress
Nina Hartley’ s “So You Want to Throw a Party: Recipes for a Successful
Orgy” attracts ten times more audience than attorney Bob Burke’ s

“Sexual Politics: A Behind the Scenes Look.”

Unfortunately, one workshop, “The Undertone of Sexuality in the

Star Trek Series,” has been canceled— “due,” someone added to the
