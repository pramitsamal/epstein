requires anyone placing an explicit photo ad to provide a photo ID,
nicknames, maiden names, stage names, professional names and aliases.
These records must be available for inspection by the attorney general’ s
office.

Connection had attempted to comply with the law by cutting out
every explicit photo ad from its magazines and sending them with a letter
to those advertisers, explaining the new law and its requirements, asking
that they submit the proper ID or send a_ “soft” photo that didn’ t
require ID. Out of 500 advertisers, only 26 responded with IDs. Patti

with the government just to place a personal ad in a magazine? ... |’ ve
never really thought of myself as an activist, or as one who was

does mean ‘exposing’ my lifestyle to those who would repress it. | am
