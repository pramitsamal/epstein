The majority of cannibalistic serial killers are motivated by a kind of
necrophilia--it’ s usually a highly sexually arousing experience for them
when they eat their victims. Here, from my “Great Moments in
Necrophilia” file, is a dispatch from Associated Press:

“The prosecution in the insanity trial of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer
rested its case. Dahmer has confessed to killing and dismembering 17
young males since 1978. A jury must decide if he will be sent to prison or a
mental institution. The final prosecution witness, Dr. Park Dietz, a
psychiatrist, testified that Dahmer wore condoms when having sex with his
dead victims, showing that he could control his urge to have intercourse
with corpses.”

| smell a public service announcement there: “If Jeffrey Dahmer is

sane enough to have safe sex, what about you?”
