My Acid Trip With Groucho Marx

LSD was influencing music, painting, spirituality, and even the stock
market. Tim Leary once let me listen in on a call from a Wall Street broker
thanking him for turning him onto acid because it gave him the courage
to sell short. Leary had a certain sense of pride about the famous folks he
and his associates had introduced to the drug.

“But,” he told me, “I consider Otto Preminger one of our
failures.”

| first met Preminger in 1960 while | was conducting a panel on
censorship for Playboy. He had defied Hollywood's official seal of approval
by refusing to change the script of 7he Moon /s Blue. He wouldn't take out
the word virgin.

At the end of our interview, he asked, “Ven you tronscripe dis, vill
you vix op my Henglish?”

“Oh, sure,” | replied quickly. “Of course.”
“Vy? Vot's drong viz my Henglish?”

| saw Preminger again in 1967. He was making a movie called

Skidoo, starring Jackie Gleason as a retired criminal. Preminger told me he

had originally intended that role for Frank Sinatra. Skidoo was pro-acid
