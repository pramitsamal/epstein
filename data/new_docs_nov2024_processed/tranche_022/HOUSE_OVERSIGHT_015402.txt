[Courtney Cox is emceeing the event. Now she’ s announcing the
winner.]

Courtney: And the Best Stand-up Comedy Award goes to .. . Jerry
Seinfeld!

[erry walks up to the stage. Courtney and Jerry embrace warmly.
She gives him the statuette. As the audience applause subsides, the blood
flow to the spongy tissue in Jerry’ s penis increases. He _ tries
unsuccesstully to hide his erection with the statuette]

Jerry: Thank you all so much. Well, as you can see, |' m very excited
about receiving this reward. | feel all tingly. And | have a headache. I' ma
little dizzy too. An erection is like a cop. When you want one, it’ s never
there. But when the /ast thing in the world you want is a hard-on—a public
hard-on—then boing! \' m busted, right here on stage, with a spotlight, in
front of five hundred strangers. | feel like | have to vomit. I’ Il try to avoid
the first few rows. And everything looks blue. Especially my testicles. Is
there a groupie in the house? Well, I' m not actually a group. |s there a
singly in the house? Who would like to get laid tonight? I’ Il point the way.
So I’ ve become a human dowsing rod. Now | think I’ m gonna faint. But
even while |’ m lying unconscious here on the stage //erry Is fainting], my

penis will still be a stand-up...
