Knowledge 143

The infinity library would contain every possible symphony, theorem,
novel, poem, and play ever written, or to be written. Its sister library
next door, the continuum library, would contain all the analogue works
of art; painting, sculpture, architecture, physical artifacts and the like.
The curators of the two libraries would constantly argue over whose
collection was the better. We'll leave them to differ for the moment. The
infinity library is interesting enough so let's explore it first. After all, its
sister, the continuum library, takes an infinite amount of time just to look
at the first room, and we are in a hurry!

Although the infinity library is infinite, we are probably only
concerned with entries shorter than a million symbols. All the interesting
papers, proofs and symphonies I know of are shorter than this. If wanted
to include all computer programs, I would still only need to increase it to
100 million symbols. Looking for knowledge is not itself an infinite task.

For the sake of clarity, I will ask the infinity librarian to organize
the collection. Any book or paper will be sorted according to its title and
the contents of its pages, and similar books should be grouped together.
I also only want to look at the English section of the library for the
moment. I will still have a huge section to look through but at least every
work is titled and readable by me. Much of the information will be junk
but amongst the sea of rubbish will be islands of useful knowledge. Now,
is there a way to find knowledge in this library in an automated fashion?
