Consequences

achines cannot discover theorems using algorithms, yet
AY Eee do it all the time. Do the rest of us break the

logic limit? It seems we do. People appear creative — painting,
composing, sculpting and so forth. But, are these endeavors creative
in the mathematical sense. To prove this, ironically we need to find
something outside mathematics that is definitely non-computable. This
is tricky. Most artistic things are fuzzily defined and there are no written
rules we can apply. How can we prove a work of art could not have been
generated by a computer?

Trivial proofs exist but they are rather contrived. For example, it
would not be possible to make a film with a solution to the still unproven
Riemann Hypothesis on the blackboard in the background of a movie
scene. All the mathematics Good Will Hunting had been already
discovered before the movie was made. New mathematics cannot be
accidentally generated by a set designer — unless, of course, they also
happened to be a world class mathematician.

These trivial proofs might lead a mathematician to argue the theory
is proven. There are some artworks which cannot be computed. QED. But
these are not very satisfactory proofs. I could create almost any movie I
wanted without tripping over this rule. What I really wanted to know is
whether Good Will Hunting as a whole could have been generated by a
computer. Not that some weird version with a particular mathematical
proof on the blackboard is forbidden. Movies are a difficult subject for
