Free Will Universe

believe we live in a Universe where information comes into existence

through the creative endeavors of human beings. When Andrew

Wiles discovered his solution to Fermat’s Last Theorem, he did
something a computer cannot do and demonstrated non-computational
thought. But there is an alternative explanation put forward by the
determined determinists.

Daniel Dennett - the standard bearer for this camp — believes
everything in the Universe is entirely determined. He argues there is no
place in the laws of nature for free will to arise.

Both sides of the argument agree Turing prohibits a general-
purpose machine from solving all mathematical problems, but that
seems to be the extent of agreement. The determinists solve the Wiles
Paradox by arguing he is a special purpose machine, perfectly able to
find answers to non-computable problems. The Turing prohibition only
applies to general purpose machines. Let us run a thought experiment
to see what sort of Universe we would live in if special purpose machines
were the answer to this puzzle.

Ifthe Universe is determined, it can be modeled asa single algorithm.
If everything in the Universe evolves according to a set of rules, it will
run like a giant piece of clockwork or one large computer game. Each
solar system, planet, and individual mathematician would evolve along
preordained lines. Mathematicians would operate as software subroutine
and would rely on further subroutines to explain the beating of their
hearts and the way the molecules of their body interact.

If our Universe were organized in this way:

This Universe could not discover solutions to arbitrary problems.
