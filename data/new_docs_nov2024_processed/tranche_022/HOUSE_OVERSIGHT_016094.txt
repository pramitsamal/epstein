404 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

Creative Survival Advantaget — That creativity has evolved to
give us a survival advantage at all stages of evolution, not just when
we evolve to the point where mathematical intuition is significant.

15. Free Will
Laplace Daemon - A conceptual supreme being able to infer
the future and the past from one snapshot of space-time and the
laws of nature.
EPR Paradox — Twin particles would transmit information
faster than the speed of light if quantum mechanics was to be
believed.
Schrédinger’s Cat — The paradox that a cat might be both alive
and dead at the same time until observed.
Bell Inequality — Quantum mechanics forbids local hidden
variables in a testable way. The test succeeds.
Kochen-Specker Paradox — Particles cannot know their settings
before measurement.
Free Will Theorem — Nothing in the past light cone of the
Universe causes a particle to choose its spin upon measurement.
Non-decryptable Universet — The laws of physics mean the
Universe is non-computable in principle.
Free Will Universet - The laws of mathematics mean the
Universe is non-computable and therefore has Free Will.
Russian Doll Conjecturet — Since humans are creative and
non-deterministic and, in a sense, they run upon the hardware
of the Universe, the hardware of our Universe must also be non-
deterministic.

16. The Quest for Knowledge
Technology Hypothesist — The extended strong anthropic
principle that the Universe must have creative beings within it
to uniquely define it.

17. The Future
Creative Non-Singularityt — The future is non-computable and
therefore any increase in computer power, however great, will
never achieve a creativity singularity.
