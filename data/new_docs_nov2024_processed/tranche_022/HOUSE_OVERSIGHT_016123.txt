National Transformation Plan: many promises, few details
The National Transformation Plan (NTP) released by the Saudi government is a further
step towards execution of Saudi Vision 2030 through a set of ambitious interim targets
to achieve by 2020 by 24 government bodies. The NTP is a comprehensive program
encompassing medium-term growth boosting initiatives and fiscal consolidation
measures. The sequencing and details of the fiscal measures are however still left
nebulous. Implementation of growth-boosting initiatives will require a challenging
crowding in of private sector investment, particularly from domestic sources.

The NTP is likely to introduce a number of one-off supply-side shocks to inflation
through its fiscal or labor measures, which could negatively impact Real Effective
Exchange Rate (REER) competitiveness. Discretionary consumption growth and real
incomes are likely to remain under pressure. We find the diversification measures
encouraging, although they appear too ambitious to be met within the time frame
envisaged in the NTP, in our view. The focus on diversification could introduce medium-
term incentives to adopt a more competitive exchange rate, while also detracting from
the binding fiscal constraint under which the government has to operate. Energy policy
is likely to be less aggressive and support oil prices. Fiscal targets are difficult to reach,
but medium-term oil prices of at least US$50-65/bbI could support NTP progress.
