Consumer to face mixed trends

Labour policies are likely to remain a major focus for the Saudi government. Low oil
prices have dented the government’s direct ability to support the consumer compared
to the boom years. Furthermore, negative to flat public sector wage growth is likely to
dampen income and consumption trends, although Specialized Credit Institutions (SCIs)
could alleviate tightening banking sector household lending standards.

The NPT suggests a focus on boosting female employment as well as increasing the
cost of foreign labor relative to national labor. The latter implies a negative impact on
corporate margins and profits, in the event higher labor costs are not reflected in higher
consumer prices and inflation). The negative near-term cost and efficiency implications
of continued labour market reforms are mitigated by the fact that eventual increase in
private sector employment of higher-paid Saudi labour should prove supportive for
consumption trends once the dust settles.

The NTP targets increasing the cost of employment of Saudis compared to expatriates
from 400 to 280. We calculate that the ratio of private sector wages of Saudis
compared to non-Saudis stood at 3.64 and 1.29 for males and females respectively in
2015. The NTP target is thus akin to increasing non-Saudi private sector wages by 43%
over the period to 2020, a CAGR increase of 7.4%. This would squeeze corporate profits,
lead to inflationary pressures in the economy, and lead to annual additional Fx outflows
through remittances of US$2.8bn (0.4% of GDP). As such, it is more likely that the
employment cost of non-Saudis is likely to be increased through measures such as fees
for government services, taxes and levies. It is unclear that the NTP target can be met
solely through this route, but it would avoid additional Fx outflows despite still having a
negative impact on corporate margins and inflation, in our view.

The Nitaqat Saudization program is likely to be extended in the near-future through the
forthcoming launch of the “balanced Nitaqat” initiative. While employment quotas are
likely to be tightened, they will also take into account wage levels, job quality and
women employment ratios, according to local press. A likely target is likely to be
increased job creation for Saudis in the retail sector through higher quotas, in our view.
