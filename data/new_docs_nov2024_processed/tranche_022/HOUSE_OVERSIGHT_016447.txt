Virginia Roberts was working at Mar-a-Lago when she was recruited to be a masseuse to Palm Beach hedge fund

manager Jeffrey Epstein. She was lured into a life of depravity and sexual abuse.

It was Epstein’s contacts with powerful and famous people that first propelled him
into the public spotlight. In 2002, he flew former President Bill Clinton, actor
Kevin Spacey, comedian Chris Tucker and others to South Africa on his private jet
as part of a fact-finding AIDS mission in support of the Clinton Foundation.

But Epstein, a Clinton donor who contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to
Democratic candidates and causes, realized that his Democratic connections
weren't going to help him in 2006, when the federal prosecutor was Acosta, a
conservative Republican appointed during the George W. Bush administration.

ENTER KENNETH STARR

Epstein’s tactic: hire the most aggressive and politically connected lawyers that his
money could buy.

At the top of his list: Kenneth Starr, a Republican icon because of his pursuit of
Bill Clinton during the Whitewater investigation, which led to the impeachment
(but not conviction) of the president after it was revealed he’d had sex with a
young White House intern. Like Acosta, Starr had worked at the prestigious law
firm Kirkland & Ellis. Epstein also tapped Jay Lefkowitz, also of Kirkland, who
worked as a domestic policy advisor and later as a special envoy to North Korea
during the George W. Bush presidency.
