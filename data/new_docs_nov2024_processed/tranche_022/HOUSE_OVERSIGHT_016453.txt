The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their cause remain angry over what
they regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution

agreement have prospered.

By December, Epstein had still not agreed to a date for his plea hearing, and was
technically in violation of the September agreement, which required him to
appear in court by November, Acosta noted in a letter to Kenneth Starr in
December 2007.

“The [U.S. attorneys] who have been negotiating with defense counsel have for
some time complained to me regarding the tactics used by the defense team,”
Acosta wrote. “It appears to them that as soon as resolution is reached on one
issue, defense counsel finds ways to challenge the resolution collaterally. ... Some
in our office are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to mount
collateral challenges to provisions to the agreement, even after Mr. Epstein has
entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the agreement difficult, if not
impossible, to unwind.”

And that’s exactly what happened.
