Jack, my local counsel in NY (we are filing for pro hac vice) has advised that the Court Clerk may require a signature on
the Stipulaion. Out of an abundance of caution, can you sign and return and we will file today. Thanks, Marty

Maksim,

Please find attached a copy of the stipulation with some minor edits, which you can go ahead and file/serve. If you do
ultimately file an opposition, please serve us with copies via email.

Best regards and happy holidays,

Jack

Hi Jack,

We are also enlisting the assistance of local counsel to sponsor Marty's pro hac vice petition. We will provide

Let me know if you have any questions. Happy Holidays.

Thank you,
