2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *894

Because a victim has the right to be heard on a Guidelines issue, a victim also has the right to see the document which contains
the Guidelines calculations - the presentence report. **? Congress intended the victim's right to be heard to be construed
broadly, as Senator Feinstein stated: The victim of crime, or their counsel, should be able to provide any information, as well
as their opinion, directly to the court concerning the ... sentencing of the accused. **4 It is hard to see how victims can
meaningfully provide any information that would have a bearing on the sentence without being informed of the Guidelines
calculations that likely will drive the sentence and reviewing the document that underlies those calculations.

An independent basis for victims reviewing presentence reports is within the victim's broad right under the CVRA to be
treated with fairness. 7+ This right easily encompasses a right of access to relevant parts of the presentence report. The
victim's right to fairness gives victims a free-standing right to due process. As Senator Kyl instructed, Of course, fairness
includes the notion of due process ... . [*895] This provision is intended to direct government agencies and employees,
whether they are in the executive or judicial branches, to treat victims of crime with the respect they deserve and to afford them
due process. 74° Due process principles dictate that victims have the right to be apprised of Guidelines calculations and
related issues. The Supreme Court has explained that it is ... fundamental that the right to ... an opportunity to be heard must
be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” 747 It is not meaningful for victims to make sentencing
recommendations without the benefit of knowing what everyone else in that courtroom knows: the recommended Guidelines
range and how that range was derived. Congress plainly intended to pass a law establishing fair play for crime victims,
meaningful participation of crime victims in the justice system, [and] protection against a government that would take from a
crime victim the dignity of due process. 748 In federal sentencing today, meaningful participation means participation
regarding Guidelines issues.

It is interesting that the federal law allowing appointment of a guardian ad litem for juvenile victims appears to allow for access
to the presentence report. The law guarantees that, upon appointment, a guardian ad litem may have access to all reports,
evaluations and records, except attomey's work product, necessary to effectively advocate for the child. 74° In a recent federal
shaken baby case in Arizona, a guardian for the child victim received access to the presentence report under this provision.
2>0 The guardian in that case found it exceedingly difficult to formulate an appropriate sentencing recommendation without
access to the presentence report. After successfully gaining access to the report, she found a need to change her original
recommendation. She later reported that but for the [*896] disclosure, I would have ended up making a mis-informed
recommendation. 7°!

A victim's right to review the presentence report is also important to ensure proper restitution. Federal law guarantees most
victims of serious crimes the right to restitution. *°* Reinforcing those laws, the CVRA guarantees that victims have the right

43 Magistrate Judge Orenstein of the Eastern District of New York, who has written many thoughtful opinions on the CVRA, has taken a
contrary position. See Report and Recommendation, United States v. Ingrassis, No. CR 04-0455 at 31 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2005) (In the
absence of any change to applicable rules or the Guidelines, the court is under no legal obligation to ensure such disclosure of the
presentence report.). For the reasons explained here, I think he takes too narrow a view of the victim's rights at sentencing.
