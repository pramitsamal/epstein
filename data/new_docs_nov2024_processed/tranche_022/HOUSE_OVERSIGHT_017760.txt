clearly apply to victims. Illustrative of these decisions is the thoughtful analysis by the U.S. District Court for the District of
Nebraska in Bothwell v. Republic Tobacco Co. 3!? Bothwell presented four grounds for its holding that courts have inherent
power to appoint attorneys to represent indigent litigants:

1) courts possess the herent power to bring to their assistance those instruments necessary to ensure a fair and just
adjudicative process in individual cases; 2) in many, if not most, cases, due to the adversarial nature of our system, lawyers are
a necessary component in ensuring such a fair and just process; 3) to a significant degree, neither the private marketplace nor
public or charitable efforts provide indigent litigants with adequate access to legal assistance; and 4) to that extent, such failure
threatens the reliability of the results of the adversarial process. 313

These grounds readily apply to appointing attorneys for indigent victims when important rights under the CVRA are at stake.
Without [*914] an attorney to press her claims, a victim may be unable to obtain a fair and just adjudicative process. *!4
Moreover, crime victim representation appears to be a prime example of a situation where neither the private marketplace nor
public or charitable efforts provide indigent litigants with adequate access to legal assistance. 3!° No financial incentive will
drive lawyers to represent victims in criminal cases. *!© And while pro bono representation for victims is expanding, 7!” it still
falls far short of the needs of victims in the federal system. The fourth and final requirement - that the failure of attorneys to
represent the indigent client threatens the reliability of the system - is also present where rights under the CVRA are at stake.
Neither the prosecutor nor the defendant has a personal stake in the victim's rights, and, frequently, they will have other
priorities and interests that may even be adverse to the rights of the victim. *!* Accordingly, courts have inherent authority to
appoint counsel to represent indigent victims and, indeed, may even be able to require [*915] counsel to serve without
compensation. *!° The local rules of some federal courts already explicitly recognize this power. 37°

In addition to this inherent authority, federal courts appear to possess statutory authority to make such an appointment. Title 28
broadly permits the court in both civil and criminal cases to request an attorney to represent any person unable to afford
counsel. 3?! Moreover, at least one statute already directly authorizes federal courts to appoint counsel for child victims in

authority to require counsel to provide legal services to the poor). Several lower courts have concluded that appointment without
compensation is proper. See Bothwell, 912 F. Supp. at 1230-34 (counsel have a duty to serve without compensation); Family Division Trial
Lawyers of the Superior Court-D.C. v. Moultrie, 725 F.2d 695, 705 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (rejecting argument that pro bono appointment violates
the Thirteenth Amendment because attorneys can take steps to avoid the pro bono appointments and holding that pro bono court
appointments are not per se takings, as accepting court ordered representation of indigents is a condition of receiving a law license, but
excessive burden could present takings problem); Williamson _v. Vardeman, 674 F.2d 1211, 1211 (8th Cir. 1982) (noting that pro bono
service is a voluntary obligation undertaken by attorneys when they apply for a license to practice law); 7vler v. Lark, 472 F.2d 1077, 1079-

with appointment). But see State ex rel. Scott v. Roper, 688 S.W.2d 757, 759-70 (Mo. 1985) (questioning power of courts to appoint counsel
without providing compensation).
