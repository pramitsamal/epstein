Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document1-2 Filed 04/16/19 Page 4 of 4

One of Roberts own lawyers has acknowledged in front of witnesses that Roberts’
claims against me are “wrong” “simply wrong.” The evidence of my innocence is
indisputable: | never met Roberts; | never had sex with her; she simply made up the
entire story for money.

Roberts made her false claims against me in court documents that immunize her from
being sued for defamation. | challenge her to repeat her false accusations out of court,
so that | can sue her for defamation and Let a jury decide—after seeing all the evidence
including the emails and book manuscript—who Its telling the truth and who is lying.

Editors Note: Professor Alan Dershowitz sent the previous response to our story, “Trump
Defender Alan Dershowitz is deeply involved in the sordid Jeffrey Epstein scandal.” |n his
response, Mr. Dershowitz claims Raw Story accused him of having sexual encounters with
Virginia Roberts. Upon careful review of our story, both before and after publication, this is
not the case. Our story reports the accusations leveled by others.
