trouble dealing with my BDSM desires. Ah, my partner said. That explains why you
had trouble letting yourself cry. I decided to nod; to let him think he knew what was
blocking me off. It seemed simpler.

In the morning, I had breakfast with my partner. We hugged and split up, and I went for a
walk until I found a local creek. I sat next to the creek and I closed my eyes and I let the
helpless tears slip down my cheeks.

I'd felt (and I'd known others who felt) this way after the dissolution of a sexual
relationship. But I had never imagined that such a reaction of intense bodily loyalty could
apply to BDSM as well as sex. I hadn't anticipated that I'd feel such heartbreaking,
visceral loss just because I let another man hurt me.

So different, and yet so the same.

BDSM Roles, Topping From The Bottom, and Service Top

I often say that all consensual sexuality is okay. Open relationships? S&M? Same-sex
partnerships? One-night stands? Porn? I could care less how people have sex, as long as
the people involved are consenting adults. This means that most of the interesting and
important questions are about consent: how do we make sure that we always have
consensual sex? How do we ensure that we're always respecting our own boundaries and
our partners’ boundaries? How do we talk about our preferences and our consent? I write
a lot about sexual communication for this reason.

Every once in a while, though, there's something interesting to discuss besides consent.
(Totally weird, I know!) One of those interesting things is stereotypes. Also interesting:
bad dynamics in the BDSM community.
