ranks with The Oppressive Class means we can ruthlessly use their power for good.

Can we do better at making feminist discourses around gender and sexuality open to
normative men, without driving ourselves crazy? How can we make our movement open
to, and accepting of, normative men? Put another way, how do we convince normative
men to support us?

Maybe we don't need a lot of normative men in the camp of sex and gender radicals;
maybe we'll be happier without silly Gender Studies 101 questions clotting our
discussions. Still, even if we don't try to recruit them, I'd love to see more widespread
analysis of masculinity and masculine sexuality amongst normative dudes... if only
because getting a sense for their societal boxes might simply make them happier. If only
because I think they've got their own liberation to strive for.

So at the very least, I'd like to contribute to an America where serious examination of
masculinity and male sexuality can flourish.

That's my final question. How do I do it?

TK OK ok

EDUCATION:
[theory] Sexual ABCs in Africa, Part 1: Abstinence

In 2009-2010, I spent a year in sub-Saharan Africa working on HIV mitigation. It was
fascinating, frustrating, heartbreaking work. I learned an enormous amount about the
possibilities and pitfalls of foreign aid, public health, and global injustice -- far more
than I could ever summarize in an introductory paragraph. Maybe someday I'll write
