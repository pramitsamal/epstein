Unparalleled Hotel and Resort Inventory

Las Vegas has a larger supply of hotel rooms than any other metropolitan statistical area in the world and in return drives extraordinary
spending demographics. The vast majority of Las Vegas’ lodging supply is located on the Strip, and approximately 76% of all visitors (31
million) to Las Vegas stay in hotels on the Strip each year. Luxurious mega-resorts as well as more moderately priced accommodations are
concentrated on the Strip and in the immediate surrounding area to meet the needs of all segments of the visitor market. A comparable

resort district cannot be found anywhere else.

As summarized in the exhibit below, 17 of the 30 largest resorts in the world are located on the Las Vegas Strip:
