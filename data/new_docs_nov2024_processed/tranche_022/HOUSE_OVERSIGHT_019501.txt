PART ONE
SNOWDEN’S ARC

I woke this morning with a new name. I had had a vision.
A dream vision. A vision righteous and true. Before me I saw
Gamers, Gamers shrouded in the glory of their true names.
Step forth, and assume your name in the pantheon. It’s
always been there, your avatar’s true name. It slips through ®
your subconscious, reveals itself under your posts, and
flashed visibly in that moment of unrestrained spite; in the
indulgent teabag. You've felt it, known it, recognized it.
Now realize it.

I woke this morning with a new name. That name is

Wolfking.
Wolfking Awesomefox.
