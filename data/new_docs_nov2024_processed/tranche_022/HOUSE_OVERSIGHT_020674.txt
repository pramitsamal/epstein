This photo, taken in 1973 and titled ‘Burst of Joy’, shows United States Air Force Lt Col Robert L. Stirm reuniting with his
family after spending over 5 years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. The girl with the open arms is Robert’s 15-year-
old daughter Lorrie. The photo was taken by Associated Press photographer Slava “Sal” Veder and won a Pulitzer

prize. “You could feel the energy and the raw emotion in the air,” recalled the photographer.
