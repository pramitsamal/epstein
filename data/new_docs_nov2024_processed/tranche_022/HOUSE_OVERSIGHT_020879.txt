Note: USA federal fiscal year ends in September; Medicaid is jointly funded by federal and state governments, and as a social welfare program (unlike a
social insurance program like Medicare), there is no dedicated trust fund. “Other expenses include family & other support assistance, earned income tax

credit, child tax credit and payments to states for foster care / adoption assistance. **We exclude Social Security & Medicare Part A trust funds interest

Entitlement Spending: Observation About Social Security & Medicare

Part A Trust Fund — More Like Accounting Values Than Real Dollars

e Social Security Trust Fund balance (accumulated annual surpluses + interest income) = $2.5 trillion as of
2009; Medicare Part A Trust Fund balance = $304 billion as of 2009. These surpluses were invested in a
special (non-marketable) series of U.S. Treasury securities, which were then used to finance budget deficits
in other parts of USA Inc. like Medicaid & Nutrition Assistance.

e As aresult, many observers have argued that Social Security and Medicare Part A Trust Funds’ balances
are no more than accounting gains on paper owing to: 1) no ‘real’ assets (such as tradable stocks / real
estates...) in these Trust Funds as the special U.S. Treasury securities are non-marketable and 2) the
Treasury Department needs to raise taxes / cut other programs’ spending / borrow more money in the future

to meet any withdrawal requests.

e We think that for Social Security and Medicare Part A programs, their Trust Funds’ balances have legal
value as USA Inc. is legally obliged to repay the principal and interest on the Treasury securities held in
respective Trust Funds.

e However, we think that these Trust Fund balances have NO economic value as these cumulative surpluses
have been spent by USA Inc. to reduce the borrowing need in the past. When Social Security & Medicare
begin net withdrawal from their Trust Funds (likely in 2017E), USA Inc.’s debt levels + interest payments
growth could accelerate, owing to the double whammy of: 1) loss of revenue source (previous surpluses)
and 2) additional Treasury redemption costs related to Trust Funds’ withdrawal requests.

e Consequently, we exclude Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds’ balances and interest income
from our financial models and calculate their liabilities on a net basis.
