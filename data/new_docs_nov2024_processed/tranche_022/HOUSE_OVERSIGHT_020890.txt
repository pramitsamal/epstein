Medicaid: Observations

e 49 million (26MM low-income children / 12MM low-income adults /7MM
disabled / 4MM elderly) Americans (16% of population) received an
average of $4,684 in tax-payer funded payments from the federal
government for healthcare in 2009. For context, $6,872 in healthcare
benefits is 13% of average annual per-capita income for Americans.

e When Medicaid was created in 1965 to provide health insurance to low-
income Americans, 1 in 50 Americans received Medicaid, now 1 in 6
Americans receives Medicaid.

e That said, Medicaid is an important benefit for recipients as it provides
access to healthcare for low-income adults and their children. In recent
years, Medicaid beneficiaries and benefit payments have risen faster than
population and per-capita income growth owing to expanded coverage,
economic difficulties and associated sluggish wage growth for low- and
lower-middle-income families, and continued healthcare cost inflation.
