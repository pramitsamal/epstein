Drill Down on One-Time Charges

Most of USA Inc.’s recent one-time charges are directly or
indirectly related to America’s real estate bubble and
aggressive borrowing.

First we look at the drivers of the real estate bubble (we call it
‘anatomy of a real estate bubble’), then we drill down on the
past / present / future financial impact of the three types of
one-time charges and the recipients:

1) TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program)

2) GSEs (Government-Sponsored Enterprises)
2) ARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act)
