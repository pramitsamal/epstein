Jane Doe,’ 17, sues in state court
after dropping a federal suit.

WEST PALM BEACH — A former Palm
Beach Community College student who
police say procured underage girls to give
Jeffrey Epstein sexual massages at his Palm
Beach mansion, and Epsteii’s personal assis-
tant have been sued along with Epstein over
their alleged conduct.

The girl behind the lawsuit was 14 years
old when she contends he engaged in sexual
conduct with her after she went to his water
front home in 2005 to give him a massage.
Her lawsuit, filed under the name Jane Doe,

seeks unspecified damages from Epstein for’

sexual assault and intentional infliction of
emotional distress.

She also sued Epstein, Haley Robson of
Loxahatchee and Sarah Kellen of New York
City on grounds of conspiracy and civil rack
eteering.

“We just want a full measure of justice for
this girl,” said her attorney, Ted Leopold.

Robson, who attended Palm Beach Com-
munity College, was paid by Epstein to bring

girls to his mansion for massages and more,’

according to Palm Beach police. “I'm like a
Heidi Fleiss,” they said she told them. Her
attornéy could not be reached immediately
for comment.

Kellen was an Epstein personal assistant
who arranged the encounters, even escort-
jing the girls to his massage room, police
* Tleged.

“These two conspired with”
him to help with the criminal
enterprise,” Leopold said.

Jane Doe, through her
father and stepmother, filed
/ a federal lawsuit against’
~’@ Epstein in January. She dis-

“A, missed: it after her mother
aa? said she wasn’t consulted
Epstein . about the litigation and
sought to intervene. The -:
mother is acting on her daughter's behalf in §
the latest lawsuit. ;

Epstein’s lawyer has denied the girls al-
legations and said her family is simply at |
tempting to get money from a very rich man.
Epstein, 55, is a Manhattan money manager +
who has homes there, in New Mexico andthe ,
Virgin Islands, in addition to his $8.5 million
Palm. Beach mansion.

Two other Jane Does have sued Epstein |
in federal court this year, making similar al- < -

ete ae te ene a tee, amd

_legations to those of the first Jane Doe. Those

cases remain active.

Also pending against Epstein in state court
is a felony charge of solicitation of prostitu-
tion arising from the same alleged incidents
with several girls. That case is set for‘ trial in
July, two years, after he was indicted.

* Jané Doe's new lawsuit, filed in Palm Beach
County. Circuit Court, is the most explicit in
detailing Epstein’s alleged misconduct. It is
the only suit to ihclude Robson and Kellen
as defendants, and the only one to make con-
spiracy and racketeering allegations.

Jane Doe will turn 18 in May. She lives with
other family members in Palm Beach County, :
is nearing graduation from high school and is
working part time, Leopold said. i
