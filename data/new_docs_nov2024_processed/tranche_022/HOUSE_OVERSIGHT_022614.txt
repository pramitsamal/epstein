impending threat of death or serious bodily injury; that the defendant did
not negligently or recklessly create a situation where he would be forced
to engage in criminal conduct (e.g. had been making payments as part
of an ongoing bribery scheme); that the defendant had no reasonable
legal alternative to violating the law; and that there was a direct causal
relationship between the criminal action and the avoidance of the
threatened harm. See Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instr., Special Instr.

‘6 These payments, however, must be accurately reflected in the
company’s books and records so that the company and its management
are aware of the payments and can assure that the payments were properly
made under the circumstances. For example, in one instance, a Kazakh
immigration prosecutor threatened to fine, jail, or deport employees

ofa US. company’s subsidiary. Believing the threats to be genuine, the
employees in Kazakhstan sought guidance from senior management

of the US. subsidiary and were authorized to make the payments. The
employees then paid the government official a total of $45,000 using
personal funds. The subsidiary reimbursed the employees, but it falsely
recorded the reimbursements as “salary advances” or “visa fines.” The
parent company, which eventually discovered these payments, as well

as other improperly booked cash payments made to a Kazakhstani
consultant to obtain visas, was charged with civil violations of the
accounting provisions. Admin. Proceeding Order, In the Matter of
