I don’t think you have to worry about making Hillary look bad, she does that well on her own. After Benghazi,
she lost all of my respect.

Iam so sick of everyone acting like the Clinton’s and even the Kennedy’s are royalty. They are just a bunch of
depraved people, bloated by their excess and wealth. If Clinton has been a part of this w/Epstein, then he should
be in jail too where he belongs.

Why is anyone surprised ? They both have ALWAYS been disgusting and revolting along with greedy and
corrupt !

For the most part almost every creature like this always ends up being a filthy so called Democrat. Look at all
the others that are in prison or should be there now. If they were all in prison we may have a chance of a decent
country once more !!!
