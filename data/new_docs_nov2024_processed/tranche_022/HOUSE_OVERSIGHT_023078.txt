by a continued environmwnt of rising interest. Leverage for S&P non-Financials has
steadily been ticking up over the last few years, and, if we exclude the cash-rich

Technology sector, leverage is approaching all-time highs (Chart 9).

$8-9 (6-7%) hit to GAAP EPS from the mandatory tax on accumulated overseas

profit

We estimate that a tax of accumulated overseas profits of $1.2tn would result in a cash
tax impact of $100-120bn (which may be allowed to be paid over 8-10 years), and a
one-time hit to GAAP EPS of $8-9 (a lower $65-80bn, given that a several large
multinationals such as AAPL already provision for US taxes on a portion of their
overseas profit, resulting in effective US tax rates well above the US statutory rate}. Our
analysis assumes Trump’s/the Blueprint’s proposed rates of 8.75%/10%, and that all
overseas profits are hit with this one-time tax, as suggested by their plans. See Table

10.

Note that our estimate of ~$1.2tn of cumulative profits overseas is based on estimates
from us, our fundamental analysts, and company filings, where in many cases only
overseas cash but not other indefinitely invested earnings are disclosed/estimated.
Thus, the tax on these earnings could be slightly higher, though the Blueprint would tax
earnings not held in cash at a lower 3.5% rate. (We conservatively assume our estimated
$1.2tn is all cash and use the higher 8.75% rate under the Blueprint and 10% under

Trump’s plan in our below analysis}.
