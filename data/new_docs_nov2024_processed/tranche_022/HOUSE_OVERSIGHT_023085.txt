No interest tax shield

Another key offset to the lower corporate tax rate is the proposed ending of the
deduction of net interest expense. We assume that this rule would apply to new debt
and that existing debt would be grandfathered. This tax shield removal would increase
the cost of debt by an incremental 25% (not to mention the 100bp+ rise in long-term
interest rates seen since the summer of 2016). In the table below, we illustrate the
impact on S&P 500 corporate profits. We estimate that over time, the removal of the
interest rate deduction would detract about 4%, or $4-5 from S&P 500 2018 EPS,
although the initial impact would be less significant given 70-90% of the debt is long
term.

Many investors assume that interest deductions would likely apply only to new debt, and
if this were the case, the drag would be gradual for the overall S&P 500 as debt matures
and is refinanced. Companies have shifted the composition of their debt toward longer
maturities and fixed rates. We estimate an average S&P 500 debt maturity of over eight
years, with just one-third maturing within the next three years. The grandfathering of
existing debt is a reasonable assumption, but not a sure thing, in our view. There is a
possibility that legislators apply it to all debt on the grounds that most companies are
expected to be net beneficiaries of comprehensive tax reform.

There is also a possibility that this policy is phased in over a number of years, with
certain portions of the existing debt losing their interest deductibility over time.

The most negatively impacted companies would clearly be the ones with the most
leverage, in addition to those with depressed earnings (Metals & Mining, Energy, etc.).
While the Utilities sector has a lot of leverage, there would likely be a pass through to
customers in determining their allowed rate increase.
