what he called “legal impediments,” including the belief that many of Epstein’s
teenage victims were too “terrified” to cooperate in the case.

“Given the obstacles we faced in fashioning a robust federal prosecution, we decided
to negotiate a resolution,” said Sloman, now in private practice. “We did not reach
this decision lightly and it came only after significant and often rancorous internal
debate.”

In a lengthy opinion piece submitted to the Miami Herald Editorial Board, Sloman
alleges that the attacks on Acosta’s role in the controversial case are politically
driven by critics who failed to raise significant issues when Acosta was nominated
and confirmed as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017.

Sloman’s comments come two weeks after the Justice Department announced it had
opened an investigation over whether there was prosecutorial misconduct in the
case involving Epstein, who ran a sex pyramid scheme from his Palm Beach estate
that targeted scores of underage girls from 2001 to 2006.
