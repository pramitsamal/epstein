>> Of course, your own explanations are deep, elegant, and beautiful. But give it a rest for this exercise and
please avoid citing your own theory, idea, explanation. Also, think of examples that are not completely
obvious—we don't want a hundred people nominating natural selection, or relativity, or Turing machines.

>>

>> Say something new, true, and interesting based on your own experience, in 1,000 words or less.

=

>> Go deeper than the news. Tell us something we don't know. This is not a purely scientific question: this is
question about our culture and ourselves. The ideas we present on EDGE can offer a new set of metaphors to
describe ourselves, our minds, the way we think, the world, and all of the things we know in it.

>>

>> As usual, no politics (Democrat Republican) or politicians (Obama Romney Clinton Gingrich,
etc.). No editorials, Op-eds, opinion pieces, flippancy. No ad hominem comments. No self-promotion: no
referencing your books, papers, courses. No selling from the stage, pushing your well-known agenda. No
footnotes, credits, or hyperlinks in the text: stay on the page. No anecdotes about spouses, significant others,
kids, family pets. Write a stand-alone piece: don't respond to the pieces of other contributors already posted.
>>

>> This is the annual opportunity for the EDGE community to give something back, to provide an important
public service, to make a statement by presenting uncompromisingly sophisticated science-minded thinking to
a wide global audience. Be imaginative, exciting, compelling, inspiring. Tell a great story. Make an argument
that makes a difference. Amaze and delight. Surprise us!
