corruption strategies or help in improving the delivery of services that
citizens want.

Beyond these relatively minor adjustments, a more robust theory of
social change might tell us that, in certain circumstances, the best
way to destabilize an authoritarian society would be not the funding
of civil society groups seeking short-term regime change, but rather
the promotion of rapid economic growth and the expansion of
educational access.5 Conversely, there are many societies we know
will simply waste development assistance dollars because they are
ruled by unaccountable authoritarian regimes. In such circumstances,
it might be a more efficient use of aid resources to cut development
aid entirely and to work only for political change. This is, in effect,
what has happened to Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe, but the
country had to sink very far before anyone considered pulling the aid
plug.

Huntington got a number of things wrong. The authoritarian
transition was not a universally applicable formula for development.
It worked reasonably well in East Asia, where there were a number of
figures like Lee Kwan Yew, Park Chung-hee or the Chinese
Communist Party leadership, who used their autocratic powers to
promote rapid development and social change. Arab authoritarians
were cut from a different cloth, content to preside over economically
stagnant societies. The result was not a coherent development
strategy but a wasted generation.

The aspiration of social science to replicate the predictability and
formality of certain natural sciences is, in the end, a hopeless
endeavor. Human societies, as Friedrich Hayek, Karl Popper and
others understood, are far too complex to model at an aggregate level.
Contemporary macroeconomics, despite dealing with social
phenomena that are inherently quantified, is today in crisis due to its
utter failure to anticipate the recent financial crisis.
