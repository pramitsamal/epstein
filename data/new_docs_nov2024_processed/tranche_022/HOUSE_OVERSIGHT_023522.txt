illustrated the potentially decisive power of one state — Ohio and
Nevada.

A test of Mr. Obama’s support will come June 20, when he will hold
a fund-raiser for about 80 Jewish donors at a private dinner.

John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United
Nations and a possible Republican presidential candidate, argues that
because of administration proposals, Republicans will be able to
make gains not only among American Jews but also among
evangelicals who are supportive of Israel on biblical grounds, and
other voters.

Mr. Bolton said that he was on a cruise sponsored by the conservative
magazine Weekly Standard last week in the Mediterranean, and that
most of the people on the ship “reacted very strongly against” Mr.
Obama’s speech outlining his Mideast vision. “As a Republican,” he
said, “you can use this to show how radical the president’s policies
are on a whole range of issues.”

The depth of Democrats’ worries was evident from the competition to
out-applaud Republicans on Tuesday during Mr. Netanyahu’s speech
to a joint meeting of Congress and from the speed with which
Congressional Democrats led by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the
majority leader, distanced themselves from Mr. Obama on Israel.
‘Are there questions in the American-Jewish community? I think the
answer is yes,” said Mr. Mellman, who is Jewish and has polled the
community for Democrats in the past. “Has Obama been branded as
not pro-Israel or anti-Israel? Not at all.”

“T think he is strongly pro-Israel, in fact,” he added. “But that is the
political struggle in which the Republicans are engaged, which is to
get him branded as not pro-Israel. And to the extent they’re
successful in that, the likelihood is they would have some meaningful
impact on the Jewish vote.”
