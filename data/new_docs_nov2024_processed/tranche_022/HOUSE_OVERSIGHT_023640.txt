want to give you a blow job so much.”

And Trump says, “Yeah, but what’s in
it for me?”
(laughter)

There’s an old saying in psychology.
In order to deceive people, you have
to deceive yourself. Here’s the thing:
Trump has instant belief. He just be-
lieves whatever he says. With Obama’s
birth certificate controversy, he would
believe it, even though he had to know
it wasn’t true. Then, he said he’d hired
investigators to $0 to Hawaii.

EP: (embarrassed for history) | remem-
ber that.

PK: I think that was a lie, too! I don’t think
he ever sent them. Or, if he did

PK: The epitome of it, regarding coverage
of Trump, was CEO Leslie Moonves, who
said “It may not be good for America, but
it’s damn good for CBS!”

EP: You know, the week Trump won, to
deal with shock, my mind started re-
membering things that made me laugh.
One of your stories showed up: The one
when you met Bob Dylan and asked for
his opinion about the Holocaust.

PK: | was at a radio show. And he was
watching in the room. It was me, Abbie
Hoffman, a rabbi, and some others.
During the panel, the Holocaust was
integrated into the dialogue. Dylan was
there watching, sitting in a dark corner in

ternative facts”? It was such a bizarre
oxymoron, he couldn't stop laughing.
EP: My favorite one of her’s is the Bowling
Green Massacre. The Internet was hilari-
ous on that. For the Holocaust, of course,
it’s “Never Forget”; so, for the Bowling
Green Massacre, people were posting
pictures of green bowling balls, with the
phrase “Never Remember”.

PK: Oh, that’s good. It’s like what I was
mentioning about optimism. The answer
is what we saw right after the inaugura-
tion, with the march and the rallies.
Trump is essentially the monster we’ve
created. Whereas Frankenstein was
made from corpses, Trump was made
from fringe subcultures: First

send them, and they didn’t find
any “evidence,” then he lied by
omission...of facts.

EP: | wonder if these lies are
going to have consequences —
if impeachment will happen.
Getting Congress to do it will
be nearly impossible.

PE: There’s little hints that
the Republicans — their con-
science is gettin ‘em. Those are
my hopes.

EP: The fear I have is we're going
to lose this country through this
motherfucker. That we're going
to have a police state — that we
won't have a free press. Do you
think these are real fears?

PK: Oh, yeah. Well, you know,
a police state has a bad reputa-

el

from the white supremacists
.. Trump was on the radio
with some insane conspiracy
theorist, and the host said, “My
listeners, they really love you.”
Trump then went to the Evan-
gelists, ‘cause that was another
subculture. He couldn’t think
of anything, the first time, from
the Bible. Next time, though,
he brought a Bible with him.
He was smart enough to take
the cellophane off it.
EP: | think for the most part,
you've always been on the
right side of history, actions
you've taken and _ political/
moral positions — everything
from civil rights, to women’s
rights, to drug freedom. But I

tion. I mean, cops love it!

The thing is — ever since I
took a lot of acid — I have become an
over-doer of being optimistic. You can
pick your metaphor, but I think Trump’s
a blessing in disguise.

With these scares, he’s the monster —
The Frankenstein — that we’ve created.
It’s from the country’s dumbing-down
of the media. Especially with the com-
mercials. You know, when they first had
TV news, they didn’t have commercials.
EP: I’ve been trying to get more into the
habit of watching PBS News Hour. It’s
amazing to have a full hour of commer-
cial-free news, and not looping news,
like CNN. What’s sad is I find I have to
build up the stamina for it. I actually find
myself wanting commercial breaks. PBS
had less coverage of Trump’s campaign,
too. Probably because there were no ads
to sell.

the back of the room. When the program
was over, he walked up and said to me,
“You didn’t say much.” And I thought
that was funny, because he was such a
minimalist.

Then I held up my fist, like a micro-
phone, and asked, “So, what do you think
about the Holocaust?” He offered his
minimalistic reply: “I resent it.”

EP: That’s just too good a joke.

PK: I remember that, more than the radio
panel, because it had such an essence
of itself.

EP: That’s the benefit of minimalism,
right? It’s like these insane Trump tweets.
In some way, they’re stronger because
they’re just 140 characters.

PK: By the way, did you see Anderson
Cooper laugh for five minutes when
Kellyanne Conway used the phrase “al-

don’t know how you decided
to do some of this shit. For
example, you ran an abortion referral
service inside The Realist. No reward
beyond a moral victory.
PK: Back then, when it was illegal, people
thought doctors who performed abortions
should be arrested and convicted.
EP: Let’s discuss the development of your
ethics. What’s your internal compass?
Have you always had these instincts?
PK: It happens organically. I remember
when LOOK Magazine said about abor-
tion, “There are no humane doctors ...
all of them are just in it for the money.”
And I knew of one: Doctor Spencer in
Ashland, Pennsylvania. He had a reputa-
tion. It turned out, to be, also, that he
was a subscriber.

So, I wrote him a letter, asking for an
interview, because I wanted to point out
that LOOR’s statement was a lie. And I
