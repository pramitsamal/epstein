prohibit, restrict or require disclosure of payments to (and/or certain contacts with) state
officials by individuals and entities seeking to do business with state entities, including
investments by public retirement funds. The SEC also has recently adopted rules that, among
other things, prohibit an investment adviser from providing advisory services for compensation
with respect to a government plan investor for two years after the adviser or certain of its
executives or employees make a contribution to certain elected officials or candidates. If the
Management Company, the General Partner, their employees or affiliates fail to comply with
such pay-to-play laws, regulations or policies, such non-compliance could have an adverse
effect on the Fund by, for example, providing the basis for the withdrawal of the affected
government plan investor.
