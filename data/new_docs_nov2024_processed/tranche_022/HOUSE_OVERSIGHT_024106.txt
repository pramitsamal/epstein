Methodology Used to Calculate Net Returns Numbers for Sprout Healthcare Technology
Portfolios

Estimated net returns numbers for the managed healthcare portfolio of the Sprout funds are
based on New Leaf’s calculations of synthetic net returns. The synthetic net returns for the
healthcare technology investments in each Sprout Fund are an estimate of what the net returns
would have been for these investments, if they had been managed in a standalone healthcare
technology venture capital fund structure rather than one set of investments as part of a larger,
diversified venture capital fund. The synthetic net returns were computed assuming a fund
size required to fund 100% of the total cost of the healthcare investments in each of the Sprout
funds using both called and recycled capital, a management fee of 2% payable quarterly and a
carried interest. The net return reflects reinvestment of certain proceeds, gains and other
proceeds by the Sprout healthcare portfolio synthetic funds to the extent permitted under the
partnership governing documents. A detailed example of the calculation is below.

Sprout IX: Total actual HCT investments of $740M; 2% management fees,
resulting in $120M of management fees and expenses from inception-to-date;
25% carried interest; Standalone fund size of $690M ($735M investments with
cash recycling of 6%); Total realizations have been $1,375M and total remaining
value is $50M. Assumes $130M in total carried interest to GPs already paid out;
Yields Total Distributed to LPs of $1,075M ($1,375M - $120M fees - $130M carry -
$50M recycling) / $690M = 1.56x; Yields Total Remaining to LPs of $50M /
$690M = 0.07x
