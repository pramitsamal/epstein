PME+ Methodology

Public Market Equivalent (“PME+”) is used to compare the net performance of each of the
Sprout HC synthetic funds and NLV funds to the performance of a same size, hypothetical
investment in a fund that tracked a public market index. The investments in the hypothetical
public market index funds have identical cash inflow schedules and proportionately
comparable cash outflow schedules. The cash outflow schedules are set so that the remaining
equity value of the public equivalent fund is exactly equal to the remaining equity value of the
benchmarked private equity fund at the end of the benchmarking period. The analysis is
presented to illustrate the comparative returns a limited partner would have generated by
investing in the hypothetical public market index fund at the same time and in the same
amounts as had been invested in each of the NLV or Sprout (HC portion only) synthetic funds.
The NLV or Sprout HC funds are presented as net, which includes the impact of management
fees, expenses, and carried interest. The public market index funds do not have any impact of
fees or carried interest. A more detailed description of the PME+ methodology used is available
