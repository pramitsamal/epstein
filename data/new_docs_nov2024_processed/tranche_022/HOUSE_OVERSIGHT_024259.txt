Day 1: Introduction

Welcome! We aspire to the implausible: a nine-day introduction to the unusual dynamics of the
world’s digital space, sufficient for a strategic understanding of what makes it difficult (but far
from impossible) to regulate or shape; who’s trying to do it nonetheless; and how such efforts
have fared over the past twenty years, with an eye towards lessons for influencing the space
and the behavior within it today.

In addition to offering some frameworks for thinking about Internet architecture and policy, and
the curious open and generative nature of the phenomenon, we will delve into the net as a
contingently global phenomenon, and the way that complicates regulation by traditional
sovereigns. Our case study will be the current debates around implementation of Europe’s “right
to be forgotten” in search engine results. As you complete the readings, you might see how
you'd answer the question of what a state like France’s view should be towards the scope of its
RTBF regulation, and whether the kind of “zoning” described in the Cato Institute article from
thirteen years ago (!), is realizable and desirable.
