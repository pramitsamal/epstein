This should be built around the common
challenges of radical Islamist terror, border
security, missile defense... and of course, Iran.

And being led by the United States, it could
provide a variety of synergies for all its regional
participants.

Secondly, we need a daring peace initiative vis-
a-vis the Palestinians.

A two-state solution is the only viable long-
term solution.

It is a compelling imperative for us, in order to
secure our identity and our future as a Jewish
and democratic state; it’s not a favor for the
Palestinians...

Believe me, I tried hard as Prime Minister,
together with President Clinton. So | know,
from personal experience, that the Palestinians
are not easy partners for peace.

Prime Minister Netanyahu has taken
courageous steps, to renew the process
including an unprecedented settlement freeze.
