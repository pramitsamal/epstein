Posted on September 14, 2010 by Cindy Van Der Rijt

Four rare works by Picasso thought to be worth over £6m and an 1875 Cézanne oil on canvas will go on sale
during Frieze week next month in an ambitious exhibition to be held at a London property part owned by a
Russian billionaire. The show, entitled “The House of the Noble Man” (12-20 October), will open at 2 Cornwall
Terrace, an 18th-century building off Regent’s Park in London near to the Frieze Art Fair site. The exhibition is
curated by artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, whose works will feature in the display, and Russian curator Victoria
Golembiovskaya. Around £20m worth of art will be for sale, approximately a third of the show, confirms Von
Lenkiewicz.
