Elsewhere in London: what’s on and what to see

Published: October 13 2010 01:20 | Last updated: October 13 2010 01:20

With the absence of Zoo, the Pavilion of Art & Design (PAD) (until October 17; www.padlondon.net) will this year
play second fiddle to Frieze. This sophisticated fair of modern and contemporary art, design, photography and
tribal art from 1860 was conceived by Patrick Perrin and Stéphane Custot and is now in its fourth year. PAD has
retained its place in Berkeley Square, a site that offers limited space expansion, but a sought-after Mayfair
address.

As auction houses all jostle to cash in on the festival spirit, Christie’s is launching an initiative entitled Multiplied
(October 15-18; www.multipliedartfair.com) at its South Kensington saleroom. The focus of this fair is
contemporary art editions — photographs, prints, artists’ books and 3D multiples — and there will be big names,
including John Baldessari, Mat Collishaw and Gerald Laing, on sale for small prices.

Another example of canny innovation — or outsiders crashing the party — is House of the Nobleman at 2 Cornwall

Terrace (October 15-20; www.cornwallterrace.co.uk/boswallhouse). This is a property viewing with a difference:
not only is the house itself on the market, but so is much of the art — including works by Pablo Picasso, Helen

Chadwick and Grayson Perry — that decorates its interior.

While the majority of Frieze Week events take place in grandiose settings in London’s West End, a couple of
contrasting fairs are capitalising on sites in the city’s East End. The Future Can Wait (until October 17;
www.thefuturecanwait.com), an alternative fair started by trusted talent-spotters Zavier Ellis and Simon Rumley,
returns to Shoreditch Town Hall for the fourth year running.
