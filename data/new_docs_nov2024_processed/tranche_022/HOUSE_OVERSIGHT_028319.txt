FRIEZE 2010

This year’s annual London Frieze 2010 was the strongest Frieze fair since the global economic collapse that began
in autumn 2008. Frieze 2010 saw noticeable increases in artwork sales activity; better certainly than the last two
Frieze fairs. Good or bad, these temporary exhibits in ritzy mansions in central London’s most expensive
neighborhoods, are a far cry from the gritty underground art happenings of earlier alternative venues.
Temporarily setting up in fashionablecentral London locales walking distance to Frieze’s fair grounds inside
Regent Park is admittedly an ultra commercial way to sell art.

After all, one might argue, the aim of selling art is the same whether in a humble fair booth, or an exaggerated
mansion. This author admits to attending two suchevents, one in a historic townhouse former embassy of an
African nation,[1] the other in a newly built super-luxury home with not only artwork for purchase but also the
venue — a newly built marble fixtured mansion in Regent’s Park itself for sale, with a price tag of50 million
dollars.[2] The former showed newly commissioned works made especially for the exhibition by a variety of
contemporary artists including Jake and Dinos Chapman, Tim Noble and Sue Webster and Wim Delvoye.

The latter showed everyone from Cezanne to Rodin to Zeng Fanzhi and Yin Zhaoyang, and felt more like a
collective effort of secondary market sale works consigned from various dealers and owners. The artworks one
assumes are used to make the house-for-sale more beautiful and presumably also more sale-able. Interesting
Russian contemporary works were also included, fueling rumors of Russian financial backing for the Regent’s Park
situated mansion-for sale-with-or-without- artworks.
