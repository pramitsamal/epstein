TWENTY artists hailed as stars of the
future are getting the chance to show
their work alongside that of 60
masters, from Picasso and Warhol to
Manet, Rodin and Cézanne.

The 20 were chosen from hundreds
of graduate students in the New
Sensations Prize, a contest now in its
fourth year, organised by Charles
Saatchi’s gallery and Channel 4.

Their workis part of The House ofthe
Nobleman, an exhibition of art bor-
rowed from international collections
that is being staged in an 18th-century
mansion in Cornwall Terrace, Regent's
Park, a stone’s throw from the Frieze
Art Fair.

Four 6f the graduates were selected
to receive £1,000 bursaries to develop
a project for inclusion. They are: Ger-
man Pablo Wendel, 30, whose degree
work involved squatting in a derelict
chip shop to which he built a staircase,
later dismantled by Royal College of
Art staff in a health and safety row;
Katie Surridge, 25, and Russian Nika

Rebecca Wilson, associate director
of the Saatchi Gallery, said: “The 20

shortlisted artists have created a
stunning range of work, including
photography, painting, installation and
sculpture. The exhibition offers a
wonderful opportunity to discover the
bright stars of the future.”

More than half of the graduate artists
are based in the capital. “London is still

one of the best places to do a fine art
degree and has that reputation across
the world, as well as being one of the
most vibrant centres for contemporary
art,” Ms Wilson added.

@ New Sensations at the House of the
Nobleman, 2 Cornwall Terrace, is open
until Wednesday.
