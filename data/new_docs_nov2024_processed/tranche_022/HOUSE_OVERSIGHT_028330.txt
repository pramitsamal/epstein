picked Jeff Sessions to be his attorney general. As a US senator, Sessions was an
outsider to the DOJ. So he wanted someone who knew the department well in the deputy

post (which is traditionally responsible for running things day to day). So he chose

harshly criticizing Comeya€™s handling of Hillary Clinton email investigation, and gave
it to the White House. The very next day, Trump fired Comey and released Rosensteinde™s

of political and institutional norms (the FBI director traditionally stays on for a 10-
year term), and it threw the US political system into crisis. The ensuing chaotic days
were filled with leaks claiming that Trump had privately pressured Comey for
a€eloyalty,a€ that heade™d and urged Comey to drop an investigation into Michael Flynn,
and that heae€™d disclosed classified information to Russian officials in the Oval
Office. With such allegations of Trump apparently trying to corrupt the rule of law,

choice that abated this crisis 4€ appointing Robert Mueller as special counsel to

confidence that the rule of law would be preserved and that, if there was anything to
the Russia scandal, hed€™d get to the bottom of it. Mueller in particular had sterling
credentials as former FBI director appointed by George W. Bush, which likely made him
