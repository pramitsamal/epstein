especially those whose voices might disturb the peace a€ has always been that things
will go better for them if they keep their mouths shut. In my forthcoming book about
the political consequences of womend€™s rage, I write about a 16th-century torture
device called the brank, which was used to muzzle a defiant or cranky woman by keeping
her head and jaw clamped in a metal cage. Some of the iron bridles included tongue
depressors; some of those had spikes on the bottom to pierce the flesh. When I visited
the Tower of London last year, during the week that followed the publication of stories
about Harvey Weinsteinde€™s serial sexual predation a4€ told at long last by women whose
tongues had been loosed 4€ I saw an internally spiked metal neck collar on display. It
was labeled a A4€ecollar for torturea€ and described as something to be A4€eput around

the necks of scolding or wayward wives.a€,type:text}, {identifier: anf-body-

that. Bruenig writes of Wyattd€™s economic precariousness, especially compared to the
