which happens right before the ball. I hope you guys are all planning to attend the dinner as well. You can tell
your friend Jeffrey that he should buy the Mini car for me as a thank you. =)

I’m getting in to Vienna on Friday afternoon. Let’s get together on Friday night.

See you soon,

Kevin

Hi Kevin,

attached please find an information sheet about the AIDS Solidarity Gala — I am sure Jeffrey will very much
enjoy the Gala.

I’ve also included the auction items at the Gala for your and Jeffrey’s information.

Let me know how I can be of further assistance.

All the best,

Lena
