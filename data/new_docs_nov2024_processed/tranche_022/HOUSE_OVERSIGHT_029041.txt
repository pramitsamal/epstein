see what’s been bequeathed to us — ask yourself, 500 years from today, what are they
going to say about me? What are they going to say about what I did at the beginning stages
of this crisis?

Because it is a crisis, and it’s not going away. You don’t have to take my word for it. All you
have to do is read the news every day, see what’s coming up, see what they’re putting on
Twitter, what they’re putting on Facebook, see what’s on CNN, what’s on BBC. See what’s
happening, and you will see we’re in a war of immense proportions. It’s very easy to play to
our baser instincts, and we can’t do that. But our forefathers didn’t do it either. And they
were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to bequeath
to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind, so I think it’s
incumbent on all of us to do what I call a gut check, to really think about what our role is in

this battle that’s before us.
