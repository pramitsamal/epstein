exceeds the applicable threshold amount
(see chart, below) for the year ($1,250 for
married persons filing separately).

Net Capital Gains/ Net Investment In-
come. AGI thresholds are also used in taxing
investment-type income:

a Net Capital Gains are taxed at the 20
percent maximum rate at levels beyond
which income would otherwise be

pushed into the 39.6 percent bracket

(for 2013, that applicable threshold
amount is $450,000 AGI for married
individuals filing joint returns and sur-
viving spouses, $425,000 for heads of
households, $400,000 for single indi-
viduals, and $225,000 for married in-
dividuals filing separate returns. (The
“regular” 15 percent capital gains rate
is likewise reduced to zero percent for
taxpayers in the 10 percent bracket—
a benefit that can be used by same-sex
couples where one partner has very
little income).

a Net Investment Income, as defined un-
der new Code Section 1411, is taxed
starting in 2013 at 3.8 percent, keyed
to a modified AGI threshold based on
filing status ($250,000 for joint filers;
$125,000 for married, filing separately;
and $200,000 for all others).

Deduction!Credit Thresholds. Thresholds
are also commonly used to restrict deductions,
credits and other benefits based upon adjusted
gross income and filing status:

IMPACT. Jn dealing with threshold
amounts, a benefits/drawbacks analysis gen-
erally depends upon the extent to which that
portion of any tax benefit below a thresh-
old amount would otherwise go unused by
one of the partners if filing separately. With
certain deductions, credits or contribution
levels, however, electing “married filing sep-
arately” status may relegate each spouse to
$0 benefit depending upon circumstances.

OTHER SAME-SEX COUPLE
INCOME TAX ISSUES

Being married for federal tax purposes—ex-
clusive of the right to any particular filing

status—can also give rise to additional tax
benefits and restrictions. The following sit-
uations may be particularly relevant in the
case of married same-sex couples after the
Supreme Court’s Windsor decision:

Dependency Exemptions. \n 2012, the
IRS explained on its website that if a child
is a qualifying child under Code Sec. 152(c)
and both parents are same-sex partners,
either parent, but not both, may claim a
dependency deduction for the qualifying
child if separate returns are filed. If both
parents can otherwise claim a dependency
deduction for the child on their income tax
returns, the IRS will treat the child as the
qualifying child of the parent with whom

“Same-sex couples may
find that the benefits of

filing a joint return may
not always be greater than
filing separately...”

the child resides for the longer period of
time. If the child resides with each parent
for the same amount of time during the tax
year, the IRS will treat the child as the quali-
fying child of the parent with the higher ad-

justed gross income.
