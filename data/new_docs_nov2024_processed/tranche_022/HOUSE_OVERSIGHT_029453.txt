social network, which billed itself as bringing democracy and enlightenment to the
world, was used by the Russians to subvert democracy and sow confusion in the
United States.

Even people paid to see the future didn’t see that one coming.

“The board’s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term
problems coming around the corner,” Mr. Thiel said. “We were far from perfect in
doing that.”

Mr. Thiel, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley,
ranging from the tech elite’s fascination with New Zealand hideaways (Mr. Thiel
obtained New Zealand citizenship) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the
problems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to
escape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the
creation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger
audience).

Two subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: President Trump,
whom Mr. Thiel aggressively backed for president, and Facebook, whose core
mission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a
typical Thiel move — he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley
peers try to make themselves inconspicuous — he agreed, in a rare interview, to
talk about both.

“It’s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,” Mr. Thiel said in his new
Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally
looks down on Trump Tower.

Despite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between Mr. Thiel and Mr.
Trump seems to have cooled. After Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National
Convention in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. Trump
wanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.

The investor said he had last spoken to the president “a few months ago.”

“We don’t talk that often,” he said, but added, “I can get access anytime I

want.”
