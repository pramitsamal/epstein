You need a higher calling or some inner system of belief - here | mention Kant and the
inner command that tells you what is true, what is right, what is good. The inner

command must be the divining construct in what you do.

“Music has always been a large part of what makes me tick. You listen to a great work. .
. you hear the majesty of these works and your head and soul gets caught up in them.
When that happens you are in for bigger things and you will strike out to be better.

When | was listening to music | would always have the pad out to write the ideas down. '
