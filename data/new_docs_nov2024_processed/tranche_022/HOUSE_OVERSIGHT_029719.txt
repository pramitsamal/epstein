American forces removed from the
kingdom, for example, Qatar was eager
to compensate by hosting a more robust
American command presence in the

more reliable security partner. Gulf
leaders and military commanders in the
coming decade will be focused on how to
avoid following in Mubarak's footsteps.
Part of minimizing that risk will involve
decreasing security dependency on the
United States. Gulf leaders have to worry
that if push comes to shove, the
Americans will throw them under a bus
