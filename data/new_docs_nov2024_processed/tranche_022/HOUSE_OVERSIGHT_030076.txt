Of course, there would also be an upside to Assad's demise. A brutal
regime would have fallen; Iran would be denied an Arab patron and a
critical window into Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli arena; Hamas

and Hezbollah -- though hardly defanged in Lebanon -- would lose a
critical patron. At this point, however, the administration clearly
judges that the risks of U.S. action outweigh the potential benefits.
Bad options, bad outcomes. So, for now, we watch and wait to see
where the arc on the Assads is headed -- north or south. But if the
Assads do survive, it wouldn't surprise me in the least if Washington
at some point resumes a business-as-usual posture with the only
surviving repressive Arab dictator that's too big to fail.
