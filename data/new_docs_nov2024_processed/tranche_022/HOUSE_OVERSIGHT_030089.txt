The rise and possible fall of the Assad dynasty would provide a
perfect illustration of the Khaldunian paradigm under recent
postcolonial conditions. Under Ottoman rule the Nusayris were
impoverished outsiders struggling on the social margins. In addition
to feuding among themselves, they were fierce rivals of the Ismailis,
whom they expelled from their highland refuges and castles, forcing
them to settle in the more arid lands east of Homs. The Ottoman
governors regarded them as nonbelievers and tools of the Shiite
Persians: they were not even accorded the dignity of a millet, or
recognized religious community.

When the French took over Greater Syria after World War I
(including modern Lebanon and parts of modern Turkey), they flirted
briefly with the idea of creating a highland Alawi state of 300,000
people separate from the cities of the plains—Homs, Hama,
Damascus, and Aleppo—with their dominant Sunni majorities. The
French rightly believed that the Sunni majority would be most
resistant to their rule. Like other minorities the Alawis, as they
preferred to be called, saw the French as protectors. In 1936, six
Alawi notables sent a memorandum to Leon Blum, head of France’s
Popular Front government, expressing their loyalty to France and
their concern at negotiations leading to independence in a
parliamentary system dominated by the Sunni majority. The
memorandum includes the following points:

¢ The Alawi people, who have preserved their independence year
after year with great zeal and sacrifices, are different from the Sunni
Muslims. They were never subject to the authority of the cities of the
interior.

¢ The Alawis refuse to be annexed to Muslim Syria because in Syria
the official religion of the state is Islam, and according to Islam the
Alawis are considered infidels.
