A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East’s most prominent banks did not commit fraud
and steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their
partnership collapsed.

Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment
system because it didn’t want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan’s technology to launch its own service.
The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan’s technology. It argued that it cancelled
the partnership because InfoSpan couldn’t produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an
established company, not one with little to no track record.

After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and
theft of trade secrets.

InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the
possibility of an appeal.

The verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile
attorneys on both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama.

At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back
home through text messages.

Bajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the
business and technology.

To launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled
by the United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund.

It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine
company that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s

The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-
made market for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply
than Western Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system.

A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal’s
fifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees.

But the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009.

A few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they
defrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology.

Two years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was
working and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to
launch its own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan’s technology.

In court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it
abhorred how much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm.

“They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money,” attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing
arguments Wednesday.

Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator
David Boies — argued that the bank resorted to “pure extortion” in an attempt to get its way.

As a result of the bank’s criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa’s partner, Larry Scudder, was detained
at the Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours
