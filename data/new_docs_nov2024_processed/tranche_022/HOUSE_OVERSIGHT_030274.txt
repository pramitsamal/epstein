Netanyahu originally planned to come to Washington with a
generous peace proposal to entice the Palestinians back to the
negotiating table. But Obama painted him into a corner and made him
change his script by notifying him, as he was about to board his
plane, that the President was going to call for Israel to return to its
1949-1967 lines, without also calling for the Palestinians to give up
their right of return. By thus preempting the prime minister, he forced
him to become more defensive of Israel's bargaining positions and
less willing to offer specific, generous concessions. The result was a
powerful speech in defense of Israel by Netanyahu, an
overwhelmingly positive response from Congress and a movement
away from peace negotiations.

All in all, the President's well-intentioned efforts to jump-start the
peace process have backfired, not so much because he favors one side
over the other, but because of the ham-handedness of his negotiation
strategy. A negotiator or mediator whose statements move the parties
further away from the negotiating table than they were before he
spoke deserves a failing grade in the science of negotiation.

What the President should have done is to insist that both parties
immediately agree to sit down and negotiate without any
preconditions.

It's not too late. But it will take yet another explanation of what
President Obama really meant in his ill-advised speech.
