In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful
people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl
issues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You
don’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett
didn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he
has been open about.

So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her
loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look
at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for
all sorts of blemishes.
