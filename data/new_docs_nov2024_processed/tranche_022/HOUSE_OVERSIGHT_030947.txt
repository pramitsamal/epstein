Called to the stand, he told the real truth and not the 302 version of the truth. The Assistant U.S.
Attorney was frustrated and kept on confronting him with the 302” version.

Fed up with the prosecutor and in the presence of the jury, the witness preceded to recount my debate
over recording from the first interview. Pointing to me in the back of the courtroom, the witness
announced that I had warned him that they would pull this crap with the 302 report.

it didn't take the jury very long to acquit.

With the advent of DNA and groups like the Innocence Project, we have now seen that so-called
unrecorded confessions have put many innocent people in jail and even on Death Row. As a result,
