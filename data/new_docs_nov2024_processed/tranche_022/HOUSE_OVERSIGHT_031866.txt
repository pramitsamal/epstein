of the Eastern Hemisphere. A European power trying to dominate the
Mediterranean or expand eastward, an eastern power trying to
dominate the space between the Hindu Kush and the Mediterranean,
a North African power moving toward the east, or a northern power
moving south — all must converge on the eastern coast of the
Mediterranean and therefore on Israel. Of these, the European power
and the eastern power must be the most concerned with Israel. For
either, there is no choice but to secure it as an anchor.

Internal Geopolitics

Israel is geographically divided into three regions, which traditionally
have produced three different types of people. Its coastal plain
facilitates commerce, serving as the interface between eastern trade
routes and the sea. It is the home of merchants and manufacturers,
cosmopolitans — not as cosmopolitan as Phoenicia or Lebanon, but
cosmopolitan for Israel. The northeast is hill country, closest to the
unruliness north of the Litani River and to the Syrian threat. It breeds
farmers and warriors. The area south of Jerusalem is hard desert
country, more conducive to herdsman and warriors than anything
else. Jerusalem is where these three regions are balanced and
governed.

There are obviously deep differences built into Israel's geography and
inhabitants, particularly between the herdsmen of the southern deserts
and the northern hill dwellers. The coastal dwellers, rich but less
warlike than the others, hold the balance or are the prize to be
pursued. In the division of the original kingdom between Israel and
Judea, we saw the alliance of the coast with the Galilee, while
Jerusalem was held by the desert dwellers. The consequence of the
division was that Israel in the north ultimately was conquered by
Assyrians from the northeast, while Babylon was able to swallow
Judea.

Social divisions in Israel obviously do not have to follow
