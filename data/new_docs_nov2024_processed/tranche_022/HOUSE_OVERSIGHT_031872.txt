The exterior lines of Israel's neighbors prevented effective, concerted
action. Israel's interior lines permitted efficient deployment and
redeployment of force. It was not obvious at the time, but in
retrospect we can see that once Israel existed, was united and had
even limited military force, its survival was guaranteed. That is, so
long as no great power was opposed to its existence.

From its founding until the Camp David Accords re-established the
Sinai as a buffer with Egypt, Israel's strategic problem was this: So
long as Egypt was in the Sinai, Israel's national security requirements
outstripped its military capabilities. It could not simultaneously field
an army, maintain its civilian economy and produce all the weapons

powers who saw an opportunity to pursue other interests by arming
Israel.

Israel's first patron was the Soviet Union — through Czechoslovakia —
which supplied weapons before and after 1948 in the hopes of using
Israel to gain a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel, aware of
the risks of losing autonomy, also moved into a relationship with a
declining great power that was fighting to retain its empire: France.
Struggling to hold onto Algeria and in constant tension with Arabs,
France saw Israel as a natural ally. And apart from the operation
against Suez in 1956, Israel saw in France a patron that was not in a
position to reduce Israeli autonomy. However, with the end of the
Algerian war and the realignment of France in the Arab world, Israel
became a liability to France and, after 1967, Israel lost French
patronage.

Israel did not become a serious ally of the Americans until after 1967.
Such an alliance was in the American interest. The United States had,
as a Strategic imperative, the goal of keeping the Soviet navy out of
the Mediterranean or, at least, blocking its unfettered access. That
