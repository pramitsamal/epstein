FRANCIS FUKUYAMA: This really started with a practical concern
I had after dealing with failed states and nation-building issues in the
wake of September 11 and our nation-building efforts in Afghanistan
and Iraq. It seemed to me that the United States in particular didn’t
appreciate the difficulty of this kind of activity, because we didn’t
adequately understand how hard it was to establish institutions. When
I was at Johns Hopkins at SAIS [School of Advanced International
Studies] I ran an international-development program, focusing on
issues of anti-corruption and improving governance. And a lot of it
seemed premised on an overly optimistic faith in the ability of
outsiders to effect desired outcomes. So I decided to write a book
about where institutions came from in countries that had them and
could take them for granted. We’ve forgotten a lot of that history and
how we’ve gotten to the present. Along the way it was also a means
of revisiting a lot of The End of History 20 years later.

SHAFFER: Some theorists, like Hegel, think that history doesn’t just
tell us what is stable, or what works, but actually points us toward
moral progress. Do you believe that?

FUKUYAMA: Fundamentally, I believe in liberal democracy, that
it’s the best form of government, and that the world has made moral
progress. But that’s a separate question from whether the
development of democratic institutions 1s inevitable and driven by an
underlying historical force. I’ve become more skeptical of that latter
belief over the years as I’ve become more attentive to the role of
accident and contingency. And my current book is about a lot of that.
For example: The reason we got to democracy in Europe is the almost
accidental survival of a feudal institution — the English parliament —
into the modern period. That’s something that didn’t happen in other
