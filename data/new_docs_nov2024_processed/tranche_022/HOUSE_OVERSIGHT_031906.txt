afterthought, and that’s what stuck in people’s minds. That was a
mistake, because it kind of undermined the notion of democracy

promotion, simply because it was connected to a very unpopular

intervention.

SHAFFER: Taking lessons from that, what can we do to promote
democracy in the aftermath of the “Arab Spring’?

FUKUYAMA: We already are doing a lot. We’ve got organizations
like the National Democratic Institute, or the International
Republican Institute, that are all over Tunisia and Egypt and Libya,
and other places, trying to help them organize political parties, trade
unions, civil-society organizations, that hopefully will allow the more
Western-oriented democrats in those Arab countries to actually
contest in the elections. As we move toward votes in Tunisia and
Egypt we want to have some alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood
and the military. So we’re giving them that kind of assistance right
now. That’s difficult, because they haven’t had experience with
democracy previously.

It’s a long-term struggle, and I think we’ll be disappointed in the
short run. I don’t think the more pro-Western forces are the ones that
will end up on top in the short-run. But we’ve got to start somewhere.

SHAFFER: Is the spread of liberal democracy dependent upon
persisting American hegemony?

FUKUYAMA: It’s been helpful. The U.S. obviously plays a big role
in maintaining a liberal, open world order, through its alliances and
the influence it projects. And American ideas have been very
dominant in the world especially in the last two decades. A lot of that
is shifting now because of the rise of other powers and other ideas.
