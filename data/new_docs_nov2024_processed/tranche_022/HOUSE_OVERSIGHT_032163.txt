and seize an opportunity. Statesmanship and
leadership..

During the last three years we have been living
through a geo political earthquake. The world
order, which existed since the demise of the
Ottoman Empire , is collapsing. The Arab Spring
appears to have turned into an Islamist Winter.
Borders are erased. Old tribal and sectarian
disputes have awakened. In perfect storm like
fashion Israel now finds itself surrounded by
clashes of civilizations, in addition to the Islam
confrontation between fanatic terror and moderna ,
Suna and Shia, the legacy threats: Iran, Assad in
syria, Hezbullah in Lebanon,Hamas in Gaza are
all still active and worrying.

we have to be alert and ready to strongly respond
to any threat to our security..

But | believe new opportunities are there for the
taking. This opportunity,which might not occur
again for generations ,is the potential to reshape
our relationships with the Arab Moderates based
on our common concerns . Extremism, Terror and
lran. This could open the gate to a more peaceful
Middle East based on cooperation and synergies
