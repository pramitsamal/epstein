Buying Into Palestinian Statehood

June 24, 201 1— Instead of wasting time and energy trying to revive a
moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the United States and
European Union should take another look at the Palestinian initiative
to seek U.N. recognition in September. What is described in some
quarters as a recipe for new strife and confrontation can actually be
leveraged into a win-win situation for Israelis, Palestinians and the
world.

The Palestinians under Mahmoud Abbas want the United Nations to
grant them a sovereign state based on the 1967 boundaries with East
Jerusalem as its capital. That’s all. It is not asking the U.N. to solve
the refugee /right-of-return issue or to determine who owns the
Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is opting to convert an intractable
conflict between a state and a liberation movement into a state-to-
state conflict with manageable parameters.

Why not offer the Palestinians what they want, but add elements that
could render the resolution acceptable to a majority of Israelis?
Israel wants acceptance as a Jewish state with its recognized capital in
Jerusalem. It needs assurances regarding the nature and priorities of
future negotiations, with the truly intractable issues postponed to a
later phase. It needs solid security arrangements, understandings
regarding Hamas rule in Gaza, and a viable incentive from an Arab
world that has long offered to reward it for moving forward with the
Palestinians.

Here are the components of a possible “win-win” U.N. resolution
regarding Palestinian statehood:
