RLK: Now this will not mean overt dissent from the media.
Certainly, that has been suppressed and will arguably for
the foreseeable future continue to be. But in the inner
circles, he is obligated to continue to seek guidance and get
alternative opinions.

HOST: Speaking of the media you just reminded me of
something and we were having a lovely conversation
yesterday. I don’t think either of was being particularly
rude or anything. And let’s put up the video because you
and I were chatting about, just regular Chinese politics and
what was happening and this was what happened in our
office. We were shut down by the censors in the middle of
our conversation. What does that say about how things are
going to be run?

RLK: China is extremely sensitive during this particular
time of the 19th CPC National Congress. They do that for all

national meetings but this is probably the most central time.

All elements of media are under strictures. Who knows at
what level decisions are made? But even internet
connections this week have been terrible because of
extreme censorship. I expect that will lessen in the future.
But it is endemic of the situation and we will all learn to live
with it. As I said, there’s a larger picture here about what Xi
is going to do in terms of his people orientation,
rejuvenating China, comprehensively deepening reform,
and strengthening rule of law.
