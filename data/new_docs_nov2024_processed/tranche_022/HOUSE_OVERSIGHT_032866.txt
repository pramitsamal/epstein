Jeffrey,

Iam certainly glad that you have thick skin and care little about what the press says. I am sorry that you
have to appear tolerant against intolerance.

From all appearances, you fulfill the challenge of Kipling when he said:
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

If all men count with you, but none too much.

In spite of outward appearances, I know very few know how you really feel and I can only hope that that
feeling is shown best in the naming of your airplane.

Jerru
