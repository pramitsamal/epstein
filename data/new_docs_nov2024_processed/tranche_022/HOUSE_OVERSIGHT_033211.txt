“And speaking of walls,” he continued. “In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in
Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It’s a horror show. So we’re going to get things running

The President-elect made building a wall along the country’s southern border one of his main campaign talking

But his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting
in November that it might actually end up “part wall, part fence.”
