Rates:
Pay 5y5y forward 3s6s basis, entry: 11.3bp, target: 13.3bp, stop: 10.3bp (10 Aug 2016)
* Bank hedging flows on the back of sharp pickup in corp issuance suggests the

widening of 3s6s basis is structural. It also hedges any aggressive ECB easing in Sep

Buy 6m30y ATMF+25bp/+50bp/+75 bp payer ladders for a net premium of €950k on
€100m notional (or 3.3 bp) (20 Jul 2016)
*30y rates are at risk from the ECB tomorrow, especially if tweaks to the capital key are

flagged already

Buy 3-year 3.5% ZC RPI inflation caps, entry: 26.0c; current 37.5c (21 Oct 2015)

Short EURUSD 6m 1.0740/1.1500 risk reversal, cost: O (off 1.1077 spot)(6 Jul 2016)
*EUR downside risks are underpriced. We think the post-referendum risk rally is

overdone and could be at risk. Potential shocks include Brexit uncertainty, turbulence in
Italy's banking sector, and political paralysis in Spain.
