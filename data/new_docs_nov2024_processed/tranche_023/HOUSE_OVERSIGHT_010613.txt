* EUR is underpricing Brexit and that shorting Euro was a cheaper way to express such a
view via options. CHF tends to perform strongly when risks become more localized.

Closed on 28 Aug 2016: Buy EUR/USD 6m 1.00/1.20 strangle for 155 usd pips (off

1.1020 spot, DF two-way vols 12.1/12.3) (29 Feb 2016)
*Owning low delta EURUSD strangles may be an effective and cheap double hedge in the
scenario that either the US enters a recession or the European debt crisis resurfaces.

Options Risk Statement

Potential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk

Unlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by definition
governed by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with general options
trading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can
occur in a short period.

Investor suitability

The use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are
considered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are
encouraged to become familiar with the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized
Options (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult
with a FINRA Registered Options Principal.
