What was his motive against you?

A. I was Jeffrey Epstein’s friend and lawyer
and, in fact -- well, I can't get into this. But I
can say this, I gave advice --

MR. SCOTT: Be careful about anything
involving --

THE WITNESS: Okay.

MR. SCOTT: -- Mr. Epstein, please.

A. He could easily have believed that 1 was
one of the causes of his firing.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. So, he was -- he may have been angry at
you because you assisted in getting him fired?

A. It's --

MR. SCOTT: Objection,
mischaracterization.

A. It's conjecture. It's possible. But in
any event, even --

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. It's conjecture, is that what you were
about to say?

A. I'm saying I have -- I don't know what he

A. Yes.

Q. A man who would never undertake to advance
the cause of a client whom he believed to be
incredible, right?

A. Yes. And a man who told me and a man
who --

MR. SCOTT: That's it.

A. Okay. And aman who believes I'm

unless he absolutely had confidence that those
statements were true --

MR. SCOTT: Let me object -

Q. ~~ right?

MR. SCOTT: -- that this is completely

had any sexual encounter with Virginia Roberts.
And if | were a lawyer reading that --
MR. SCOTT: It’s okay?

A. -- [certainly would not base this heinous

accusation on that flimsy read.

Q. You know the context in which that
deposition was taken, den't you?

Virginia Roberts was being represented by Bob

A. No.

Q. You know Bob Josefsberg, don't you?

A. We -- we were classmates at law school.

Q. You know Bob Josefsberg to be an extremely
ethical, highly professional and extraordinarily

. Yeah.
A man of impeccable honesty and integrity?

A. And also know Bob Josefsberg and know
that he would never maintain a friendship, as he has
with me, if he believed that | was one of the,

Q. Well, how about —

A. -- with whom --

Q. -- answering my question --

MR. SCOTT: Wait a minute. No, no, no.

A. You're going to let me finish.

Q. Lknow I'm going to go, but I don't have
to like it —

MR. SCOTT: Yeah, but --

Q. ~- when you're not being responsive to the
questions that are being asked.
MR. SCOTT: Yeah, but you're
interjecting ~

Q. And --

MR. SCOTT: You're interjecting questions
that are irrelevant utilizing Bob Josefsberg's
