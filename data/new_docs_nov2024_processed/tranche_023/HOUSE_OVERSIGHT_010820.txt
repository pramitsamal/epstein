A. Who's -

Q. -~- of Composite Exhibit 10.

MR. SCOTT: Let me see the page you're
talking about so he can --

MR. SCAROLA: I've given you the entire
calendar.

MR. SCOTT: Come on, Jack.

MR. SCAROLA: I've given you the entire
composite --

THE WITNESS: So you're talking about my
wife's --

MR. SCAROLA: Fourth page -- fourth page
of Exhibit 10. You have Exhibit 10, I've given
a copy of that.

MR. SCOTT: I understand it and he has it
front of him and I'm trying to get him to the
right page. Thank you. Please take it down.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Fourth page, Composite Exhibit 10.

A. Yes.

Q. Friday, January 12.

A. Okay. That's very simple. We were both
in Cambridge and I had a massage in Cambridge. How
do I know that? Because it had basketball. And
that's where J play and watch basketball was in

A. Uh-huh.

Q. Okay. Or from 3:30 to 4:15, that would be
a playing time for you in Cambridge; is that
correct?

A. You'd be asking me to speculate. I can't
speculate based on my wife's calendar. It says
utility bill, Reservoir address. That suggests
Cambridge. Reservoir is our house in Cambridge.

Q. So, it would appear that this is another
massage that you got somewhere?

A. But 1 would like to also say one thing. I
don't -- I at least wonder were these records
available to your clients at the time they made the
false accusations against me or arc they
aftcr-the-fact constructs designed to simply try to
find excuses to justify their false allegations? It
seems to me the latter is probably the case.

Q. And you are going to have an opportunity
through your counsel to ask those questions.

A. And we will.

Q. And my clients are anxious to be able to
answer those questions.

A. Not as anxious as I am to hear their
answers.

Q. Okay.

Cambridge. So probably I was in Cambridge if it
says B ball 3:30, 4:15 and says Cambridge with Ella,
so I'm sure | was in Cambridge.

Q. Allright. So-

A. But I'm -- I'm looking at my wife's
calendar. I can't tell you and nor can you tell me
where | was at that period of time.

Q. So, the basketball entries are references
to your watching basketball in Cambridge?

A. No. They could be playing basketball. J
played basketball in those days --

Q. Watching or playing basketball?

MR. SCOTT: Let him finish his answer,
please.

A. either watched basketball or played
basketball, yeah. 1 did not go to basketball games
in New York, to my recollection, unless the Celtics
were in New York and maybe we can check --

MR. SCOTT: You've got about five minutes,

Counsel,

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. The Celtics didn't play from 4:15 to 5:00,
did they?

A. No, but I did.

Q. You did?

MR. SCOTT: Okay. Let's wrap it up.

MR. SCAROLA: Not quite.

MR. SCOTT: Yeah, it's 12:30. I'm ending
this. That gives you three and a half hours.
We take a lunch break and then we have three
and a half.

MR. SCAROLA: We don't need three and a
half hours for lunch.

MR. SCOTT: No, I didn't say that, I said
we take an hour break and then we have three
and a half hours with your client, just like...

MR. SCAROLA: If -- if that's what you
want to do --

MR. SCOTT: That's the fair thing to do
because that's why we're dividing it equally
and I suggested that --

MR. SCAROLA: | will state -- J will state
for the record that Exhibits 2, 3 and 4 --
excuse me, Exhibits 9, 10, 11 and 12,
composite exhibits, directly conflict with the
witness's assertion --

MR. SCOTT: This is all a speech on your
part.

MR. SCAROLA: It is a speech.

MR. SCOTT: Itis a speech and --
