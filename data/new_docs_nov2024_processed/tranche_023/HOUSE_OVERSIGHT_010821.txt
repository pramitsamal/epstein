MR. SCAROLA: I'm giving you notice as to
what you can do to do your homework. Okay?
They directly conflict with the witness's

assertion that the flight logs exonerate him.
In fact --

MR. SCOTT: Wait a minute.

MR. SCAROLA: -- the flight logs -- the
flight logs corroborate Virginia Roberts’
assertions.

MR. SCOTT: And I thank you very much for
that explanation and we look forward to
resuming this at the appropriate time and
responding to that.

THE WITNESS: And that is a false
statement.

MR. SCOTT: Thank you.

VIDEOGRAPHER: Going off the record. The
time is approximately 12:26 p.m.

(The proceedings ADJOURNED at 12:26 p.m.)
