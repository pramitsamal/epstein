Another thing that I had, and I will not
reveal any privileged communications here or any
confidential information, but on December 30th, I
was aware that one of the preeminent lawyers in
the United States, David Boies, had agreed to
represent Virginia Roberts. And given the vast
amount of business that -- that, you know, tries
to get in the door --

MR. SIMPSON: Could I interrupt? I mean, I
think we are going towards a waiver here.

MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah. No, no, no, I do not --

MR. SIMPSON: We can't have testimony
about --

MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah.

MR. SIMPSON: -- this is one of the most
respected people in the country, or lawyers in
the country, and then you won't answer the
questions --

THE WITNESS: Okay.

MR. SIMPSON: -- you said not to answer.

MS. McCAWLEY: Oh. Well, describing David
Boies in general --

MR. SIMPSON: I agree with the description.

MS. McCAWLEY: -- doesn't constitute a
waiver.

MR. SIMPSON: He's a distinguished lawyer.

MR, SCAROLA: And I don't think we are
getting beyond anything that is a matter of
public record.

MR. SIMPSON: I just -- I --

MS. McCAWLEY: But I appreciate you --

MR, SIMPSON: Be aware of waiver.

MS, McCAWLEY: -- letting me know that.

THE WITNESS: Allright. I will be -- I will
not waive anything, and if I start to do that, I
would certainly request the opportunity to -- to
retract what I'm doing, but I was aware -- since
the issue is, well, what's in the public record,

I was aware that, you know, probably the most
significant United States Supreme Court case
argued in the last 20 years was Bush versus Gore,
which was a case that essentially determined who
was going to be President of the most powerful
country in the world.

There were two attorneys who argued that case
in front of the United States Supreme Court, and
arguing for the Democratic Presidential
Candidate, Al Gore, was David Boies.

He had put his credibility on the line in
arguing the Bush versus Gore case, and without

going into any confidential communications or
trying to waive in any way, I knew that David
Boies had agreed to represent Virginia Roberts,
which gave me additional confidence in the fact
that I was also representing this young woman in
her effort to bring sex traffickers to justice,
and those who had sexually abused her to justice.

And so those are things that come to mind
immediately as -- let me just take a second and
see if there were other things regarding
Dershowitz that -- that come immediately --
immediately to mind.

Oh, one of the things was in the Jane Doe 102
complaint, which alleged academicians that had --
that had abused -- sexually abused Jane Doe 3,
there -- there were -- so that raises a question,
obviously, of who were the academicians that Bob
Josefsberg had identified?

I can't recall, actually. Let me -- the
record should be clear, I can't recall
immediately whether it was singular or plural.

It may have been plural, but if it's singular, I
don't want to suggest that there were other
academicians, but at least one academician had
sexually abused Jane Doe 3, according to the
ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400

complaint that had been filed by Bob Josefsberg.

There were two things that were of interest
to that: One was that Mr. Epstein, the man that
I wasn't able to get information from because he
was invoking the Fifth, had refused or declined
to file an answer to that complaint.

Rather than deny the allegations, he had,
ultimately, it's my understanding -- I don’t have
inside information and I'm not trying to waive
any information, but my understanding is that
rather than answer the complaint, he settled the
case through the payment of some kind of
compensation that Jane Doe 102 found desirable
for dropping her claim.

The other thing that I found interesting is
that Josefsberg's partner, I believe it is,

Miss Ezell, had been to some of the depositions
of, for example, I believe Juan Alessi and
Alfredo Rodriguez. And I believe at least one of
those, and perhaps both of those. And she had
asked questions about Alan Dershowitz in those
depositions, but had not asked questions about
other academics in those depositions.

So that led me to conclude that Bob
Josefsberg and his outstanding law firm had
