identified Alan Dershowitz as someone who had 020923 1
information relevant -- and let's be clear, that o20825 2
this is not a lawsuit about some contract dispute 020928 3
or something -- that he was someone who had 20323 4
information relevant to the sexual abuse of o20c30 5
underage girls and, indeed, they were asking o20832 §
questions about what information -- what o20934 7
information he might have. o2038 8

Another -- I know, I remember now, there's a ozoo28 9
whole other line of things that -- that I had in ozoaar 10
mind at the time, and I think since you want to o2zos43 11
test my memory -- I'm not -- let me be clear. orooas 12
I'm not claiming I have a superb memory. I have ozosaa 13
an average memory, but this is a subject that's 020052 14
very important to me, and so I've worked, you ozossa 15
know, very hard to get all the information. ozoes7 16

I want to do a good job for Virginia Roberts o210.27 1
on -- on representing all the -- the evidence o2t028 2
that is available to support her. ozt031 8

The next thing that I was thinking of was, oz1o3s | 4
all right, then the question is: Well, what does ozto38 5
Mr. Dershowitz have to say about all this? So I ozt01 « &
started to look at the information on that as o2toas | 7
well. oie | 8

In 2009, there had been a deposition request oz1048 | 9
sent to Mr. Dershowitz, and I -- I saw a document e2z1050 10
showing that that had actually been served on -- oztoss 11
on him, and, you know, to the extent that what I o2zto 42
saw was a -- I think a receipt from the process o2t101 13
server, or something along those lines, so I saw o2z1108 14
attempt to contact him in -- in 2009. ozii07 15

And then I saw an additional attempt to oz 16
contact him in 2011. Mr. Scarola had sent him a oz11ts 17
note and there was, you know, some back and oz 18
forth. The -- the one note that -- that jumped ori 19
out to me was one in which Mr. Scarola had o2tr21 20
written to Mr. Dershowitz, I think the phrase ozi121 24
was: Multiple witnesses have placed you in the ozt123 22
presence of Jeffrey Epstein and underage girls; I ori126 23
would like to depose you about those subjects. o2ti2s 24

And the answer that came back was not, well, 021131 25

103
let me clear all of that misunderstanding up.
You know, that's -- frankly, if I had gotten
something like that, that's what I would have
said.

The answer that came back was -- from
Mr. Dershowitz was something along the lines of,
if I remember correctly, well, tell me what
you -- you -- tell me what you want to know and
I'll decide whether to cooperate, was I think
the phrase that was used. And -- and so there
was an attempt, you know, a 2009 attempt, a 2011
attempt to get information from Mr. Dershowitz.

Then there was another subpoena without
deposition for -- for documents. You know, we
have heard a lot about records in this case that
could prove innocence. There was a records
request to Mr. Dershowitz in 2013. And, again,
my understanding was that there was no -- you
know, no documents were provided on that.

And so those -- I had that information.
Another bit of information that I had was that in
2011, I believe in early April -- this is not
attorney/client privileged information from
Virginia Roberts. This is a telephone call that
she placed from Australia where she had been

essentially forced into hiding by Jeffrey
Epstein. She managed to escape and was hiding
out in -- in Australia, and that she would --
that somehow, you know, Mr. Scarola and
Mr. Edwards were able to reach her and there was
a telephone call that was made.

And in that telephone call she identified
Alan Dershowitz as someone who would have
relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein and
the sexual abuse of underage girls.

And so I had that information as well. So
that, as I understand, the question was: What
could I recall off the top of my head with regard
to the factual basis for information connecting
Mr. Dershowitz with the sexual abuse of minor
girls, plural, and that, sitting here at this
moment, is the best that I can recall for the
information along those lines.

BY MR. SIMPSON:
Q. Was that answer --

MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. Before -~ before
you go on to another subject, Professor Cassell
is entitled to refresh his recollection to give
you a complete response. So why don't you go
ahead and do that now. Make sure you've covered
