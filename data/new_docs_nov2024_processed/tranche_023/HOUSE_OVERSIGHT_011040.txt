The terms gross cash flow, earned revenue and gross realized output will be used

interchangeably. “Realized” and “recovered” will likewise be synonymous, as will be

tt

“proprietary”, “unrealized” and self-invested”.

(A6.1) allows

realized output = cash flow + plowback + transfer in
- recovered decapitalizaiton. (6.1a)

Define

unrealized output = output - realized output
= growth + cash flow - realized output
= growth - plowback - transfer in
+ recovered decapitalization, (6.9)

by (6.1a) and the total return truism.

Proprietary Output and Deadweight Loss

Unrealized or proprietary or self-invested output of the firm is creation of value not
yet sold or not meant to be sold. This can be something as workaday and
perfunctory and automatic as output to inventory. Other illustrations could be
where a construction firm builds its own offices, or a car manufacturer makes cars
for its executive fleet. (6.9) shows that it includes all growth not explained by
plowback plus transfer in less recovered decapitalization. This implicitly includes all
free growth. Judging from my charts and tables, free growth seems to mean all of

growth at the collective scale. What effect might it have on the firm?

Free growth includes random windfall gain and deadweight loss as well as the
overall upward trend expressing new ideas. Deadweight loss is unrecovered

decapitalization, meaning not recovered in cash flow, That makes it negative output
