as the sum of growth and cash flow, and specifically negative unrealized output.

Then

deadweight loss = unrecovered decapitalization
= negative output
= negative unrealized output
= max (0, - output)

= max (0, - unrealized output). (6.10)

Also
positive unrealized output = max (0, proprietary output), (6.11)

and
output = unrealized output + realized output. (6.12)

The Growth Truism

In general,
growth = capitalization from outside + capitalization from inside
- decapitalization. (6.13)
Here

capitalization from outside = negative cash flow = transfer in, and
capitalization from inside = positive unrealized output + plowback.

Also
decapitalization = recovered decapitalization + unrecovered decapitalization
= recovered decapitalization + deadweight loss.
Then

growth = transfer in + positive unrealized output + plowback
— recovered decapitalization - deadweight loss, (6.14)
