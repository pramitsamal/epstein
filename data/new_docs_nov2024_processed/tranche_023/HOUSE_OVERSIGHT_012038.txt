A Master at Work: Dissecting the Closing Argument in Latham's Huge Win for Middle Eastern Bank
Jenna Greene08/14/2016

For Latham & Watkins, defending a Middle Eastern bank accused of stealing trade secrets from a plucky
American entrepreneur could have been a tough sell to a federal jury in Orange County, California.

[http://www.law.com/image/LitDaily/DailyDicta.jpg|]The stakes were high--more than half a billion dollars in

damages--and some of the facts were, ahem, challenging.

How did Latham lawyers turn a potentially unsympathetic narrative into a unanimous win for Dubai-based
Emirates NBD Bank PJSC on Thursday?

A look at closing arguments by Latham partner Kathryn Ruemmler, who made her first in-court appearance
since she stepped down as White House counsel in 2014, is revealing in a watch-the-master-at-work kind of
way.

Along with Latham partners Daniel Schecter and Dean Dunlavey, she faced off against an equally formidable
opponent: Boies, Schiller & Flexner partner William Isaacson, who wasnamed a litigator of the
year<http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202745 123270/Litigator-of-the-Y ear-William-Isaacson-of-Boies-
Schiller> by The American Lawyer in 2015.

Ruemmler parachuted into the case on May 20, replacing Steven Bauer. He had another case (on behalf of
Pacific Gas & Electric<http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202764714611/Split-Verdict-in-PGE-Pipeline-Blast-
Case?slreturn=20160712215338>) going to trial at the same time and couldn’t convince U.S. District Judge
James Selna to push back the trial date, which had already been delayed several times.

This was the lay of the land: Two weeks before, the Los Angeles Times on May 8 had run a lengthy
feature<http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-infospan-lawsuit-20160508-story.html> that was distinctly
sympathetic to the plaintiff, Farooq Bajwa. A former computer components manufacturer/ El Pollo Loco
franchise owner, his latest venture was a company called InfoSpan Inc.

Bajwa is portrayed as a visionary who had an idea to allow foreign workers to easily and cheaply send funds
back to relatives in their home country via the internet or cell phone.

I realized I might make a big difference in this world not only helping these underprivileged people who don't

have bank accounts, I will also be helping bring an economic revolution, Bajwa, 64, told the paper. I had
very big dreams.”
