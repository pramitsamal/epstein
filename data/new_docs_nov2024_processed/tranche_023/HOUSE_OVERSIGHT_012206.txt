Re: Jaffrey Epstein
Dear Jay;

Several things have come to my attention that Seem contrary to your client intending ta abide
by his obligations uder the Non-Prosecution A ereement. As you know, that agreement requires our
Office to inform you of potential breaches to give you and your client the opportunity to respond
before an indictment is filed. At this tire, I do not believe that the agreement has been breached;
however, I have sufficient concerns that need to be addressed,

First, understand that private investigators working for Mr. Epstein have contacted victims
to ask them whether any detectives or FBI agents have discussed a financial settlement with them,
On one occasion, the private investigators told the parent of a victim that she should get an attorney
for her daughter and she should do so right away. These actions are troublesome because the FRI
agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of the matter, which includes
informing them that, as part of the resolution, that Mr, Epstein has agreed to pay damages in some
circumstances. Furthetmore, Mr, Epstein well knows that we are in the process of selecting an
attorney to represent the vietims and, but for the inordinate amount of time spent negotiating the
Addendum, that attorney would already have been selected, Paragraph 7 of the Non-Prosecution
Agreement explicitly provides that contact with the victims shall be through that counsel,
Accordingly, please confirm that there will ba no further efforts to contact any victims until Judge
Davis selects the attomey representative and that, thereafter, contact will be made only through that
counsel.

Second, the Non-Prosecution Agreement requires Mr, Epstein to use his best efforts to enter
his guilty plea and to be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007, Despite this obligation, the
Oifice agreed that My, Epstein could postpone this deadline to November, but reiterated that My.
