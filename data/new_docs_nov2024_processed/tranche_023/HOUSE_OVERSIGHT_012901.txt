This book 1s dedicated by Ben Goertzel to his beloved,
departed grandfather, Leo Zwell — an amazingly
warm-hearted, giving human being who was also a deep
thinker and excellent scientist, who got Ben started on the
path of science. As a careful experimentalist, Leo would
have been properly skeptical of the big hypotheses made
here — but he would have been eager to see them put to the

test!
