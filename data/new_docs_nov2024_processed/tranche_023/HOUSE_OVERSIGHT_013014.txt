and processes, embodied in having separate boxes for Working Memory vs. Reactive Processes,
and for Long Term Memory vs. Deliberative Processes, could be viewed as somewhat artificial,
since in the human brain and most AGI architectures, memory and processing are closely inte-
grated. However, the tradition in cognitive psychology is to separate out Working Memory and
Long Term Memory from the cognitive processes acting thereupon, so we have adhered to that
convention. The other changes from Sloman’s diagram are the explicit inclusion of language,
representing the hypothesis that language processing is handled in a somewhat special way in
the human brain; and the inclusion of a reinforcement component parallel to the perception and
action hierarchies, as inspired by intelligent control systems theory (e.g. Albus as mentioned
above) and deep learning theory. Of course Sloman’s high level diagram in its original form is
intended as inclusive of language and reinforcement, but we felt it made sense to give them
more emphasis.

Figure 5.2, modeling working memory and reactive processing, is essentially the LIDA di-
agram as given in prior papers by Stan Franklin, Bernard Baars and colleagues [BF 09]. The
boxes in the upper left corner of the LIDA diagram pertain to sensory and motor processing,
which LIDA does not handle in detail, and which are modeled more carefully by deep learning
theory. The bottom left corner box refers to action selection, which in the integrative diagram
is modeled in more detail by Psi. The top right corner box refers to Long-Term Memory, which
the integrative diagram models in more detail as a synergetic multi-memory system (Figure
5.4),

The original LIDA diagram refers to various codelets, a key concept in LIDA theory. We
have replaced attention codelets here with attention flow, a more generic term. We suggest
one can think of an attention codelet as: a piece of information stating that, for a certain group
of items, it’s currently pertinent to pay attention to this group as a collective.
