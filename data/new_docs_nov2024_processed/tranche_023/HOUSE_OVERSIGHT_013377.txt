b. Epstein’s Allegations of Negligence by Edwards are Unfounded and Not
Actionable in Any Event.

In his Second Amended Complaint Epstein recognizes at least the possibility that
Edwards was not involved in any Rothstein Ponzi scheme. Therefore, seemingly as a fallback,
Epstein alleges without explanation that Edwards “should have known” about the existence of
this concealed Ponzi scheme. Among other problems, this fallback negligence position suffers
the fatal flaw that it does not link at all to the intentional tort of abuse of process alleged in the
complaint.

Epstein’s negligence claim is also deficient because it simply fails to satisfy the
requirements for a negligence cause of action:

“Four elements are necessary to sustain a negligence claim: 1. A duty, or

obligation, recognized by the law, requiring the [defendant] to conform to a

certain standard of conduct, for the protection of others against unreasonable

risks, 2. A failure on the [defendant’s] part to conform to the standard required: a

breach of the duty ....3. A reasonably close causal connection between he

conduct and the resulting injury. This is what is commonly known as ‘legal

cause,’ or ‘proximate cause,’ and which includes the notion of cause in fact. 4.

Actual loss or damage.

Curd v. Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, —-— So.2d__, 2010 WL 2400384 at *9 (Fla. 2010). Epstein
does not allege a particular duty on the part of Edwards that has been breached. Nor does
Epstein explain how any breach of the duty might have proximately caused him actual damages.
Summary judgment is therefore appropriate for these reasons as well.

Finally, for the sake of completeness, it is worth noting briefly that no reasonable jury

could find Edwards to have been negligent in failing to anticipate that a managing partner at his

law firm would be involved in an unprecedented Ponzi scheme. Scott Rothstein deceived not
