2? +0 x 2'+0 x 2°(in which the last term, arbitrarily, is 2° = 1, since anything to
the power O = 1). This can be written even more simply as a series of 0’s or 1’s,
their presence indicating whether the power represented by each place in the left to
right descending sequence of powers of two participates in the sum of the partition.
It is in this way that in binary numbers, 100 = 110010. As another example, if we
similarly partition the decimal number 729 = 512 (2°) + 128 (2”) + 64 (2°) + 16 (2°) +
8 (2°) + 1(2°), we find that its binary transformation results in 729 = 1011011001,
the 0’s representing the descending powers of two that are absent in the powers of
two partition. One can compute the binary representations of lower valued numbers
immediately; for example, 4 = 1 x 27 +0 x 2'+0 x 2°s0 that there is a 1 in the
multiply-the-power-of- two column and 0 the power 1 and power O columns so in
binary representation, 4 = 100. Similarly, 6 = 1 x 22+ 1 x 2'+0 x 2° making the
binary transformation of 6 = 110.

It was the co-inventor (with Isaac Newton) of the calculus, Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz, in about 1665, who fully developed the binary representation of all decimal
numbers. |n a state of wonderment about the simplicity, power and completeness of
this 1 and 0 encoding, he is said to have the beliefs that 0 symbolized the
emptiness of the universe’s beginnings, 1 represented the complete fullness of God
and that this transformation served as metaphoric evidence consistent with God’s
creation of the universe out of nothing.

The simplicity of binary expressions as in the dynamics of hard spheres or
rotations on the circle as well as the transformations such as 729 = 1011011001
make them propitious for exemplifying the methods for computing the entropies of
the growth rate of the possible, called the topological entropy, Hr, and the probable,
the metric entropy, Hy, which was introduced in a previous chapter called “Sensual
In-Between Entropies.” The following exemplify the computations of measures of
topological and metric entropies, Hr and Hy, another computable idea called
algorithmic complexity, AC and finally, the well known (to statisticians) standard run
score, src. Their descriptions have as their purpose a demonstration for the reader
that these apparently abstract, perhaps nebulous sounding, words can be

transformed into well-defined, concrete, quantitative and computable form of reality.
