the standard run score of the binary series is less than zero and therefore more

and tails minus one. That is, Var(E(r)) = = 2.03. From these

=-0.140. We conclude that

random than the expected random behavior of a fair coin.

Recall from the last chapter that Karen Selz, Martin Paulus and others have
shown that various personality types and psychiatric diagnoses are associated with
characteristic deviations of srs from zero. When the winners of the 2002 Annual
World Rock, Paper Scissors Championships held in Montreal Canada were
interviewed, they said that sensing their opponent’s characteristic style of deviations
from randomness in what we would call the continuum from maximal to minimal
entropy determined their successes. We characteristically use all of these measures
to estimate quantitate the deviation from randomness standard run score, Srs,
algorithmic complexity, AC, as well as H; and Hy,, the topological and metric
entropies.

The encounter with mystical Absolute Reality, though sought by arduous
contemplative and other practice, emerges spontaneously, most often during times
of apparent mental emptiness, detachment, a state in which rationally instructive
thought and the choral background of brain voiced, emotion-ladened, commentary
have disappeared into the entropic soup of formless silence. It is this indescribable,
ineffable, stillness that we think serves as the psychophysiological anlage of
mystical experience. The mathematical systems yielding quantitative metaphors,
descriptive ideas about dynamical entropic statistical emptiness and form inspire the
use of mathematical structures in place of localized lumps in brain meat as
personalized icons of doing.

Our wedding of well-defined mathematical objects to metaphoric elements of

more general nonverbal intuition has a long tradition. Rene Thom’s 1990 book,
