How I got to this point is a tad less glamorous:

1977 Born 6 weeks premature and given a 10% chance of living. I survive instead and grow so fat that
I can’t roll onto my stomach. A muscular imbalance of the eyes makes me look in opposite directions,
and my mother refers to me affectionately as “tuna fish.” So far so good.

1983 Nearly fail kindergarten because I refuse to learn the alphabet. My teacher refuses to explain
why I should learn it, opting instead for “I’m the teacher—that’s why.” I tell her that’s stupid and ask her
to leave me alone so I can focus on drawing sharks. She sends me to the “bad table” instead and makes
me eat a bar of soap. Disdain for authority begins.

1991 My first job. Ah, the memories. I’m hired for minimum wage as the cleaner at an ice cream
