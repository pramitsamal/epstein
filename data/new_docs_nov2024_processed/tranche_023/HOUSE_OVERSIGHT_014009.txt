Question and Answer (Preferences)

1. How do you feel about joint ventures?

I’m open to them, but my brand and respectability is #1. I will not do anything with anyone who
comes off as deceptive or amateur. “Make millions while you sleep in our super-insane foreclosure
program!” on the website disqualifies someone. I cannot be associated with anyone who might be
seen as a liar or snake-oil salesman. Just ask yourself: If the CEO of a well-known company saw
this, would he lose interest in speaking with me? If so, it won’t work.

For those who pass that criteria, what have they done already? I’m not looking for first-timers,
generally, unless they have an excellent track record and reputation elsewhere.

2. Do you focus solely on profit- generating tasks?

No. I also look for prestige (Harvard, government, etc.), wide exposure, as well as building
networks with people who have world-class skills in some area.

3. | How do you handle spam?
SpamArrest and Gmail. I have no problem with spam at this point.

4. What is your optimal response rate (i.e., respond to all e-mails no later than 48-72 hours after
received)?

Same day. I’m bringing you on to respond quickly.
5. Do you respond to any e-mails?

Yes, but P’Il want you to filter them first, respond to all you can, then mark the ones I should look
