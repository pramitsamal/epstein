Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI) C-2-9, Neutral
Upbeat on business outlook: TCBI’s President & CEO Keith Cargill, CFO & COO

Peter Bartholow, CAO Julie Anderson, and CLO Vince Ackerson were relatively
upbeat about TCBI’s business outlook. Management expects its mortgage
businesses, particularly MCA to be to be a source of strength even if overall
mortgage volumes were to slow down due to the rise in interest rates. Management
expects to mitigate the negative impact from lower mortgage activity by picking up
greater wallet share of existing clients and given the option to bring back to the
balance sheet loan participations. Regarding expenses, despite expectations for an
uptick in the efficiency ratio over the next couple of quarters management expects
to beat its 2016 efficiency guidance (low-to-mid 50s).

= Credit provisioning likely to trend lower In 2017: During an investor poll, nearly
half of investors expect credit provisions to be lower in 2017 vs. 2016, based on
expectations for stabilization in oil prices. Management expressed comfort that
reserve levels should be adequate even if oil prices were to decline to the mid-to-
high $30s in the near term (vs. spot WTI prices of $45/bbl today). However,
management would need to consider increasing its reserve level if oil falls to the
high $20s. Conversely, if oil stabilizes in the high $50s-low S60 levels, management
could consider reserve releases. Management stressed on looking at the forward
curve when assessing the impact from oil prices on credit costs vs. the spot rate.
