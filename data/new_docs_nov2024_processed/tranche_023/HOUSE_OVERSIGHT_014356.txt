likely. Mr. Gray also thinks that concerns over the commercial real estate market
may be overdone.

e Mr. Gray thinks the economic narrative has changed for the U.S., from low growth
and low interest rates to a more pro-growth outlook. There will likely be lower
taxes, less regulation, and more fiscal spending. A potential offset is that deficits
from government spending and tariffs could create inflation. Even so, management
was Cautiously optimistic on growth.

¢ For Europe, Brexit was the big news and Mr. Gray expects the next couple of years
will be somewhat challenging for the U.K, though the bigger question is core
Europe, where rates and inflation are likely to be lower for longer. In Asia, China is
decelerating, particularly for manufacturing, infrastructure, and real estate which
will likely continue though don’t expect a hard landing in China. A trade war
between the U.S. and China could be a risk to the downside for China. In India, BX
sees accelerating economic growth and falling inflation and interest rates, along
with a lot of demand for office space in India.

« Mr. Gray does not believe we are in the early stages of the real estate cycle, but
concern over a bubble in commercial real estate in the U.S. is probably overdone for
a couple of reasons. 1} Supply and demand are reasonable, given modest growth in
supply and an economy that is growing. 2) Debt levels aren’t out of hand like in
‘06/07. 3) Cap rates are low at around 5%, compared to ‘O7 when 10yr treasuries
were at the same level. Overall, you aren’t going to see the same returns as in the
past, but looking at past periods where rates and growth increased, commercial real
estate did fine.

« In terms of growth, Mr. Gray is optimistic on the outlook. Half of the areas BX
invests in today didn’t exist at the time of the IPO, and that culture of innovation,
growth, and investing for attractive returns is alive and well.
