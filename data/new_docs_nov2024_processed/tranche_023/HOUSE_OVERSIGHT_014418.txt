demand. Our US economics team expects the stimulus to boost growth in H2 CY17 and
likely CY18. Japan should be a big winner from stronger US growth, given its high
exposure to the US economy in terms of exports and corporate profits (Chart 22 and
Chart 23). On the negative side, aggressive protectionist trade measures, if
implemented, would depress US growth and global trade further. If combined with a
stronger yen, Japan’s economy would be hit hard.

Base case: “benign Trump” scenario

For the moment, we are assuming limited positive and negative policy changes. Our US
team expects uncertainty to cause a modest slowing of growth in the first half of next
year, but this will be more than offset by fiscal stimulus in the second half and into
2018. But the size of the fiscal expansion will likely be smaller than promised, and the
introduction of modest protectionist measures means that the boost to global trade will
essentially be zero. Table 1 shows the impact on growth under two scenarios, based on
different assumptions for global trade and FX. Under the upside case, Japan’s GDP could
rebound towards 2%, as the economy benefits from a combination of stronger global
trade and a weak currency. Under a downside “protectionist” scenario, 2017 growth
would slow to around zero and would most likely tip Japan back into deflation.

Political impact of a Trump administration
For Japan, the impact of Trump’s election goes beyond economic issues. It also impacts
defense spending and regional trade arrangements.

Military self-reliance and budget choices

Trump has made it clear that he wants allies of the US to shoulder a greater share of
the defense burden. There is a lot of uncertainty as to how far Trump will go to re-
define the US-Japan alliance. Despite his criticism, Japan already pays about 75% of US
military hosting costs. However, it seems fair to assume that Japan will be expected to
