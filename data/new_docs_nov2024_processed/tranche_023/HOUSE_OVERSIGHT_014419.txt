increase its defense spending. Under Prime Minister Abe, the defense budget has
expanded by 7% but has been kept at roughly 1% of GDP, in keeping with historical
guidelines. This is small by international standards and more likely than not will rise in
the coming years (Chart 24}. The composition of spending is also likely to shift from
operating costs towards procurement, which is currently a very small part of the budget
(Chart 25).

TPP and trade policy: potential for linkages with other regional players

Trump and his aides have made it clear that they consider the Trans Pacific Partnership
(TPP) to be a “bad deal.” Media have reported that President Obama is not considering
pushing the deal through a lame duck Congress. This means the deal is likely dead in its
current form.

While negative for Japan, the expected withdrawal of the US from TPP could spur new
arrangements with regional partners. One potential positive is the prospect of improved
economic and trade linkages with other key players in the region, including Russia and
even China. Three upcoming events are worth monitoring closely (Table 2): first, the 19-
20 November APEC Summit in Lima, Peru, where we are likely to see vigorous
discussions on the future of the TPP as well as further progress on the Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP); second, the 15 December Abe-Putin
Summit, in Yamaguchi prefecture; and third a potential trilateral summit between Japan,
China, and Korea, which onshore media now say is being scheduled for 19-20 December,
though it may not happen given the unfolding leadership upheaval in Korea.

Bullish bottom line - don’t underestimate the recovery

We are optimistic on Japan and think the acceleration in GDP and inflation in 2017 will
be much stronger than consensus expects. For the first time since 2013, fiscal and
monetary policy will be lined up in the same expansionary direction. The global export
cycle has turned and is now tracking modest expansion. Meanwhile, the headwinds to
domestic demand are finally turning into tailwinds. Unlike in the past, we think the risks
of a policy error are low. Assuming that external risks are kept at bay, we think Japan will
surprise with the strength of its recovery.
