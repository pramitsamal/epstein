JPY sellers > JPY buyers

While uncertainty is high, what is more certain is that there are more potential sellers of
JPY than its buyers. This is the opposite of the situation some months ago (USD/JPY’s
downside risk to 110 — sell on rally 10 February 2016). First, CFTC speculative position
remains yen long though short-term traders are probably positioned for the upside
already (Chart 3). Second, we believe domestic activity to raise hedge ratio has run its
course as the USD/JPY swept through the sensitive level this year. As 2HFY16 (Oct ‘16-
Mar ‘17} has started, most life insurance companies are reportedly inclined to increase
exposure to unhedged foreign bonds though they generally remain price sensitive. In our
view, this is reflected in the USD/JPY’s consolidation during Tokyo trading hours after
the pair hit 100 on the Brexit vote (Chart 4). The fact that USD/JPY has failed to break
100 multiple times since then suggests the market looking for USD/JPY’s dip, light
positioning, and the market’s judgment that USD should be more expensive than 100
JPY. The market is probably more vulnerable to the USD/JPY’s upside than downside.
