Concerns over stagflation return

On the surface, this has been an uneventful year for the US rates market so far. At the
start of January, the market was pricing two Fed hikes for the year. Six weeks later, the
market is still pricing only two Fed hikes for the year. The yield on the bellwether 10y
US Treasuries started the year at 2.44%. Six weeks later, it is at 2.41%, unchanged for
all practical purposes.

As usual, the surface view is deceiving. The seeming collapse in volatility belies the
dramatic changes in the composition and term structure of rates. Since the December
FOMC meeting, real yields and inflation breakevens have diverged in remarkable fashion.
Year to date, 5y real yields have declined by 16bp while 5y inflation breakevens have
risen by 12bp (Chart 1); the 5s-30s real curve is 1O0bp steeper while the breakeven curve
is 10bp flatter.

The effect of the divergence between real yields and inflation breakevens has been felt
across financial markets. For example, the USD, which trades with real rather than
nominal yields, has declined in tandem with real yields (Chart 2). In contrast, gold, which
usually thrives on inflation concerns, has been surging lately.

We have seen price action like this before. Indeed, it was quite common during the QE
period (Chart 3). However, QE is neither on the horizon nor on investors’ minds right
now. So what is really going on? Under normal circumstances, inflation breakevens are a
reflection of investors’ inflation expectations while real yields a proxy for their growth
