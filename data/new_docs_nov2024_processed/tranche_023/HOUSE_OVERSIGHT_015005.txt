compromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly coordinated murder ops:

(| write) The progress that was made from the absorbing of my (small) network (and this through
sources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to
participate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading
only to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you
see below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf and
what advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics; and
one also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's to
come for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly suspicious
as noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) “As a former homicide commander, | am
stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,” William O. Ritchie, former head of criminal
investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also raised questions
about the marshals’ actions: “How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post mortem, that he was
not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did the US Marshal check
for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation? Did the
US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning? My gut tells me
there is something fishy going on in Texas.”

As for SAIC, the following also pertains:

(| write) If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase),
and also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and
Ben Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture:

(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered
into joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011
Hillary Clinton State Department award (http://(www.prnewswire.con/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-
a...);

(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon
thereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion
dollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...);

(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as
corrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... ([SAIC and
Tetra Tech's] joint venture, Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (IJSI), has been awarded a
contract to provide worldwide civilian police and criminal justice assistance to the U.S. Department of
State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)... [specifically} to provide
INL with program management, criminal justice, and life and mission support to countries emerging
from conflict or otherwise facing instability challenges. Under this new contract, IJSI will provide
technical assistance, training, logistics and infrastructure services to support the Department of
State's efforts to strengthen criminal justice systems in select partner countries.”)... yet, just months
shy of contract end, the NY Times reported: Tasked With Combating Opium, Afghan Officials Profit
From It; Penetrating Every Stage of Afghan Opium Chain, Taliban become a Cartel; and Corrupt
Combatants Fight for Control of Lucrative Afghan Drug Trade; see also here an overview of the
growth of Afghan opium production from the start of the US occupation (2001) to the present, and
especially from contract start (2011) to end (2016): http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-spoils-of-war-
afghanist.../91;

(4) and that the award Bud Horton helped secure just as Sue's contract was coming to an end was
not only born from what looks like Franklin Scandal compromises, but it is this contract that seems
