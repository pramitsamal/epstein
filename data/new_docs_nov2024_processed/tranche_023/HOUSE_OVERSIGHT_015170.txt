Y' know, Sarah, if we get elected, | was hoping that our little tryst in
Washington could happen again, perhaps this time in the Oval Office.

PALIN: Thanks but no thanks.

McCAIN: | remember you were so pregnant then.

PALIN: And | remember exactly what you said. “Let me baptize your
fetus with some maverick juice.” How romantic. But you were lucky | was
already pregnant, because it would not have happened otherwise, since, as
you know, I’ m against birth control. Raising children is performing a task
that is from God. And | believe that life begins before conception.

McCAIN: You and the Bush administration. They also consider birth
control to be a form of abortion. The Health and Human Services
Department is secretly trying to redefine contraception--the Pill, IUDs, you
name it—redefine as abortion. So this federal agency could eliminate
many state laws. Pharmacists could refuse to supply women with birth
control devices. Insurance companies wouldn’ t cover contraception. Rape
victims wouldn’ t have access to the morning-after pill. You have your
beliefs and | respect them, but I’ m trying to distance myself from George
Bush.

PALIN: Except for his speechwriters.
