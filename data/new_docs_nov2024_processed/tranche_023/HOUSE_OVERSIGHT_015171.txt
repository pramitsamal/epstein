acceptance speech at the convention. He’ s great. By the way, he asked
me to pass on a line to you for the stump speech when you’ re talking

PALIN: That will definitely get a good response. We need as many
applause lines as we can muster up. Maybe every sentence should get a

can then become president.

PALIN: Okay, | promise not to have you killed--unless you decide to
run for a second term. /They both chortle nervously.]
