outrageous sex scene.’ Paul actually uses Marilena’ s pussy as an echo
chamber!”

Now, in his regular voice, he is telling our workshop of the need to

“approach the body, not for sexual release, but for every single inch of
this body, the groundwork, the geography of pleasure. Can anybody name
one spot on your body that is not capable of receiving pleasure?”
Nobody can. Later, the entire audience, seated around the perimeter of
this extra-large room, is instructed to come stand in the center area and
face their partners. | start to slide out, but not inconspicuously enough.
Ramana Das, who knows me from a previous incarnation, calls out, “There
goes Paul Krassner. Are you afraid to participate?”

“I’m here as a journalist.”
“Ah, he can’ t participate because he’ s a journalist. See how
everybody has excuses.”

Suddenly I’ m saddled with a dose of New Age guilt, as though |
have aborted my inner child. Meanwhile, there’ s a lovely blonde who
doesn’ t have a partner, and now |’ m tempted to participate, but some
guy who’ s also without a partner links up with her. Unexpectedly, my
guilt changes to jealousy. Just a slight pang of jealousy, mind you, but a

terrible taboo in this particular world.
