Groucho was especially interested in the countercultural aspects of
LSD. | mentioned a couple of incidents that particularly tickled him, and his
eyes sparkled with delight. One was about how, on Haight Street, runaway
youngsters, refugees from their own families, had stood outside a special
tourist bus—guided by a driver “trained in sociological significance” --and
they held mirrors up to the cameras pointing at them from the windows,
so that the tourists would get photos of themselves trying to take photos.
The other was about the day that LSD became illegal. In San
Francisco, at precisely two o'clock in the afternoon, a cross-fertilization of
mass protest and tribal celebration had taken place, as several hundred
young people simultaneously swallowed tabs of acid while the police
stood by helplessly
“Internal possession wasn't against the law,” | explained to
Groucho.
“And they trusted their friends more than they trusted the
government,” he said. “I like that.”
We had a period of silence and a period of listening to music. | was
accustomed to playing rock’ n’ roll while tripping, but the record
collection at this house consisted entirely of classical music and Broadway

show albums. First, we listened to the “Bach Cantata No. 7.” m
