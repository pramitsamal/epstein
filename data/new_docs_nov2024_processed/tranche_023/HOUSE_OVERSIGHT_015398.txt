The Missing Episode of Seinfeld

[erry Seinfeld is onstage at a comedy club]

Jerry: Did God look down at Adam and Eve one day and say, “Oops,
| forgot something. Let there be erections.” So Adam got the first hard-
on in history. But God forgot to say when. And that’ s why men don’ t
always get an erection when they want one. Women don’ t know it, but
sometimes men have to actually pray for a hard-on. “Please, God, |’ Il be
sensitive to her needs, | promise, oh God, please, just make it hard...”

[Cut to George Costanza, having dinner with his parents. There is no
conversation, but George’ s father is smiling, then chortles out loud.]

George: What! What! What’ s so funny? Is it because lI’ m
becoming more like you every day?

George’ s father: Should | tell’ im? I’ m gonna tell’ im.

George’ s mother: No, don’ t tell’ im. It’ s private between you
and me. It’ s none of his beeswax.

George: C' mon, stop teasing me, | wanna know, whatever it is, |
wanna know, so c’ mon, tell me.

George’ s father: Okay, |’ m gonna tell ' im. |’ ve been taking
Viagra, George, and it really works. Your mother and | have been making

whoopee like it was going out of style.
