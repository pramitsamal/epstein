Elaine You' re in denial again—but you have to give me a couple of
pills. | would just /ove to put a Viagra into Jerry and Kramer’ s coffee.

George: Oh, really? | thought you had scruples, Elaine. Dosing
somebody is unethical, especially friends.

Elaine: Oh, didn’ t | tell you? | had my scruples removed with laser
surgery.

George: Seriously, Elaine, what about all the s/de effects of Viagra?

Flaine: Stop worrying, George. Hurry, let me just have two. Jerry and
Kramer will be here any minute.

[Cut to the Stand-up Comedy Award ceremonies. Jerry, Elaine
George and Kramer have been sitting at a table, drinking coffee. Suddenly
the table rises slightly.]

Jerry: Kramer, stop that, what are you doing?

George: Maybe he’ s holding a one-man séance.

Kramer: | can’ t get it down! Jerry, | can’ t get it down!

Elaine: Gosh, Kramer, you must have been thinking about sex, huh?

Kramer: No, | was thinking about my business plan. That’ s the only
thing that really arouses me. When I’ m with a babe, | just think about my

latest scheme and | get aroused. But | always let the babe take the credit.
