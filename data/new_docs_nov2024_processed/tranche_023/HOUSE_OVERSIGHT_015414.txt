“You’ re hilarious. If you ever apologize to a heckler again | will rape
you.” Louis C.K.: “Your show makes me laugh every time | watch it. And
you have pretty eyes” --except that he wrote it after watching Tosh on TV,
but before he learned about the Laugh Factory incident. Nevertheless, he
was excoriated and accused of being a “rape apologist.” But C.K. himself
is no stranger to sexual-assault jokes. Onstage, he has said that he’ s
against rape-- “unless you have a reason, like you wanna fuck someone

and they won’ t let you, in which case what other option do you have?”

Conversely, in an episode of his TV series, Lou/e, he reversed such
roles. After leaving a bar with an especially aggressive woman, Laurie
(played by Melissa Leo), that he had inadvertently met earlier, she
performs fellatio on him in her pickup truck, then insists that he in turn
perform cunnilingus on her. And he refuses. So, she attacks him physically
with unabashed viciousness, mounts him, and he gives in to her
demand. In other words, Laurie rapes Louie. No joke. To watch this scene
was positively jaw-dropping. It served as a reminder of how often
comedians--and their jaded audiences--find prison-rape jokes not only to
be funny, but also, as in the case of pedophile Jerry Sandusky, an act of
delayed justice resulting in laughter that morphs into applause. A VY. Post

headline about pedophile Subway pitchman: “Enjoy a foot long in jail.”
