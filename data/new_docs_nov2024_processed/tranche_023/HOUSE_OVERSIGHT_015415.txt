And “Don’ t drop the soap” even made its way to the animated Family

Guy.

Meanwhile, reacting to the Tosh tirade, Julie Burton, president of the
Women’ s Media Center, stated: “If free speech permits a comedian to
suggest a woman in his audience should be gang-raped, then it certainly
permits us to object, and to ask what message this sends to survivors or to
perpetuators. Tosh’ s comment was just one extreme example of pop
culture’ s dismissive treatment of sexualized violence, which desensitizes
audiences to enormous human suffering. Internet outcry is encouraging,

but popular media needs to push back too.”

And the original blogger posted another message:

“My friend and | wanted to thank everyone for there /s/c/ support
and for getting this story out there. We just wanted everyone to know
what Daniel Tosh had done and if you didn’ t agree then to stop
following him. My friend is surprised to have gotten any form of an
apology and doesn’ t wish to press any further charges against [him].”
What? Press charges? Rape is a crime. Rape jokes aren’ t. They are the risk
of free speech. The blog concluded, “She does plan on returning to
comedy shows in the future, but to see comedians that she’ s seen before

or to at least look up artists before going to their shows.”
