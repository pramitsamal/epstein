134 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

A Simple Poem

Rain
There are holes in the sky
Where the rain gets in
But they’re ever so small
That’s why the rain is thin.

Coming upon a poem by chance can be likened to the probability
of dealing a perfect bridge hand. Shuffle the deck thoroughly and then
deal four hands. What is the probability every player will have the ace
through king in a single suit? It’s about 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000 hands.
Because lots of people play a lot of bridge around the world, this outcome
has been reported quite a few times. The possibility appears within the
bounds of human experience. Fifty-two playing cards seems close to the
80 characters that make up this poem and 13 choices of cards is about the
same as the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet. Wouldn't we expect poems of
this complexity to crop up almost as often?

NO.
