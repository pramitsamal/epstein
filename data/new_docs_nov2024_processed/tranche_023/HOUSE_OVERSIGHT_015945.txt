not to be, certain of finding the proof, you would need to run a computer
long enough to calculate all the possible proofs up to the length of Wiles’
solution. Currently, a computer using every particle in the Universe
clocked at the Plank interval — the fastest conceivable computer running
at 10° operations per second — would take 10°” times the age of the
known Universe to do this. If someone tells you this is astronomically
unlikely they are making a huge understatement. A computer running
until the end-of-time would only scratch the surface.

The second flaw is even more damning. Even if the monkeys
succeeded in generating something interesting, something else needs to
spot this. If an algorithm stumbled upon a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem,
what would recognize it as such? There are no ways to systematically
analyze proofs. There are no mechanical methods that understand these.
