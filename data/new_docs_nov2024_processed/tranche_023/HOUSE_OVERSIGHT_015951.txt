computer. You could simply create a table of all the possible inputs and all
the possible outputs I would make and this would be a perfect facsimile
of me. A number of people have posed this as an argument to refute
Roger Penrose’s assertion that humans are capable of non-computable
thought.

But this analysis misses a key point. There is no way to calculate all
the contents of this table. My past could be tabulated. It is the history of
all the things I ever did, but my future cannot. I might yet discover some
great theorem that could not be computably generated. This would be
a part of my output which could not be generated by an algorithm or
any mechanical process. This forms a non-computational arrow of time;
we can write down the past, we cannot write out the future. If a creative
person such as Andrew Wiles could be simulated in advance, we would
have an automatic way to find a solution to Fermat’s Last Theorem. Since
this is not possible, it follows that creative people cannot be simulated.
This also means the Turing test is not passable by a machine. Humans
can create; machines cannot. That is the difference.

Will Computers Take over the World?

Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor and futurologist, has suggested
computers are getting exponentially faster and will soon reach such
immense power they became effectively infinitely powerful. They could
instantly answer any question posed and solve all our engineering
problems. He dubs this point ‘the singularity’: a point of near infinite
