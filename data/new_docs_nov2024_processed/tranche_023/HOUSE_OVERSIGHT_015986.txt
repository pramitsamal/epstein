“Creativity is allowing yourself to
make mistakes. Art is knowing
which ones to keep.”

Scott Adams

“Invention is 1% inspiration and
99% perspiration.”
Thomas Edison

“Creativity is just connecting
things. When you ask creative
people how they did something,
they feel a little guilty because
they didn't really do it, they
just saw something. It seemed
obvious to them after a while.
Thats because they were able to
connect experiences they've had
and synthesize new things.”

Steve Jobs
