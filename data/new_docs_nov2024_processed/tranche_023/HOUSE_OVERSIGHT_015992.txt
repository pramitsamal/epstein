Eureka

after this you get that Eureka moment - illumination or insight where
the creative idea bursts forth into your conscious awareness. The idea
must finally be verified. Many of our ideas will turn out to be mistakes,
but that’s part of creativity. In the nearly hundred years of investigation
since Wallas proposed this theorem, we have not moved much further
forward in understanding creativity.

Alan Turing described his thoughts on the science behind creativity
in a short piece he wrote about decision making:

“When making a decision of minor importance, I have always
found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital
matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the
decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere
within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life, we
should be governed, I think, by the deep inner needs of our nature.”
