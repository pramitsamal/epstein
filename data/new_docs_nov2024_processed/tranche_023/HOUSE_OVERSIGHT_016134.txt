Sales of PIF assets could help replenish fiscal reserves but not Fx reserves
Secondary sales of domestic assets could be a faster way than Initial Public Offerings
(IPOs) and privatizations for the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to raise its fiscal reserves at
SAMA, in our view. We look at this possibility to assess the potential for the MoF to use
it as an option to support its fiscal reserves at SAMA and prevent a debt build-up in
response to ongoing fiscal deficits.

If this were to take place, this could occur through holdings of the PIF rather than the
pension funds who are large institutional investors in the domestic equity market, in our
view. We calculate that the PIF could sell stakes worth around SAR200bn (US$53.6bn)
domestically through liquidating existing minority stakes and selling down majority
holdings while retaining control. If the PIF holdings are above 50%, we assume
arbitrarily that the holding is strategic, and thus calculate the current value of the stake
that the PIF (using the current stock price in the market) can sell down so it retains a
controlling 51% ownership share. If the PIF holdings are below 50%, we arbitrarily
assume that the holding is not strategic, and thus calculate the current value of the
stake that the PIF holds (using the current stock price in the market) as we assume it
could be fully liquidated.

The proceeds of sales domestically (without foreign participation) would increase
central government deposits at SAMA, decrease other domestic liabilities of SAMA but
keep Fx reserves unchanged. Because of the latter, because such large coordinated sales
could weigh on the market and as the PIF is targeted to become the largest SWF by
Saudi authorities, we doubt this is going to be a course policy-makers are likely to be
considering in the near term.
