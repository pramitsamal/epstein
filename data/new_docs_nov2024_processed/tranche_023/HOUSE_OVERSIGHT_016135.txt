Material fiscal consolidation would be necessary to narrow macro imbalances
There is no substitute for fiscal consolidation to maintain Fx policy unchanged. We map
out below paths for several macro variables depending on fiscal policy and oil prices,
with higher oil prices easing the adjustment requirement.

In a worst case scenario where US$25/bbl oil prices would persist for the next five
years, sustainability of the Saudi Fx policy rests on material fiscal consolidation, which
we believe is achievable based on the mix of revenue-raising and spending restraint
plans likely or announced to date. This would require a total 5-year cumulative
adjustment of SARSOObn (US$133bn; 20% of 2015 GDP or 4ppt of GDP annually) from
2016 onwards, which is close to what the NTP appears to be targeting in non-oil
revenue measures (US$100bn, excluding NTP costs). We think 75% of the adjustment
can take place through revenue-raising measures. The remainder of the adjustment
would need to take place through capex cuts and is similar in size to the capex
retrenchment of the 1980-90s. However, note that if one assumes that the 2015 budget
deficit will be revised higher to 18.9% of GDP, this adds a need for a further 4ppt of
GDP cumulative fiscal adjustment to maintain the same trajectory of Fx reserves.

An overhaul of fiscal policy will likely be required

In line with the 2016 budget announcement, we would expect tight budgets to be
passed. We expect a VAT with 5% yield to be implemented in 2018, alongside further
administered price adjustments for energy, water and electricity. Implementation of the
land tax is likely, but it is unclear whether the proceeds will be ring-fenced to be used
solely for housing projects. Using solely the recurring existing proceeds of the
December administered price adjustments and a VAT introduction, we still see a need
for further fiscal restraint in the order of 1ppt of non-oil GDP annually. The latter would
