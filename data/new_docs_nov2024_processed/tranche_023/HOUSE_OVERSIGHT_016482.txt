Re: Motion to Unseal Briefs (with Names of Victims Redacted) in People v. Epstein, N.Y.
Co. Index No. 30129/10 (Appellate Division No. 6081

Dear Sir or Madam:

We wnite on behalf of non-party movant NYP Holdings, Inc., publisher of the New York
Post (the “Post”), to withdraw the motion filed by the Post on December 21, 2018 seeking an
order to unseal the briefs submitted by the parties in the above-captioned appeal (with the names
of victims redacted). Pursuant to NYCRR § 1250.2, we write to inform the Court that the Post
hereby withdraws its pending motion without prejudice and expressly reserves the right to refile
the motion. See NYCRR § 1250.2(a) (“Withdrawal of Motion. A moving party may file a
written request to withdraw a motion at any time prior to its determination”).

The Post intends to refile its motion for an order unsealing the briefs (with appropriate
redactions), but has withdrawn its pending motion in response to an affidavit submitted by the
office of the Manhattan District Attomey on December 28, 2018. That affidavit asserts that the
Post was required, but failed, to provide notice of the unsealing motion to “prosecutor’s offices
in Florida” before proceeding with its motion. While the Post firmly believes that it satisfied its
obligations by serving the Manhattan District Attorney’s office with a copy of its unsealing
motion, it wishes to avoid and moot any dispute with the District Attorney’s office over whether
the notice requirements of the relevant statute were met. Accordingly, the Post will refile its
motion to unseal next week and, at that time, will serve its motion papers on the relevant Florida
prosecutors, as well as on the parties to the appeal.
