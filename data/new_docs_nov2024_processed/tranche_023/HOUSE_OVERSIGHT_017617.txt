poor fit. Although OLC’s memorandum characterizes Turner as excluding victims of uncharged conduct, 1°

the magistrate
judge adopted an inclusive reading of the statute precisely because of his reservations about the CVRA's legislative history and
plain language. The judge suggested that any person who self-identifies as [a victim] could be presumed to qualify for
protection under the CVRA as a preliminary matter. !°° In fact, the line quoted by the Department is lifted out of context. The
full sentence reads: While the offense charged against a defendant can [*79] serve as a basis for identifying a crime victim'
as defined in the CVRA, the class of victims with statutory rights may well be broader. !°7

Paletz and Skinner similarly provide scant support for the Department's position. In Skinner, a prison inmate attempted to bring
a pro se civil suit against another inmate for allegedly attacking him during incarceration. !°° In dismissing the suit in an
unpublished decision, the district court recognized that the Government had expressly declined to bring charges against the
other inmate and concluded that the CVRA did not create a mechanism to bring an action against Defendant directly. 1°? In
Paletz, that same inmate brought a similar pro se claim against another inmate, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the FBI, and the
U.S. Attorney General. !!° In a parallel, unpublished decision, the district court dismissed the suit, noting that the CVRA is
designed to give victims certain rights within the prosecutorial process against a criminal defendant. 11!

Because Skinner and Paletz involve (apparently frivolous) civil suits, they say nothing about the CVRA's reach in criminal
cases, and any language to that effect would be pure dicta. Moreover, the courts' terse analysis in both cases does not contain
any substantive discussion of whether CVRA rights apply in criminal cases before the filing of charges. Instead, the courts
simply cited to language from a Second Circuit decision that stated that the CVRA does not give victims any rights against
defendants until those defendants have been convicted !!* - a holding clearly limited to restitution, as many other CVRA rights
clearly apply before conviction. !!3 Reviewing these two cases in an extended, published opinion, the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of Texas noted that reading these two decisions as standing for the proposition that charges must be filed
for CVRA rights to attach appears inconsistent with the CVRA recognition of certain subsection (a) rights that apply during
investigation, before any charging instrument is filed. '!4 As a result, OLC [*80] vastly overstates its position when it asserts
