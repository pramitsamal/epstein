As in any case involving the loss of state secrets, uncontested facts remain in extremely short-
supply. The opinion-laden appellatives such as “patriot” and “traitor” that have tended to fill the
gap in the great divide do little to address the important mystery of how many thousands of state
secrets were taken from the United States. How did Snowden breach the supposedly formidable
defenses of the NSA? Did he have any assistance? How did he escape to Moscow? And what
was the final destination of the stolen documents? The purpose is to find answers to these
questions. For this endeavor, it is necessary to return to the crime scene: the NSA’s base in
Hawaii.
