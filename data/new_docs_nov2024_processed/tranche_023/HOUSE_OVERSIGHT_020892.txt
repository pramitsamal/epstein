Medicare: Complex Social Insurance Program

With Insufficient Funding

e Social Insurance Program — Created in 1965 to provide health insurance to the elderly (65+).

e Four Parts — A) Hospital Insurance (to cover inpatient expenses, introduced in 1965); B)
Medical Insurance (optional outpatient expenses, 1965); C) Medicare Advantage Plans
(private alternative to A&B, 1997) and D) Prescription Drug Coverage (enacted 2003).

e Funding Mechanism Varies

— Part A has dedicated funding via payroll taxes (2.9% of total payroll), though has been
running at an annual deficit since 2008 as related payments exceed taxes; Trust Fund is
expected to be depleted by 2017E, per Social Security Administration.

— Part B &D has no dedicated funding (75% of funding came from government allocation /
25% came from enrollees’ premium payments).

— Part C funding came Part A & Part B.

e Ever-Growing Expenses — $452 billion expenses in F2010, up 2x from 10 years ago

— Rising Healthcare Costs — Owing to aging population + unhealthy life styles + technology
advances.

— Moral Hazard — As a “free good,” Medicare reduced demand for private long-term
insurance’ while loopholes in the regulations + need-based benefit policies created
incentives to abuse the system.
