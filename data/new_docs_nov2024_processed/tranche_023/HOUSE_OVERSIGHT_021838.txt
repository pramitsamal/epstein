of engaging in criminal misconduct, the attorney needs
to do a thorough investigation; is that right?

A. Yeah, under the circumstances, sure. I
should say in light of the circumstances, obviously, you
know, different kinds of cases can have different
circumstances.

Q. Okay. Is one of the considerations that goes
into that how much -- whether there's time pressure to
get the pleading on file?

A. Sure. That would be one of the factors.

Q. And how much time the attorney has to
investigate the facts?

A. Yes. That would be one of the factors as
well.

Q. Okay. And so before making -- where an
attorney's client has no pressing need to get a pleading
on file immediately, and the pleading is going to
include serious allegations of misconduct by another
person, an ethical attorney will take the time needed to
do a full investigation; is that fair?

A. That's fair, and the converse of your
proposition is also fair. For example, if a client has
a pending discovery dispute in front of a judge that
could be ruled on any day, that would be an exigency

that would require pleadings to be filed more quickly
