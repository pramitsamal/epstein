a a Ana Obregon: 1982

-_ na Obregén was one of the world’s most beautiful women
OM and well on her way to becoming famous as such when
Be 4 she first met Jeffrey Epstein. For her, there would be film

roles—in the 1984 Bo Derek vehicle Bolero, Ana Obregén gives

the star a run for her money —and appearances on the covers of

Spanish Playboy and Spanish Vanity Fair.

As for fortune, Obregon had that already.

Ana’s father was a very wealthy investor in Spain. But he also
‘ had serious problems. On June 15, 1982, a venerable stock- and
: f bond-trading firm, the Drysdale Securities Corporation, announced
q that it was going out of business. Just that year, Drysdale had spun
r _ off a subsidiary operation called Drysdale Government Securities.
_ And in May, DGS defaulted on $160 million in interest payments it
4 q Owed on Treasury securities that it had borrowed. In doing so, DGS
} had dragged down its parent company.
