who was also employed at Mar-a-Lago as a maintenance man-
ager. But Virginia’s father saw nothing wrong with the offer, and
he drove her, later that day, to Epstein’s house on El Brillo Way.

There, according to the document, Maxwell assured Virgin-
ia’s father that Ms. Maxwell would provide transportation home
for his teenage daughter. Then she led Virginia upstairs, to a spa
room equipped with a shower and a massage table. Jeffrey
Epstein was lying, naked, on the table.

Virginia was shocked, she says in the filing, but, with no
experience with massages, thought this could be massage ther-
apy protocol. “Ms. Maxwell then took off her own shirt and left
on her underwear and started rubbing her breasts across
[Jeffrey’s] body, impliedly showing [Virginia] what she was
expected to do,” the filing continues. “Ms. Maxwell then told
[Virginia] to take off her clothes. The minor girl was apprehen-
sive about doing this, but, in fear, proceeded to follow Ms. Maxwell
by removing everything but her underwear. She was then ordered
to remove her underwear and straddle [Epstein]. The encounter
escalated, with [Jeffrey] and Ms. Maxwell sexually assaulting,
battering, exploiting, and abusing [Virginia] in various ways and
in various locations, including the steam room and the shower.
At the end of this sexually exploitive abuse, [Epstein] and
Ms. Maxwell giddily told [Virginia] to return the following day
and told her she had ‘lots of potential’ [Epstein] paid [Virginia]
hundreds of dollars, told her it was for two hours of work, and

_ directed one of her employees to drive her home.”

At the time, Virginia was fifteen years old.
