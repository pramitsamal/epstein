James PATTERSON

One young woman Ward talked to had been invited by Ghis-

laine Maxwell to attend a party at Epstein’s town house. There,
the woman had noticed, female guests far outnumbered the male
guests. “These were not women you'd see at Upper East Side din-
ners.” the woman had said. “Many seemed foreign and dressed a
little bizarrely.”

“This same guest also attended a cocktail party thrown by
Maxwell that Prince Andrew attended, which was filled, she
says, with young Russian models,” Ward wrote. “‘Some of the
guests were horrified? the woman says.”

Another source, one who had worked with Epstein, said,
“He’s reckless, and he’s gotten more SO. Money does that to you.
He’s breaking the oath he made to himself—that he would never
do anything that would expose him in the media. Right now, in
the wake of the publicity following his trip with Clinton, he

must be ina very difficult place.”
