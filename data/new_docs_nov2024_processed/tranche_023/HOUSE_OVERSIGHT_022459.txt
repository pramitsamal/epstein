“Thanks for sending along the new issue of Inference. Your journal has established a wonderful
editorial policy of presenting deeply thoughtful examinations of a broad range of scholarly
topics. Not only do I plan to keep up with Inference going forward, but also I will convey my
enthusiasm for your journal to those colleagues of mine who I think will be interested.”
