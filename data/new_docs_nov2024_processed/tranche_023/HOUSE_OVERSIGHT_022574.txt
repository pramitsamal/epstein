In civil cases, a company may similarly be required
to retain an independent compliance consultant or moni-
tor to provide an independent, third-party review of the
company’s internal controls. The consultant recommends
improvements, to the extent necessary, which the company
must adopt. When both DOJ and SEC require a com-
pany to retain a monitor, the two agencies have been able
to coordinate their requirements so that the company can
retain one monitor to fulfill both sets of requirements.

The most successful monitoring relationships are
those in which the company embraces the monitor or con-
sultant. If the company takes the recommendations and
suggestions seriously and uses the monitoring period as a
time to find and fix any outstanding compliance issues, the
company can emerge from the monitorship with a stronger,

long-lasting compliance program.
