Every issuer of a security registered pursuant to section 78] of this title
shall file with the Commission, in accordance with such rules and reg-
ulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate
for the proper protection of investors and to insure fair dealing in the

security—

(1) such information and documents (and such copies thereof) as the
Commission shall require to keep reasonably current the information
and documents required to be included in or filed with an applica-
tion or registration statement filed pursuant to section 78] of this title,
except that the Commission may not require the filing of any material

contract wholly executed before July 1, 1962.

by the rules and regulations of the Commission by independent pub-
lic accountants, and such quarterly reports (and such copies thereof),

as the Commission may prescribe.

Every issuer of a security registered on a national securities exchange

report, or other reports to be filed with the Commission, an emerging
growth company need not present selected financial data in accor-
dance with section 229.301 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations,
for any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in con-
nection with its first registration statement that became effective

et seq.| and, with respect to any such statement or reports, an emerg-

ing growth company may not be required to comply with any new

ant to this chapter, the form or forms in which the required informa-

sheet and the earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in
the preparation of reports, in the appraisal or valuation of assets and
liabilities, in the determination of depreciation and depletion, in the
differentiation of recurring and nonrecurring income, in the differen-
tiation of investment and operating income, and in the preparation,
where the Commission deems it necessary or desirable, of separate
and/or consolidated balance sheets or income accounts of any person
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any
person under direct or indirect common control with the issuer; but
in the case of the reports of any person whose methods of accounting
are prescribed under the provisions of any law of the United States,
or any rule or regulation thereunder, the rules and regulations of the
Commission with respect to reports shall not be inconsistent with
the requirements imposed by such law or rule or regulation in respect
of the same subject matter (except that such rules and regulations of

extent that the Commission determines that the public interest or the

protection of investors so requires).
