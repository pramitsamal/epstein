if such act in cooperation with such head of a department or agency
was done upon the specific, written directive of the head of such
department or agency pursuant to Presidential authority to issue such
directives. Each directive issued under this paragraph shall set forth
the specific facts and circumstances with respect to which the provi-
sions of this paragraph are to be invoked. Each such directive shall,
