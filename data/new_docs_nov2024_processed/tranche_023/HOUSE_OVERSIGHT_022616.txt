6 Although private companies are not covered by the books and records
and internal controls provisions of the FCPA and do not fall within
SEC’s jurisdiction, such companies generally are required by federal and
state tax laws and state corporation laws to maintain accurate books and
records sufficient to properly calculate taxes owed. Further, most large
private companies maintain their books and records to facilitate the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP to comply
with financial institutions’ lending requirements.

247 See SEC v. RAE Sys. Inc, supra note 92; In ve RAE Sys. Inc., supra note
92.

*48 See Section 13(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b) (6),
which provides that where an issuer “holds 50 per centum or less of the
voting power with respect toa domestic or foreign firm,’ the issuer must
“proceed in good. faith to use its influence, to the extent reasonable under
the issuer’s circumstances, to cause such domestic or foreign firm to devise
and maintain a system, of internal accounting controls consistent with
[Section 13(b)(2)],”

49 See 15 US.C. § 78m(b)(6). Congress added the language in sub-
section 78m(b)(6) to the FCPA in 1988, recognizing that “it is
unrealistic to expect a minority owner to exert a disproportionate degree
of influence over the accounting practices ofa subsidiary.” H.R. Rep.

No. 100-576, at 917. The Conference Report noted that, with respect

to minority owners, “the amount of influence which an issuer may
exercise necessarily varies from case to case. While the relative degree of
ownership is obviously one factor, other factors may also be important in
determining whether an issuer has demonstrated good-faith efforts to use
its influence.” Jd; see also S. Rep. No. 100-85, at 50.

*5° Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, titled “Prosecution of Persons
Who Aid and Abet Violations,’ explicitly provides that for purposes of

a civil action seeking injunctive relief or a civil penalty, “any person that
knowingly or recklessly provides substantial assistance to another person
in violation of a provision of this title, or of any rule or regulation issued
under this title, shall be deemed to be in violation of such provision to
the same extent as the person to whom such assistance is provided.” See
Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 US.C. § 78t(e).
