°8 Foreign officials may “not be charged with violating the FCPA itself,
since the [FCPA] does not criminalize the receipt ofa bribe by a foreign
official.” United States v. Blondek, 741 FSupp. 116, 117 (N.D. Tex.
1990), affd United States v. Castle, 925 F.2d 831 (Sth Cir. 1991) (“We
hold that foreign officials may not be prosecuted. under 18 U.S.C. §

37] for conspiring to violate the FCPA.’). Foreign officials, however,

can be charged with violating the FCPA when the foreign official acts
asan intermediary of a bribe payment. See, eg., Information, United
States v. Basu, No. 02-cr-475 (D.D.C. Nov. 26, 2002) (World Bank

286 For example, in United States v. BAE Systems ple, BAE pleaded guilty
to conspiring to defraud the United States by impairing and impeding its
lawful functions, to making false statements about its FCPA compliance
program, and to violating the AECA and ITAR. BAE paid a $400
million fine and agreed toan independent corporate monitor to ensure
compliance with applicable anti-corruption and export control laws.

on the same underlying facts as the criminal guilty plea, BAE entered

a civil settlement with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls for
violations of AECA and ITAR, including over 2500 ITAR violations
that included a failure to report the payment of fees or commissions
associated with defense transactions and failure to maintain records
involving ITAR-controlled transactions. BAE paid $79 million in
penalties, and the State Department imposed a “policy of denial” for
export licenses on three BAE subsidiaries involved in the wrongful
conduct. Consent Agreement between BAE Sys. ple and Defense Trade
