>> Scientists’ greatest pleasure comes from theories that derive the solution to some deep puzzle from a small
set of simple principles in a surprising way. These explanations are called beautiful or elegant. Historical
examples are Kepler's explanation of complex planetary motions as simple ellipses, Bohr's explanation of the
periodic table of the elements in terms of electron shells, and Watson and Crick's double helix. Einstein
famously said that he did not need experimental confirmation of his general theory of relativity because it was
so beautiful it had to be true.

the most reliable way of gaining knowledge about anything, including other fields of inquiry such as
philosophy, mathematics, economics, history, political theory, literary theory, or the human spirit. The only
requirement is that some simple and non-obvious idea explain some diverse and complicated set of phenomena.
