The storm in Syria

Amir Taheri

April 16, 2011 -- Yesterday was supposed to be the first day of what
Syrian despot Ba shar al-Assad had dubbed social calm; he hoped
his mixture of promises and repressive measures would silence the
pro-democracy uprising that has shaken the Ba'athist regime. Instead,
the opposition mounted a Friday of Resolution, with fresh
nationwide marches against tyranny.

In addition to other empty moves, Assad had ordered the release of
protesters arrested in the past four weeks provided they had not done
anything that might undermine the interests of the state and the
nation's security. Those qualifiers meant that by yesterday evening
only nine people had been set free, out of an estimated 1,200 arrested
in 18 cities -- and scores more were arrested yesterday.

To be sure, the opposition didn't succeed in organizing a major march
in the capital. But a crowd of no more than 600 marched from
Damascus to the nearby town of Douma, where security forces have
killed at least 30 demonstrators in the past two weeks.

Yesterday was a success for the opposition. It managed to defy the
massive security buildup to hold demonstrations in at least 20 cities,
underlining its nationwide appeal. It also managed to show its
presence in Aleppo, the country's second most populous city, which
had remained relatively quiet until now.

Also significant were the first demonstrations in the Druze areas,
which had never before shown any sign of revolt against the Assad
dynasty. Yesterday, Syria's biggest Druze city, Suwaidah, became an
Assad-free zone as portraits of the despot and his father were
burned in public.
