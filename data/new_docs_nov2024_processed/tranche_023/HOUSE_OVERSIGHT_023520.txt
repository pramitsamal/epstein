strongest economy and military, complete with an arsenal of nuclear
weapons. The chief threats to Israel are from new technologies —
rockets, biological weapons — and demography. Its physical
existence is less in doubt than its democratic existence as it continues
to rule millions of Palestinians in serf-like conditions — entitled to
neither a vote nor a country.

The path to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been clear
for 20 years. Israel would cede most of the land it conquered in the
1967 war to a Palestinian state, keeping the major settlement blocks.
In return, it would get a series of measures designed to protect its
security. That’s why the process is called land for peace. The problem
is that Netanyahu has never believed in land for peace. His strategy
has been to put up obstacles, create confusion and wait it out. But one
day there will be peace, along the lines that people have talked about
for 20 years. And Netanyahu will be remembered only as a person
before the person who made peace, a comma in history.
