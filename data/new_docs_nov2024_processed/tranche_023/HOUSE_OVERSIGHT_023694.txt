CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN HOST: Good evening.
I'm Christiane Amanpour. There may officially be only one
superpower today, but another is rapidly advancing. The
United States and China jockey for position at the pinnacle of
the world in what might just be called a race to the top. So
how will the first tete-a-tete go between their leaders, the two
most powerful men on Earth, U.S. President Barack Obama
and China's leader, Xi Jinping, will meet just over a week
from now in an informal setting at the aptly named
Sunnylands Estate just outside Los Angeles. China is
anxious and angry about Obama's much-touted “pivot” to
Asia and about what China perceives to be the U.S. siding
with Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea. The
United States, for its part, has a laundry list of concerns,
everything from alleged Chinese hacking of even its most
sensitive military secrets to its influence over North Korea
and Pyongyang's nuclear saber-rattling. President Xi says the
U.S.-China relationship 1s at a crucial juncture and he says
that he wants to forge, a new type of great power
relationship. So what exactly will that look like? We need
to know because this may just be the most important
relationship in the world today. And in a moment, I will dig
deeper with Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a long-time adviser to
China's leaders.

AMANPOUR: Robert Lawrence Kuhn has tremendous
insight into China's leaders. He's a long-time adviser to the
Chinese government; he's met President X1 several times and
he's the author of the book, How China's Leaders Think.
That is a big title. Welcome to the studio.
