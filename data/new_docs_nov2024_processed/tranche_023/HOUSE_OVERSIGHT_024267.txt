Day 7: Free vs. Proprietary Code and Content

This day examines quite different models for the development and distribution of software --
which can also serve as models for hardware, and for content. What kind of ecosystem,
featuring what models, is desirable?

We will think about current issues in cybersecurity as a case study in why free vs. proprietary
code might matter, and take up the question of how regulation might be applied when there are
no easily identified intermediaries in the production of code.

And we will hear from the legendary David Clark, one of the framers of the Internet.
