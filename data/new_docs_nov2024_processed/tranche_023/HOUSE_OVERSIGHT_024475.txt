5. SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA

The following summary historical pro forma and projected financial data should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of KLC’s Pro Forma Results of
Operations” presented elsewhere in this Memorandum. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”
elsewhere in this Memorandum for a discussion of the derivation and limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR. The historical information is pro forma for the effects of our acquisition
of KinderCare in January 2005 and for the separation of our business into operating (KLC OpCo) and
property (KLC PropCo) in November 2005, as if those transactions and related financing had occurred on
January 1, 2004. The rental income received by KLC PropCo in all periods presented is primarily
comprised of lease payments from KLC OpCo.

Our pro forma results for KLC were not prepared in conformity with Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the
SEC (which would not, among other limitations, permit a 2004 pro forma presentation after completion of
our 2005 financial statements). In addition, by presenting a pro forma comparison, this section does not
include a comparison of KLC’s historical GAAP consolidated operating results or segment information that
would be required by Item 3-03 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. In addition, the non-GAAP financial
information presented below does not comply with Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or Regulation G of the
SEC. For further information, please see KLC's GAAP financial statements and those of KinderCare
included in this Memorandum.

The pro forma presentation below is not shown with adjustments to historical financial statements.
Instead, it is based on a “ground up” combination of corporate level expenditures (overhead and capital
expenditures) and internal financial statements derived from a center-by-center build up of KLC’s results.
The primary reasons for the presentation based on internal reports are different fiscal year ends and
expense classification between KLC and KinderCare.

Projected results presented below are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but
which are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. For a discussion of the assumptions, see “The
Operating Company (KLC OpCo) — Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion” and “The
Real Estate Company (KLC PropCo) — Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion.” Our
ability to perform as projected depends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty
and our performance could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in
“Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Memorandum. See also “Forward-Looking Statements.”
