support other parallel solutions, including
the political one. But FSA [has] become a
jungle. ... My recommendation is... to
start working on elite [forces that can]...
initiate key attacks plus help as a buffer
from potential warlords and fights among
fragmented FSA factions. Plus, this unit
can handle other key tasks, like securing
chemical weapons.”

This Syrian strategist argues in another
memo that the rebels must “speak to the
silent majority, many who did not care
about the revolution, and they want their
life back.” He said that such a negotiated
settlement requires more pressure on the
United States, Russia and the United
Nations “to find a way out of the
deadlock.”
