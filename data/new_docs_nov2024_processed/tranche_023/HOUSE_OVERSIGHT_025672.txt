 New blockchain-related projects are funded via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). This process raises capital through token sales.

 In an ICO, the object offered is either a new digital coin or a yet-undeveloped concept in search of funding. ICO investors
purchase an ownership percentage of a future money supply or functionality.

# While many ICOs support legitimate use cases, Autonomous Research asserts, “unfortunately, many ICOs are fraudulent. ””!

 Rather than raising fiat currency, ICOs primarily raise capital in the form of Bitcoin and Ether, driving additional demand for
the cryptocurrencies.
