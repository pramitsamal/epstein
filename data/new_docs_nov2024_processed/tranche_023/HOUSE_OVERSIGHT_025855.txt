Resolving
Disputes

GIS’s mediation services to resolve Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) disputes, as mandated by Congress, comprised the bulk
of OGIS’s work in FY 2013, as in the previous three years. Requests for
assistance awaited Director Nisbet when she opened the Office, and early
on, OGIS decided that demand for mediation services dictated that the
Office commit to assisting
anyone asking for help with
FOIA.
From the start, OGIS has

served as a confidential and

informal information resource,
communications channel,
complaint handler, and dispute
resolver. OGIS strives to be an
advocate not for the requester or
the agency, but for an effective
FOIA process that works as ; a
intended. ‘

In its first three years, OGIS
handled an average of roughly
350 cases a year. The number

of requesters seeking OGIS

OGIS’s caseload soared above 500 for the
first time in FY 2013. (NARA Identifier
