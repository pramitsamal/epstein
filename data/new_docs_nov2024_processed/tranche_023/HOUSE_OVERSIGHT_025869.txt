2. REITERATING THE IMPORTANCE OF FOIA

OGIS routinely encourages all Federal agencies to remind their staff
members of the importance of FOIA and that FOIA is everyone's
responsibility. During Sunshine Week 2013, Archivist of the United

States, David Ferriero, sent such a message to NARA staff. Other agencies,
including the Departments of Energy and Transportation, sent similar
messages throughout the year. OGIS continues to encourage all agencies
to remind their staffs of the importance of FOIA and offers the Archivist’s

message as a model.

3. EXAMINATION OF FOIA FEES

OGIS continues to observe that fees and fee waivers remain a persistent point
of contention administratively and in litigation. OGIS began examining FOIA
fee issues by reviewing its own fee-related cases over the past four years and
identifying common themes. OGIS intends to continue this project in FY 2014

by working with stakeholders from both inside and outside government to

discuss fee issues.

4. IMMIGRATION RECORDS AND FOIA

Over the past four years, OGIS has observed a large increase in our cases related
to requests for immigration-related records from individuals who are not USS.
citizens or lawful permanent residents. OGIS began communicating with agency
officials who receive these types of requests, as well as with some of the requester
organizations and representatives who file them. OGIS continues to work with
agencies to streamline the process and to identify issues related to first-party
immigration-related records requests that will inform OGIS stakeholders as well

as Congress and the President.
