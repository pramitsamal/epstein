Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was
capable of having her whole family killed. Exhs. A and B.

24. The duress had prevented Plaintiff from starting litigation before this year.
However, as soon as she surfaced, she received threats. More specifically, shortly after her first
complaint was filed in California on April 26, 2016, she started receiving threatening phone calls
on her cell phone. Exh. A.

2s Defendants are equitably estopped from arguing that any statute of limitations has
not been tolled as Defendants wrongfully forced Plaintiff to refrain from timely commencing this
action by threats, duress, and other misconduct. Exhs. A and B.

26. Moreover, this action has been brought before the facts giving rise to the estoppel
have ceased to be operational (i.e., while still under threats of physical harm by coming forward
and having no reason to believe that the threats have ever been lifted or would ever be lifted) and
since Plaintiff has decided to seek redress at this time, Plaintiff seeks an order of protection in
favor of Plaintiff and all associated with her so as to protect them from harm and harassment

from Defendants and their agents and associates. Exh. A.
