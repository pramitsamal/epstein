‘Shady’ Israeli Mogul Hires Ex-White House Counsel To Represent Employee Arrested in Inauguration Day
Riot, Raising Questions<http://heatst.com/politics/shady-israeli-mo gul-hires-ex-white-house-counsel-to-

The mystery surrounding a would-be media magnate — who owns surveillance and security firms working for
repressive regimes — is growing.

The questions about Matania (Mati) Kochavi were sparked again this weekend when Kathryn Ruemmler, who
until recently was President Obama’s White House Counsel, showed up on Saturday morning in local
Washington DC court to represent one of the 217 people arrested for rioting on Inauguration Day.

Ms. Ruemmler said she was there to represent a journalist, on assignment for the media company
Vocativ<http://www.vocativ.com/>, who’d gotten swept up with the protesters in the arrests.

Vocativ is owned by Kochavi. Reporters at the courthouse asked why a big gun like Ruemmler, who has long
been a specialist in corporate crime, would show up for what would seem to be a misunderstanding involving a
journalist doing his job.

Ms. Ruemmler told Buzzfeed that Vocativ is a client of her
firm,<https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/prosecutors-pursue-rioting-charges-over-inaueguration-day-
pro?utm_term=.gtPej4zon#.cgvzaBvG2> Latham & Watkins. The firm is one of the most prestigious law shops
in New York and Washington with partners such as Ruemmler<https://www.lw.com/people/kathrynruemmler>
charging thousands of dollars an hour.

She did look somewhat out of place among the lawyers there to defend anarchists and other alleged
troublemakers who are charged with rioting, burning a limo and smashing up stores on the streets of the capital.
“The individuals charged were generally brought in front of the judge in groups of 10 and were represented by a
cadre of public defenders and other court-appointed lawyers,” according to Buzzfeed. That was not the case
when it came to Vocativ.

Based in New York and Tel Aviv, Vocativ publishes mostly reprints of health studies, aggregated videos for
Facebook, and female focused feature pieces. The company which employs a large team of US journalists and
ex-Israeli intelligence operatives, claims to use technology from the intelligence world to source its stories.
Indeed its founder, Kochavi, has a background in Israeli intelligence, having made his fortune providing
security and military grade public safety solutions to the superrich Emirate of Abu Dhabi through an entity
called AGT.
