Sample and methodology

The fieldwork for this study was conducted by

NMG's strategy consulting practice. Invesco chose

to engage a specialist independent firm to ensure

high-quality objective results. Key components of

the methodology included:

- A focus on the key decision makers within sovereign
investors and central banks, conducting interviews
using experienced consultants and offering market
insights rather than financial incentives

- In-depth (typically one-hour) face-to-face interviews
using a structured questionnaire to ensure
quantitative as well as qualitative analytics were
collected

- Analysis capturing investment preferences as well
as actual investment allocations with a bias toward
actual allocations over stated preferences

- Results interpreted by NMG's strategy team with
relevant consulting experience in the global asset
management sector

In 2017 we conducted interviews with 97 funds:

62 sovereign investors (compared to 59 in 2016)

and 35 central bank reserve managers (18 in 2016).

The 2017 sovereign investor sample is split into three

core segmentation parameters (sovereign investor

profile, region and size of assets under management)
in figures 36 to 38. The 2017 central bank sample is

broken down by segment in figure 39.
