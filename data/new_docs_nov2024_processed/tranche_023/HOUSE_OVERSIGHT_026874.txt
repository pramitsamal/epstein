RLK: The trade deficit has a lot of
things in there that are not
accurate. You look at the iPhone,
China will get 6, 10 percent of
that, the rest are components that
go into China. Services are 40
billion dollars — what Chinese
tourists and students pay in the
US — not counted in the trade
deficit, which is a very
complicated number. It also
benefits the US because we have a
lot of good products at cheaper
prices.

RLK: But there are five real
reasons that are problematic to
the US with respect to China:
closed markets; intellectual
property protection; industrial
espionage, which includes cyber
theft; forced technology transfer
in JVs; and government support
for future industries. Those are
five real issues that the smart
people in America are focusing on.
And legitimately so.
