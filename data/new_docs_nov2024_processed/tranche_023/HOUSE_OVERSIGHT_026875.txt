RLK: But there are five real
reasons that are problematic to
the US with respect to China:
closed markets; intellectual
property protection; industrial
espionage, which includes cyber
theft; forced technology transfer
in JVs; and government support
for future industries. Those are
five real issues that the smart
people in America are focusing on.
And legitimately so.

RLK: But these are, I believe,
solvable — because intellectual
property rights, China's
improving. Industrial espionage,
they're reducing and they have
reduced. It needs to be more.
Tech transfer, I think that will be
eliminated.

RLK: The two critical issues are
government support of nascent
industries in China and the
opening of markets. I think
ultimately those two can be
traded. The US can recognize that
China can do some of those things
with certain restrictions and really
open their markets more. I think
that's the ultimate trade.
