by Rosenstein in mid-May 2017, during the chaotic days between Comeya€™s firing and
Rosensteind€™s decision to appoint Mueller. The Times claimed that, in meetings with
top FBI and Justice Department officials, Rosenstein made two eyebrow-raising

the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. (Neither was carried
out.),textStyle: anf-cts-1,type:text}, {identifier: anf-body-
