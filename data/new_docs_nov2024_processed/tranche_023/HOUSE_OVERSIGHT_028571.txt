BREYER, J., dissenting

1502.

Some of these organizations, including the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), themselves believe they do not
need broad immunity in commercial areas, and they have
waived it. See, e.g., Articles of Agreement of the Interna-
tional Finance Corporation, Art. 6, §8, Dec. 5, 1955, 7
U.S. T. 2214, 264 U. N. T. 8S. 118 Gmplemented by 22
U.S. C. §282g); see also 860 F. 3d 708, 706 (CADC 2017).
But today’s decision will affect them nonetheless. That is
because courts have long interpreted their waivers in a
manner that protects their core objectives. See, e.g.,
Mendaro v. World Bank, 717 F. 2d 610, 614-615 (CADC
1983). (This very case provides a good example. The D. C.
Circuit held below that the IFC’s waiver provision does not
cover petitioners’ claims because they “threaten the
[IFC’s] policy discretion.” See 860 F. 3d, at 708.) But
today’s decision exposes these organizations to potential
liability in all cases arising from their commercial activi-
ties, without regard to the scope of their waivers.

Under the majority’s interpretation, that broad exposure
to liability is at least a reasonable possibility. And that
being so, the interpretation undercuts Congress’ original
objectives and the expectations that it had when it enacted
the Immunities Act in 1945.

The majority’s opinion will have a further important
consequence—one that more clearly contradicts the stat-
ute’s objectives and overall scheme. It concerns the im-
portant goal of weeding out lawsuits that are likely bad or
harmful—those likely to produce rules of law that inter-
fere with an international organization’s public interest
tasks.

To understand its importance, consider again that in-
ternational organizations, unlike foreign nations, are
multilateral, with members from many different nations.
