All I can say about Bill’s message on Monday is: “Amen, brother! Amen!”

He hit every nail right on the head.

To those self-deluding worthies who think that a Donald Trump
presidency will solve all of America’s problems I say, “Get your heads

out of your collective a***s, because it ain’t gonna happen.”

Trump will continue the policies (if we can laughably call them such) of
the Deep State... with a dash of Adolph Hitler thrown in for good

measure. Clinton will be no better, if not worse.

I’m with Bill — a vote for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil.
However, unlike him, I will vote, but for a third-party candidate who
doesn’t have a snowball’s chance of winning. A “wasted” vote is better

than a vote for Trump or Hillary.

— Dale A.

I think you are correct in your assessment of the Deep State. I disagree

in how to deal with it.

It seems easy for the rich or the poor to walk away and state it doesn’t
matter. The poor because they do not have a choice; the rich because
they do. For those of us in the middle we need to deal with it, lest we
end up in the poor camp. For me, a decision that includes a less bad

scenario is still a decision worth pursuing.

— Rudy R.

In Case You Missed It...

The third part of Doug Casey’s “virtual workshop” on how to turn crises into

wildly profitable investments goes live today.
