Expectations
Forecast

Weare projecting sales of $400,000 in Year 1, $850,000 in Year 2, and $1.6 million in Year
3 with a profit margin of 100%. This assumes we are serving around 20 customers in
Year 1. Our co-founders will not draw any salary in the first 2 years so that we can
reinvest our profits into growing the business. PR/Marketing and staff working on the
product and business development will be our largest expense.
