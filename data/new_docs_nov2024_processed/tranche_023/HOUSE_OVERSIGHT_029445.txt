e Charitable gifts. A charitable contribution deduction is limited to a certain percentage of the
individual’s adjusted gross income (AGI), and this limitation varies depending on the type of property
contributed and the type of exempt organization receiving the property. Under 2017 law, cash
contributed to public charities, private operating foundations, and certain non-operating private
foundations generally could be deducted up to 50% of the donor’s AGI. Under the Act, this 50%
limitation is increased to 60%. The provision retains the 5-year carryover period to the extent that the
contribution amount exceeds 60% of the donor’s AGI.

e Investment expenses and investment interest. Under 2017 law, investment expenses were
deductible as a “miscellaneous itemized deduction” if, and to the extent, they exceed 2% of AGI. The
Act repeals the deduction for “miscellaneous itemized deductions” that are subject to the 2% AGI
limitation, such as investment management expenses. Under 2017 law and current law, investment
interest is not a “miscellaneous itemized deduction.” Therefore, the deduction for investment interest
remains untouched and continues to be deductible to the extent of investment income.

CONCLUSION
Given the significant tax changes in 2018, planning will be a challenge. It is important to understand the

implications that the Act can have on your particular tax situation.
