Business Expansion Portfolio and Prospectus
Twin City Care of The Virgin Islands
12

Competition

Presently, there is no competition for Twin City. All non-emergency ambulance and non-medial
stretchers are regulated through the Virgin Islands Department of Health and Wheel Coach
Services that are currently the only provider of the non-medical stretcher. Since 2003 to this date
Wheel Coach is unable to provide non-emergency ambulance service on the island of St. Croix. It
is very feasible to conduct successful non-emergency ambulance operations with the local
hospitals (JFLH), fee for service (Medicare, Medicaid, Private Insurance, self-pay).

Positioning

It is the goal of Twin City Care, Inc. to operate a Mobile Integrated Health Service which consist
of; non-emergency and emergency ambulance, specialized transport, community health and
mobile phlebotomy service within the USVI. Contracts for fees for service, and subscription
service, shall be sought with the major Hospitals, Skilled Nursing Facilities, Casino’s, Tourist
Bureau and the Community at large. It is our contention to provide excellent customer service.
Considering the numerous complaints of the lack of current service we feel that by instituting a
policy that provides performance parameters that meets the customers’ needs we will be highly
successful in our goal. It is our intention to provide a two-hour window and true scheduled pick
up times. According to customer surveys, they desire performance and reliability. Ambulance rates
are payable by Medicare at $221.00 base rate and $7.31 per mile, the average ambulance call per
day at Twin City is four. We expect to double that within the first month. We will also work with
the local physicians to transport all qualifiable patients by ambulance, such as those who are on
oxygen or those who need non-emergency and urgent transportation to the hospital. We shall also
offer to the people of St. Croix a subscription service for ground ambulance, where if they need an
ambulance they receive no bill.

Expansion Launch Strategies

It is our intent to expand Twin City Mobile Integrated Health with two ambulances operating per
day, Mon-Fri and one on the weekends, by salaried personnel on St. Croix and St. Thomas. Once
these units are at 85% capacitance, a third unit will be added. Along with the third unit, a marketing
strategy should be launched in the St. Johns area. Under this expansion project employees and
starting salary ranges would consist of the following:

4 fulltime Receptionist / Secretary / Dispatcher, $25k/year each

1 Salaried Chief Executive Officer / Paramedic, $100k/year

1 Salaried Medical Director, $125k/year

1 Salaried Human Resource Director, $75k/year

1 Salaried Chief Operations Officer (Paramedic) $85k/year

1 Salaried Supervisor / Customer Care Advocate (Paramedic or Advance EMT) $75k/year
12 Fulltime Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) $45k/year each = $450k/year

9 Part time Advance Emergency Medical Technician $55k/year each = $495k/year
