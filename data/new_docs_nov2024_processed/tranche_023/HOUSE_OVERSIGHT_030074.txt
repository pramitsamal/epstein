The contradictions and anomalies of U.S. foreign policy have also
been on stark display in the Obama administration's differing
responses to Qaddafi's and Assad's repression of their own people.
Beating up Qaddafi proved doable and necessary to prevent what was
viewed as potential atrocities by his forces in Benghazi. Libya had
few significant air defense systems and no friends; it was

relatively easy to construct a coalition of the (semi-)willing in the
United Nations, NATO and the Arab League to oppose the man
President Ronald Reagan once dubbed the mad dog of the Middle
East -- a tin pot and often bizarre dictator who opposed reform and
political change. If you wanted to construct a more vulnerable target
in a laboratory, you couldn't have done much better.

Syria presents a profoundly different situation. U.S. policy has always
been driven by the hope that the Assads would change and the fear of
what might replace them if they fell. Three additional realities
ensured a U.S. response quite different from the one for Libya.

First, Syria was hard. It's a country with a sophisticated air defense
system, chemical and biological weapons, and a great many friends --
including Iran and Hezbollah, which are capable of striking back.
Marshaling support at the United Nations, mobilizing NATO, and
getting buy-in from the Arab League in the way that made the Libya
intervention possible are not in the cards. Some of America's closest
friends, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, are also not at all sure that
Syria without Assad would be better than with him.

Second, for most U.S. presidents -- Ronald Reagan and George W.
Bush being the exceptions -- Syria has served as a kind of unholy
diplomatic grail. Since Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, U.S.
policymakers had viewed the Assads as pragmatists capable of
facilitating or blocking U.S. policy in Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli
peace process.
