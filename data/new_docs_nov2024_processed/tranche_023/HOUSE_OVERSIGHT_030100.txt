sold the bank a “bill of goods,” arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never worked and
InfoSpan wasn’t as big a company as it claimed.

The bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the
bank’s money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan’s employees, Ruemmler told
the jury.

“They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded,” she said.

Lubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that Emirates
Bank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts.

Bajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn’t know his next steps.

“T am just beat up,” he said.
