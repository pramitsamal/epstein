To understand the next 4 years, you have to understand the world according to Chicago ...
While Chicago isacityin [Illinois , it is almost a completely different country when

it comes to politics, with a whole different set of morals and language.

There are only three rules and a Prime Directive which anybody can understand. You don't
even need an attorney to understand them --and if you need an attorney, well, you know too
much...so look out for Rule #3!

RULE #1...No matter what you see, hear, or do --you don't know anybody and you don't
know nothing!

RULE #2...If you capture something on tape or camera -- it doesn't reveal nothing!

RULE #3...1f you know what everybody knows in Chicago --well, you sti//l don't know
nothing.

The PRIME DIRECTIVE in CHICAGO ...No matter what the vote Democrats win
the election. Now pay close attention!

It's very simple....we'll illustrate. Remember, you know nothing.

These two? They don't know each other! They said they didn't.
