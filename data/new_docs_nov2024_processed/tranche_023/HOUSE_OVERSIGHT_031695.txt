This Break Fast is one of a number of social events involving post-prison Jeffrey that attracted celebrated, powerful people.
Of course I have zero idea who said, NO WAY and didn't cross his doorway.

My questions are:

1) I You have known him for decades, were/are friends, etc.

Why was your reaction to his crimes to continue being his friend --- and not in a covert way?
2) What would he have had to do for you to shun him --- to cut him out of your life?

You're the ultimate professional; you may not want to respond.

Especially because I'm NOT reaching out to anyone else who's named in the piece.

I don't care about them.

But it ain't me to blindside you.

As you've seen, I'm doing a piece for the Times.
You're briefly in it.

I'd like 3 minutes of your time, if possible.

Turning it in late Sunday....

We could do this by email.
Or phone.
