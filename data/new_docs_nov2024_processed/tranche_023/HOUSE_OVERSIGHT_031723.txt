America’s nation-building exercise of the past twenty years was
founded on self-contradictions that have tarnished US foreign
credibility. The geopolitical framework for that policy has been
“embrace and abandon,” a formula that has caused frustration,
confusion and concern to America’s allies in the region and displaced
many millions of young refugees.

As America rethinks its interests in the Middle East, its primary
concern is the elimination of domestic terrorism. The path forward
replaces fear with hope and poverty with prosperity. Once security in
the Middle East is attained, including a negotiated peace between the
Israelis and the Palestinians, the USA must respond with an “end-
state” perspective to draw a comprehensive solution similar to the
Marshall Plan. Going from promoting then dumping dictators to
drawing a new manifesto for economic rebirth would mean that
finally, the America is finally doing right in teeming, oil-rich desert
lands where it did wrong for decades.
