tulers, but also puts his eyes on the wealth at their hands. During his election
campaign, he literally said, “Saudi Arabia is just like 'a milk cow' and we
will slaughter it when its milk runs out”. He may announce increase of the
annual attribute provided by every rulers. Also, he may announce administrative
redistribution of the states. Moreover, he may spreads his teeth regarding the new
rules of the rulers. This may be through involving them in land wars against each
other and not against their real enemy, as he is on his way to Israel; and you do

not know what Israel is?!

The new Caliphate does not hide that he want to empower Israel more and
mote, to cover from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, all the Levant, Arabian Island and Persia
lands. Therefore, he 1s going to leave from the lands of Hijaz to the Palestinian
occupied lands before leaving to Vatican. He clearly refers to that it is a political
tour with religious purposes. It will comes to our ears, all the time, expressions like
terrorism, extremism, stiffness, sects, Sunni Islam, Shiite Axis and other
expressions that cause more dilemmas and allies in the region. However, the visit

is covered by the title of “Mutual Interests”.

I wish we would not live this day or witness a status in which the Arab and
Islamic leaders run rapidly to a person who does not hide his aggressive feelings

towards Arabs and Muslims. At least, I would like to see pre-coordination
