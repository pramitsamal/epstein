The Geopolitics of Israel: Biblical and
Modern

The founding principle of geopolitics is that place — geography —
plays a significant role in determining how nations will behave. If
that theory is true, then there ought to be a deep continuity in a
nation's foreign policy. Israel is a laboratory for this theory, since it
has existed in three different manifestations in roughly the same
place, twice in antiquity and once in modernity. If geopolitics is
correct, then Israeli foreign policy, independent of policymakers,
technology or the identity of neighbors, ought to have important
common features. This is, therefore, a discussion of common
principles in Israeli foreign policy over nearly 3,000 years.

For convenience, we will use the term Israel to connote all of the
Hebrew and Jewish entities that have existed in the Levant since the
invasion of the region as chronicled in the Book of Joshua. As
always, geopolitics requires a consideration of three dimensions: the
internal geopolitics of Israel, the interaction of Israel and the
immediate neighbors who share borders with it, and Israel's
interaction with what we will call great powers, beyond Israel's
borderlands.

Israel has manifested itself three times in history. The first
manifestation began with the invasion led by Joshua and lasted
through its division into two kingdoms, the Babylonian conquest of
the Kingdom of Judah and the deportation to Babylon early in the
sixth century B.C. The second manifestation began when Israel was
recreated in 540 B.C. by the Persians, who had defeated the
Babylonians. The nature of this second manifestation changed in the
