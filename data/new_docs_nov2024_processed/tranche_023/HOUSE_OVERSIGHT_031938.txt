This fear that al-Qaeda’s extreme tactics were burning too hot and
alienating Muslims was also the theme of a remarkable message that
Atiyah sent in 2005 to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the murderous chief
of al-Qaeda in Iraq. In this document, made public five years ago by
the United States, Attyah warned that fomenting Sunni-Shiite
violence (which was Zarqawi’s trademark) was potentially ruinous.
The al-Qaeda that emerges from these documents is a badly battered
and disoriented group. The June 3 death of Ilyas Kashmiri in a drone
attack illustrates the organization’s continuing vulnerability.
Kashmiri was a ruthless operator who planned the 2008 Mumbai
attacks that killed 166 people and was plotting deadly attacks on
Europe last winter that were stopped only because of aggressive
counterterrorism work. (Security services from Europe and Turkey
arrested about 20 of Kashmiri’s operatives before they could carry
out the attacks.)

When top U.S. officials summarize their view of al-Qaeda now, in the
run-up to the 9/11 anniversary, they describe an organization that is
down but certainly not out. They don’t know of any specific plots
targeting the United States, 10 years on. But they’re looking, pulsing
every channel they know. They recognize that it’s what we still don’t
know about al-Qaeda that’s most dangerous.
