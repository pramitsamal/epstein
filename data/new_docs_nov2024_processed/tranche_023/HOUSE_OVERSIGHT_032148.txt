Over the last decade, Siem Reap, the gateway to Cambodia's
magnificent temples of Angkor Wat, has morphed from a dusty
backpacker hangout to a picturesque town filled with an array of five-star
hotels, artsy boutiques and restaurants oozing with ambience. Service
here is some of the finest and friendliest in the region, a trait nowhere
more evident than at the all-suite Alila Sothea. The hotel's regal 39
rooms, which surround a glittering slate-and-gold-leaf-tiled pool, offer a
tranquil, resort-like atmosphere that's rich with local culture and just 20
minutes by car from Angkor.
