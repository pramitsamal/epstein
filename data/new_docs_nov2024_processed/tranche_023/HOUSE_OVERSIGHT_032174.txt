educated and potentially high-achieving population that is trapped
with no horizon. Pressure needs to be maintained to end the siege
entirely, they say, and talk of improvement is counterproductive.
The recent changes stem from a combination of Israeli policy shifts
and the chaos in Egypt. The new Egyptian border policy has made
little difference, but Egypt’s revolution and its reduced policing in
the Sinai have had a profound effect.

For the past year, Israel has allowed most everything into Gaza but
cement, steel and other construction material — other than for
internationally supervised projects — because they are worried that
such supplies can be used by Hamas for bunkers and bombs. A
number of international projects are proceeding, but there is an urgent
need for housing, street paving, schools, factories and public works
projects, all under Hamas or the private sector, and Israel’s policy
bans access to the goods to move those forward.

So in recent months, tunnels under the southern border that were
used to bring in consumer goods have become almost fully devoted
to smuggling in building materials.

Sacks of cement and piles of gravel, Turkish in origin and bought
legally in Egypt, are smuggled through the hundreds of tunnels in
double shifts, day and night, totaling some 3,000 tons a day. Since
the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian security
authorities no longer stop the smugglers. Streets are being paved and
buildings constructed.

“Mubarak was crushing us before,” said Mahmoud Mohammad, a
subcontractor whose 10-man crew in Gaza City was unloading steel
bars that were carried through the tunnels and were destined for a
new restaurant. “Last year we were sitting at home. The contractor I
work for has three major projects going.”

Nearby, Amer Selmi was supervising the building of a three-story, $2
million wedding hall. Most of his materials come from the tunnels.
