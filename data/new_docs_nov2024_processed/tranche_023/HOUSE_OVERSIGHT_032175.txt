Karim Gharbawi is an architect and building designer with 10
projects under way, all of them eight- and nine-story residential
properties. He said there were some 130 engineering and design firms
in Gaza. Two years ago, none were working. Today, he said, all of
them are.

Another result of the regional changes is the many new cars here.
Israel allows in 20 a week, but that does not meet the need. Hundreds
of BMWs, pickup trucks and other vehicles have arrived in recent
months from Libya, driven through Egypt and sold via the
unmonitored tunnels. Dozens of white Kia Sportage models,
ubiquitous on the street, are widely thought to have come from the
same dealership in Benghazi, Libya, that was looted after the uprising
there began.

Hamas’s control of Gaza appears firmer than ever, and the looser
tunnel patrols in Egypt mean greater access to weapons as well. But
opinion surveys show that its more secular rival, Fatah, is more
popular. That may explain why an attempt at political unity with
Fatah is moving slowly: the Hamas leaders here are likely to lose
their jobs. The hospital supply crisis is a direct result of tensions with
Fatah in the West Bank, which has kept the supplies from being
shipped here.

Efforts by fringe Islamist groups to challenge Hamas have had little
effect. And it has been a year since the government unsuccessfully
sought to impose tighter religious restrictions by banning women
from smoking water pipes in public. On a recent afternoon in the new
Carino’s restaurant — with billiards, enormous flat-screen
televisions, buttery-soft chairs — women without head coverings
were smoking freely.

But such places and people represent a wafer-thin slice of Gazan
society, and focusing on them distorts the broader and grimmer
picture.
