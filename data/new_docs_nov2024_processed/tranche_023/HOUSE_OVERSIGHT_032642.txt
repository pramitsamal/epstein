RLK: We have to wait and see how that strengthening of
reform and strengthening of rule of law is going to turn out.

HOST: Indeed. I do have one final question because Mr.
Trump is heading that way in a matter of days really. What
does Mr. Xi make of Donald Trump? Donald Trump thinks
they’re best buddies. What do you think Mr. Xi makes of
Donald Trump?

RLK: Before Trump came into office I know very specifically
there were various think tanks that were engaging in
various scenario planning on how to deal with Trump and
his vicissitudes.

RLK: And the conclusion was to let it play out, don’t react
to virtually anything, and treat the U.S. just like it did in
normal times. And so] think that will be the approach. It'll
be very straight forward. China won't react to the highs or
lows. It’ll treat the protocol at a very high level. And I think
based on Trump’s personality that he will react well to that.
The substance that comes out of that, whether it’s North
Korea or trade, will have to wait. We could be quite
skeptical about the substance of the results, but I think the
form will look good.

HOST: It’s going to be fascinating. Robert Lawrence Kuhn,
great to have you on again. Appreciate your insights. Thank
you.
