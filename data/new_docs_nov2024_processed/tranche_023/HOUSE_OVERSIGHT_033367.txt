5/29/2019 Opinion | Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War - The New York Times

If that’s what the Trump administration wants, its strategy has been a great success. If not, and
the president really wants a trade deal, with reasonable decreases in the bilateral trade deficit,
and some substantive changes in Chinese economic behavior, the American negotiating strategy
requires some serious recalibration.

Of course, China’s public position is that negotiations can continue. Even within the framework of
the new “red lines,” there may still be room for a deal. China might agree to purchase more
American goods, with America yielding on the retention of tariffs, and the unilateral right to
impose tariffs later. However, the degree of difficulty in getting to an agreement has now
increased substantially.

The bottom line is that nationalism is not just a factor in Trump’s America. It’s now a big factor in
Xi Jinping’s China as well, reinforced through the prism of Chinese history. In most of its dealings
with America over the last 100 years, China has seen itself as weak. Today, in Beijing’s view,
China is weak no longer.
