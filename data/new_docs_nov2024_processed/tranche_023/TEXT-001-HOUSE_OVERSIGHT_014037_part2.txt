commission of sex offenses. But after the FBI developed substantial
evidence of those sex offenses, identified victims of those offenses, and
presented the case to the appropriate U.S. Attorney’s Office for prosecution,
CVRA rights would have attached. Accordingly, the FBI would have been
required to notify the identified victims of their rights under the CVRA (as
well as under the VRRA). From that point forward in the case, the victims
would have had CVRA rights, such as the right to fair treatment and the
right to confer with prosecutors. In this case, the victims would have had
the right to confer with prosecutors about the nonprosecution agreement
that they ultimately reached with Epstein. 199
C. CURRENT DEPARTMENT POLICY ON PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS
One objection that might be made to the formulation offered above is
that it might unduly burden federal law enforcement officers and
prosecutors, who would need to make judgment calls about when an
investigation has coalesced to the point where “victims” are in existence,
“substantial evidence” has been collected, and notice of rights has to be
provided. Any such objection would be ill-founded, though, as it does not
appear that implementing such an approach would be difficult. 200
Presumably the Justice Department has already been providing such rights
in at least Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to comply with the Fifth
197 See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422(b), 2423(b), (e) (2012).
198 A more substantial summary of the case is available in case filings. See Jane Doe
Motion, supra note 40.
199 See supra Part II.
200 This Article does not discuss mass victim cases in which notice needs to be provided
to hundreds of victims. But in such situations, the CVRA already provides for “reasonable”
alternative procedures. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(2) (2012). The Department of Justice, for
example, has used websites to provide notice in terrorism cases to large numbers of victims.

2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 95
Circuit’s 2008 ruling in In Re Dean, which held that the CVRA extends
rights to victims before defendants are charged. 201 We have not seen any
reports that providing the rights has been difficult.
Perhaps the reason for the lack of any reported difficulty is that the
Department’s current policy on crime victims’ rights already requires
notices to victims during investigations. The Justice Department has
promulgated the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness
Assistance, the latest edition of which is from May 2012. The Guidelines
discuss crime victims’ rights under both the CVRA and the earlier VRRA.
Because of the OLC memorandum discussed above, the Guidelines limit
CVRA rights until after the time “when criminal proceedings are initiated
by complaint, information, or indictment.” 202 The Department, however,
provides hortatory guidance that Justice Department employees shall make
“best efforts” to notify crime victims about their CVRA rights “as early in
the criminal justice process as is feasible and appropriate.” 203
Of greater interest, however, is the Department’s mandatory policy
regarding notification regarding crime victim services under the VRRA.
The Guidelines explain how “Department responsibilities to crime victims
begin as soon as possible after the detection of a crime at which they may
be undertaken without interfering in the investigation.” 204 The Guidelines
then direct the appropriate “responsible official” to provide crime victims
with “information about services available to them.” 205 This information
must be provided at “the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at
which it may be done without interfering with an investigation.” 206
The Department appears to have little difficulty implementing this
requirement. Evidence of this fact comes from the Justice Department
itself, which responded to the letter from Senator Kyl discussed earlier
questioning why the Department was not applying the CVRA before
charges were filed. 207 In its response, the Department noted that OLC had
issued an opinion that the CVRA did not extend rights before the formal
filing of charges. 208 “Even so,” the Department explained, “the new AG
Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make

reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’
views about, prospective plea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a
charging instrument with the court.” 209
The Department also noted that it provided extensive pre-charging
notifications to victims under the VRRA:
Pursuant to the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA), the Department
identifies victims and provides to them service referrals, reasonable protection, notice
concerning the status of the investigation, and information about the criminal justice
process prior to the filing of any charges. The Department’s investigative agencies
provide such services to thousands of victims every year, whether or not the
investigation results in a federal prosecution. 210
Quantifying the scope of this undertaking with regard to one federal
investigative agency, the Department explained:
[T]he [FBI] alone reports that it provided more than 190,000 services to victims
during the past fiscal year [FY 2011], including case status updates, assistance with
compensation applications and referrals, and counseling referrals. From sexual
assaults in Indian Country to child pornography and human trafficking to mass
violence and overseas terrorism, FBI victim specialists provide much-needed
immediate and ongoing support and information to victims. The FBI addresses victim
safety issues when needed, providing on-scene response and crisis intervention
services in thousands of investigations. With regard to sexual assault victims, FBI
personnel arrange for and often accompany victims to forensic sexual assault medical
examinations and provide assistance with HIV/STD testing. 211
In view of the Department’s existing notifications and provision of
services before charges are filed under the VRRA, it is hard to conceive
how any viable claim could be made that it would be difficult to provide
similar rights under the CVRA. The four rights that would be potentially in
play before charging would be the right to reasonable protection, the right
to fair treatment, and the right to confer with prosecutors, along with the
predicate right to notice of these rights. 212 The VRRA already requires the
Department to provide reasonable protection, so this would not be an
expanded obligation. 213 Similarly, the Guidelines already require
prosecutors to confer with victims about plea agreements (the most
common situation where victims want to confer), so it is hard to imagine
how extending this right would create any undue burden. 214 Additionally,
the right to “fair treatment” could only be a problem if the Department

wanted to treat victims unfairly. Given its repeated and professed
commitment to crime victims, here too this obligation should not be
burdensome. And finally, with regard to providing notice of CVRA rights
to victims, the fact that the Department currently provides notice of VRRA
rights indicates that it should not be difficult to provide notice of CVRA
rights as well.
Indeed, it is possible that the Department’s notification letters under
the VRRA already include this information. Interestingly, in the Epstein
case, the FBI notified Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two
that they had rights in the criminal justice process. As early as June 7,
2007—more than three months before it concluded a nonprosecution
agreement with Epstein—the U.S. Attorney’s Office sent a notice to Jane
Doe Number One stating “your case is under investigation.” 215 The notice
also informed Jane Doe Number One that “as a victim and/or witness of a
federal offense, you have a number of rights.” 216 Among the rights that the
U.S. Attorney’s Office told Jane Doe that she possessed was “[t]he
reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the United States in the
case.” 217 Of course, she would not have had those rights if she was not
covered by the CVRA. The FBI therefore apparently assumed that the
CVRA already applied in the Epstein case. It was only later, when the
matter went into litigation, that the Department of Justice reversed course.
This change in course underscores the problems arising out of the OLC
memorandum and the Department’s current interpretation of the CVRA.
D. STATE LAW EXTENSION OF PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS
The focus of this Article so far has been crime victims’ rights in the
federal system. But in concluding, it is instructive to note how a number of
states offer parallel rights for crime victims, including the right to confer
with prosecutors. In fact, several states have extended such rights prior to
formally filing of charges against defendants—without reported difficulty,
so far as we are aware. This confirms our inference that extending CVRA
rights to crime victims before the formal filing of criminal charges is both
feasible and desirable.
A general overview of state laws illustrates the broad protections
afforded to victims in state criminal justice systems. Nearly two-thirds of
states have adopted constitutional provisions to protect victims throughout

the criminal justice process. 218 Moreover, every state has adopted a statute
that either enforces its constitutional amendment or creates independent
statutory rights for crime victims. 219 As a result, state legislatures and state
employees have attempted to give victims a voice in the criminal justice
process across the country.
Notably, while the strength of these rights varies from state to state, 220
nearly forty states require the prosecuting attorney to notify or confer with
the victim regarding plea negotiations. 221 Several jurisdictions involve the
victim in the charging decision. 222 In some states, law enforcement and
prosecutors must involve the victim at any “critical” 223 or “crucial” 224 stage
of the criminal proceeding; and in a minority of jurisdictions, the judge
must ascertain whether the prosecutor has afforded the victim statutory
protections prior to accepting a plea agreement. 225
The general contours of state provisions suggest that several state
governments have recognized the value in informing victims of their rights
and involving them in the criminal process prior to the formal filing of
charges. 226 Indeed, a brief look at the statutory protections illustrates the
extent to which states have attempted to afford protections to victims long
before the formal filing of charges.

Connecticut, Illinois, and Michigan, among others). Unfortunately, as some commentators
have noted, the notice and conferral provisions in some states are ambiguous, and the
absence of case law precludes a definitive understanding of the reach of the right in some
jurisdictions. See LAFAVE ET AL., supra note 168, § 21.3(f), at 1041–42; see also, e.g., KAN.
STAT. ANN. § 74-7333(a)(5) (2002) (“The views and concerns of victims should be
ascertained and the appropriate assistance provided throughout the criminal process.”). In
some jurisdictions, the ambiguous use of an illustrative list could be read as suggesting that a
particular right, such as conferral, hinges on formal charges. See, e.g., KY. REV. STAT. ANN.
§ 421.500(6) (LexisNexis Supp. 2012) (requiring consultation on “disposition of the case
including dismissal, release of defendant pending judicial proceedings, any conditions of
release, a negotiated plea, and entry into a pretrial diversion program,” but failing to define
“disposition” or “case”).

2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 99
For example, Arizona has adopted a constitutional amendment and
statutes that expansively protect victims. Under Arizona law, the definition
of victim hinges on whether a criminal offense has been committed, and the
term “criminal offense” is defined as “conduct that gives a peace officer or
prosecutor probable cause to believe” a crime has occurred. 227 In short, a
victim’s status does not hinge on the formal filing of charges but rather on
the criminal conduct itself. 228 Arizona law enforcement personnel must
give information to victims describing their rights as soon as possible, even
if formal charges have not yet been filed, and a victim may request that the
prosecutor discuss the disposition of the case, including “a decision not to
proceed with a criminal prosecution, dismissal, plea, or sentence
negotiations and pretrial diversion programs.” 229 A victim may even pursue
some rights if counts are dismissed. 230 Arizona courts have also permitted
victims to invoke their rights in the context of civil forfeiture
proceedings. 231
Hawaii’s victims’ rights statute illustrates how a state has defined the
term “case” more expansively than the limited definition advocated by the
Department in order to facilitate victim participation. By statute in Hawaii,
victims must, upon request, be informed of “major developments” in any
felony case. 232 Along a similar vein, the prosecuting attorney must consult
or advise the victim about any plea negotiations. 233 Interestingly, however,
the Hawaii legislature defined “major developments” as “arrest or release of
the suspect by the police, case deferral by the police, referral to the
prosecutor by the police, rejection of the case by the prosecutor, preliminary
hearing date, grand jury date, trial and sentencing dates, and the disposition
of the case.” 234 The usage of the term “case” and the plain language of the
provisions demonstrate that victims in the State of Hawaii are entitled to a
notification right and a possible consultation right long before formal
charges are filed.

Other states also expressly extend rights before the filing of charges.
Colorado guarantees rights at “all critical stages of the criminal justice
process[,]” which includes both the filing of charges and the decision to not
file charges. 235 In Missouri, victims have the right:
on charged cases or submitted cases where no charge decision has yet been made, to
be informed by the prosecuting attorney of the status of the case and of the availability
[of different forms of compensation and assistance] and of any final decision by the
prosecuting attorney not to file charges. 236
In New Jersey, officials typically send a letter informing the victim “that the
case has been referred to the prosecutors’ office and explains and offers the
services available from the country office of victim-witness advocacy.” 237
Subsequent letters to the victim ensure that the victim has notice of a series
of decisions long before indictment, 238 and the office actively solicits
information in order to “help the prosecutor’s office decide whether or not
to prosecute a case.” 239 Along a similar vein, the Massachusetts legislature
included a provision that makes it clear that nothing should prevent a
prosecutor from providing victim services to persons injured by the
commission of a crime, even though a complaint or indictment has not yet
been issued. 240
In addition to extending rights before the filing of charges, several
states require consultation before the prosecutor reaches a plea agreement
with the defendant. For example, Idaho’s statute provides that a victim
must be given an opportunity “to communicate with the prosecution in
criminal or juvenile offenses, and be advised of any proposed plea
agreement by the prosecuting attorney prior to entering into a plea
agreement in criminal or juvenile offenses involving crimes of violence, sex

crimes or crimes against children.” 241 In Indiana, the plain language of its
statute leaves open the possibility of a conferral right before formal charges
to the extent that the statute includes two separate time frames: “after a
crime . . . has been charged” or “before any disposition of a criminal case
involving the victim.” 242
To be sure, not all states have afforded victims a voice throughout the
entirety of the criminal justice process. 243 In some states, the statutes are
ambiguous. 244 In a handful of states, there is clear language limiting rights
until after the filing of charges. For example, Louisiana constrains the
conferral right to criminal matters “in which formal charges have been filed
by the district attorney’s office.” 245 Yet, unlike the federal CVRA, this
statute specifically excludes pre-charging situations. And, in any event,
despite Louisiana’s limitation on a particular right within the statute, the
legislature in this state still often saw fit to provide the victim with
notification rights, even in the absence of the formal filing of charges. 246
Very few state courts have ever considered the precise issue of
whether conferral rights may attach prior to the formal filing of charges.
This is likely caused by the fact that, unlike the federal statute, many state
statutes fail to provide the victim with a procedural mechanism for
challenging the conduct of prosecutors or law enforcement agencies. 247
However, in rare cases, state courts have implicitly recognized that a
meaningful interpretation of victims’ rights should include some rights prior
to filing.
For example, a Connecticut court concluded that a company injured by
the delinquent act of a minor was entitled to information about the case
241 IDAHO CODE ANN. § 19-5306(1)(f) (2004). As in the case of most of the state
statutes, the Idaho statute is not without ambiguity. A different provision within the statute

petition . . . .” Id. § 19-5306(2).

243 See, e.g., MD. CONST. art. 47(b) (“In a case originating by indictment or information

244 In Delaware, for example, the statute contains an additional limitation in the conferral
provision that is noticeably absent from the duty imposed on law enforcement to provide
information about the victim’s rights to that victim. Compare DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 11,
§ 9405 (2007), and DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 11, § 9411 (2007) (imposing additional
requirements after the Attorney General commences the prosecution), with DEL. CODE ANN.

contained in a police file in a civil proceeding, even though it appears that
there was little indication that criminal charges had been filed. 248 Similarly,
the South Carolina Supreme Court, while limiting the ability of the victim
to challenge the conduct of a prosecutor, concluded that the same rights
under the state constitution must attach prior to the formal filing of an
indictment. 249 Other courts have even permitted a victim to recover
compensation or reparations for unindicted or acquitted conduct. 250
In other words, while few state judiciaries have addressed the precise
timing of state crime victims’ rights, those that have addressed the question
have typically found that the rights do extend to pre-charging situations.
Despite the relative dearth of state court cases, it is worth noting that
most state statutes unequivocally provide for notification rights early in the
criminal process. 251 For example, the Illinois statute imposes a limited duty
on law enforcement agencies to keep victims informed of the status of an
investigation until the accused is apprehended or the agency discontinues
the investigation. 252 Similarly, law enforcement agencies in Iowa must
keep the victim apprised of the investigation “until the alleged assailant is
apprehended or the investigation is closed.” 253 Michigan’s statute requires
law enforcement to provide information within a mere twenty-four hours of
contact between the agency and the victim. 254
In sum, while state law on crime victims’ rights before charging is not
fully developed, what law exists tends to support the position that crime
victims deserve rights before the formal filing of charges. This law fits the
long-standing trend in states toward expanding protections for crime

express time limitation on the conferral right. See MICH. COMP. LAWS ANN. § 780.756(3)

victims. 255 The decision by state legislators to extend notification or
conferral rights to crime victims demonstrates an express recognition that
crime victims’ meaningful participation in the criminal justice process may
involve granting those victims rights before indictment.
CONCLUSION
Crime victims have important rights at stake in the criminal justice
process, even before prosecutors formally file criminal charges. It is hardly
surprising, therefore, to find that a federal law that Congress in fact
designed to create “broad and encompassing” rights for victims protects
victims during a criminal investigation. As this Article has explained,
interpreting the CVRA to cover crime victims during the pre-charging
phase of a case is consistent with the statute’s purposes, text, legislative
history, and interpretive case law. And state criminal justice systems also
appear to be moving in that direction.
The Justice Department’s contrary interpretation seems unlikely to
prevail when challenged. The CVRA signals a paradigm shift in the way
that crime victims are to be treated, at least within the federal criminal
justice system. Before enactment of the law, federal investigators and
prosecutors might have been able to keep victims at arm’s length, refusing
to confer with them about the case and otherwise ignoring or even
mistreating them during the process. But those days are over. The CVRA
promises victims that they now have the right to confer with prosecutors
and the right to be treated fairly while their cases are investigated. It is time
for the Department of Justice to recognize and embrace that new reality.
