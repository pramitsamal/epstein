scars. She has struggled and continues to struggle with her ability to maintain healthy
relationships with men and in general. Her career is permanently compromised and the
likelihood of recovering severed professional ties is non-existent.

Please contact us within ten days of this letter to advise whether Mr. Epstein is amenable
to attempting to resolve s civil claims without litigation.

Very truly yours,
