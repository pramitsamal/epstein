Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz

Case No.: CACE 15-000072

Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 17 of 20

Ask them [Edwards and Cassell] if they have any evidence ... . They’re doing it for
money. She’s getting money for having sold her story. She wants to sell the book.
They’re trying to get into this lawsuit. They see a pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow. They’re [Edwards and Cassell] prepared to lie, cheat, and steal. These are
unethical lawyers. This is Professor Cassell who shouldn’t be allowed near a
student. This is Professor Cassell, who is a former federal judge, thank God he no
longer wears a robe. He is essentially a crook. He is essentially somebody who’s
distorted the legal profession. . . . Why would he charge a person with a
sterling reputation for 50 years on the basis of the word alone of a woman who is
serial liar, who has lied about former Prime Ministers, former Presidents, has lied
demonstrably.

CNN Live (with Hala Gorani) (January 5, 2015). Of course, by placing “the evidence” in this
case under seal, Dershowitz will be free to continue to try and insinuate that Edward and Cassell
—and their client, Ms. Giuffre — had no evidence supporting the allegations against him, even
though a mountain evidence strongly support Ms. Giuffre’s allegations. See Deposition of Paul
Cassell (Oct. 16, 2015) at 61-117 (Exhibit 3); see also Depo of Pual Cassell (Oct. 17, 2013)
(Exhibit 4).

CONCLUSION
The Court should deny Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Alan Dershowitz’s motion to
place documents regarding Ms. Giuffre’s allegations against him under seal.

I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was sent via E-Serve
to all Counsel on the attached list, this 23°°° day of November, 2015.
