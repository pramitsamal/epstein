p, from now on, and refer to gross realized output Y, gross alone.

Positive cash flow is that less plowback from revenue. This can be notated

Fo= Y gross— p.,, = Y, + D, — Poy? (A3.3)
where p.,, is plowback. Negative cash flow is transfer in, notated t_. Thus
F =t_ and F=F -F =¥,+D,—p,y,—T_ (A3.4)
Cash flow F is the difference
F=F -F =Y,+D,-p,-T_. (A3.5)

Gross output is gross realized output plus unrealized (or proprietary or self-

invested) output. This can show as

=Y gross+ Y, =Y,+D,+Y, . (A3.6)

gross

Think of the subscript s as meaning saved or self-invested. As all output is either

realized or unrealized, we have
Y=Y+Y..
sp

The terms saved, self-invested, unrealized and proprietary will be taken as

interchangeable.
