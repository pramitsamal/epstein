Conclusion

Jeffrey Epstein, a self-made businessman with no prior criminal history, should not be
prosecuted federally for conduct that amounts to, the solicitation of prostitution. A federal
prosecution based on these facts would be an unprecedented exercise of federal power, a misuse
of federal resources, and a prosecution that would carry with it the appearance, if not the reality,
of unwarranted selectivity given the incongruity between the facts as developed in this matter
and the factual paradigms for all other reported federal prosecutions under each of the three
statutes being considered. It would require the pursuit of a novel legal theory never before
sanctioned by federal law—and that indeed is inconsistent with each of the statutes prosecutors
have identified. Accordingly, we respectfully request that you direct the U.S. Attomey’s Office
for the Southern District of Florida to discontinue its involvement in this matter, and return
responsibility for this case to the State of Florida.
