KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP

Most important, however, is that the extraordinary nature of this misconduct, so unusual
in ordinary federal prosecutions, raises the gravest of concerns about why prosecutors would go
to such lengths in a case already being prosecuted by the State and with so little, if any, federal
concern. Accordingly, we ask you to conduct your own investigation of these matters, because
we believe that what we have provided you may constitute only the tip of a very deep iceberg.
Without the power of subpoena, which we currently lack, we are unable to dig deeper. We
strongly believe that there is far more exculpatory evidence that has not been disclosed, more
leaks that we have not yet uncovered and more questionable behavior. This is a case that cries
out for a deeper investigation than we are capable of conducting, before any decision to
prosecute is permitted.
