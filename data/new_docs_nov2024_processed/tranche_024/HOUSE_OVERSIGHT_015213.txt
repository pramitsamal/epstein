American flag shirt. Nor did she have any way of knowing that when he
wore another American flag shirt on 7he Merv Griffin Show, his half of the
TV screen was blocked out all across America. She was, in short, unaware

It’ s Saturday night, and the Carnival Masquerade Ball is being held
in the huge Convention Center Ballroom. On the wall behind the stage are
gigantic masks. Above the tables are gold and purple balloons, fashioned
after either somebody’ s school colors or a Chinese restaurant’ s little hot
mustard and soy sauce plate. The taped music is loud, and the dancing is
raunchy, enhanced by gaudy yellow, blue and red lights. Pheromones are
flying, and the costumes are kinky.

“Costumes,” the program states, “may be anything of fertile
imagination (genital area musts be covered) for an exotic night of adult
social fun.” Hey, look who’ s here: Superman. The Phantom of the Opera.
The devil. Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse (in a see-through top). An
executioner. An Arabian potentate. A gold-plated pharaoh. A chicken lady
covered with big yellow feathers. A guy in a dog collar being led around
on a leash. And the one-legged man, who is wearing a roller skate as his

costume.
