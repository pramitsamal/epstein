Einstein’s Brain

of the brain. Whether this is related to his highly creative thinking or just
random chance is unknown, but it’s an interesting data point in our quest
to understand creativity and intelligence.

Looking through a microscope, the wrinkly grey matter is composed
of 30 trillion neurons; small whitish cells sprouting filaments that wrap
around each other like the tentacles of an octopus. The tentacles, and
there can be as many as 10,000 per cell, are known as dendrites and spread
out to nearly touch other neurons. At the other end of the neuron is a
single axon. The gaps between the end of an axon and the next neuron’s
dendrites are called synapses, about one-tenth of the width of a human
hair and varied in structure. When a nerve ‘fires, an electrical pulse
spreads out along the axon to the end and crosses the synapses to other
brain cells. This electrical pulse is not like the flow of current in a wire:
neurons don't conduct electricity. It is more akin to dominoes falling in
a line. Ion gates in the walls of the neuron open, letting potassium ions
flow out. As the gates open in one section, the next section is triggered
and so on. Thus, electrical signals ripple out along the axon. As the
electrical signals cross the synapses they either excite or inhibit the firing
of adjacent neurons. There is a lot more structure to a neuron than was
once thought. The textbook model is of a sequence of ion sacks stacked
end to end rather like plant cells, but neurons have a far more complex
structure. Bundles of actin and tubulin form a skeleton in the neuron and
the neuron metabolizes ATP to recharge its firing mechanism. Neurons
behave far more like small animals than inanimate plant cells.
