In 2005, George Dyson, a historian of science and technology, visited Google at the
invitation of some Google engineers. The occasion was the sixtieth anniversary of John
von Neumann's proposal for a digital computer. After the visit, George wrote an essay,
“Turing’s Cathedral,” which, for the first time, alerted the public about what Google 's
founders had in store for the world. “We are not scanning all those books to be read by
people,” explained one of his hosts after his talk. “We are scanning them to be read by
an Al.”

George offers a counternarrative to the digital age. His interests have included
the development of the Aleut kayak, the evolution of digital computing and
telecommunications, the origins of the digital universe, and a path not taken into space.
His career (he never finished high school, yet has been awarded an honorary doctorate
jrom the University of Victoria) has proved as impossible to classify as his books.

He likes to point out that analog computing, once believed to be as extinct as the
differential analyzer, has returned. He argues that while we may use digital components,
at a certain point the analog computing being performed by the system far exceeds the
complexity of the digital code with which it is built. He believes that true artificial
intelligence—with analog control systems emerging from a digital substrate the way
digital computers emerged out of analog components in the aftermath of World War II—
may not be as far off as we think.

In this essay, George contemplates the distinction between analog and digital
computation and finds analog to be alive and well. Nature’s response to an attempt to
program machines to control everything may be machines without programming over
which no one has control.
