103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *862

Under the criminal justice systems of all other major common law countries and nearly all European states, victims’ rights also
include authority to challenge prosecutors’ decisions not to prosecute, either by a limited right to initiate prosecutions as private
parties or by enabling victims to trigger judicial or [*863] administrative review of noncharging decisions. °* By contrast,
nearly every U.S. jurisdiction rejects these mechanisms. State and federal laws consistently avoid permitting victims any power
to challenge or encroach on public prosecutorial authority. Federal law, for example, explicitly dictates that nothing im this
[victims' rights] chapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under
his direction. ©? State statutes manifest the same policy in various ways, such as by prohibiting legal remedies for violations
of participation rights they create. °+ U.S. laws limit victims’ participation to non-dispositive forms, such as providing
information and personal statements to prosecutors, judges, and parole boards, which facilitates victims’ influence on public
officials' decisionmaking. ® But state and federal policy rejects enlisting victims as agents of accountability for public
prosecution. °°

In U.S. jurisdictions and elsewhere, the conceptual innovation of victims' rights laws was to recognize victims’ distinct private
[*864] interests in public criminal litigation. Most rights are specific entitlements to advance victims' broader, dignitary right
to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity. ©” These provisions conceive of victims as agents of
individual rights and independent from systemic interests, and their interests can either conflict or align with those of law
enforcement. ° At the same time, victim participation rights can also be understood to serve a broader public interest in
procedural outcomes, on the premise, for example, that prosecutors’ and judges’ decisions will improve with direct input from
victims. Public decisionmaking risks substantive deficiency, and criminal process would be procedurally deficient, without due
regard for victims’ interests. Jurisdictions that empower victims to challenge non-prosecution decisions enable private parties
themselves to address the problem of criminal law underenforcement. The remainder of this Section provides some detail on
contemporary forms of private prosecution authority, their capacity to advance public as well as private interests, and reasons
for its absence (or demise) in U.S. jurisdictions.
