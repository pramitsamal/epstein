enforcement can learn of misconduct done mostly in secret, political or personal incentives for enforcement officials that
discourage zealous enforcement can exist for enforcement officials in the same jurisdiction - perhaps enmeshed in the same
political networks. In short, underenforcement in this realm follows more from favoritism toward offenders than the biases
against victim groups or types of offenses.

Corruption is a notoriously hard concept to define, '*° but that difficulty is actually somewhat useful for present purposes.
Some of what constitutes public corruption is relatively clearly [*892] defined in positive law. Easy cases involve
straightforward property theft or embezzlement, quid pro quo bribery, and extortion. '*! Statutes also make clear at least some
cases of illegal gratuities and breaches of regulations that govern activities such as campaign finance. '** More ambiguous or
marginal cases of alleged corruption, however, illustrate the federal government's ambitious commitment to enforcing broad
interpretations of federal anti-corruption laws to conduct of state and local officials. That enforcement track record
demonstrates the strong commitment to enforcement redundancy in this area.

States have their own regulatory strategies to address government corruption, although independent assessments do not judge
them to be particularly successful. '°? The federal government seems to share that view. The Justice Department created a

Public Integrity Section within the Criminal Division in 1976, !>4

and in the four decades since, federal prosecutors have
[*893] aggressively prosecuted conduct of state and local officials that it determines breaches federal anti-corruption statutes.
'S> For the past two decades, federal anti-corruption prosecutions of state and local officials typically average 350-400 per year.
156 Combatting public corruption is a top priority for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on par with combating threats of
terrorism, foreign espionage, and cyber-warfare. '*7 And many of these prosecutions targeted wrongdoing far removed from
property theft or quid pro quo bribery. !°8 They extend to conduct involving undue influence, breaches of fiduciary duty, or

failure to provide citizens with honest services 1°?

- wrongdoing for which the public harm is sometimes hard to identify.

[#894] By some accounts, including the U.S. Supreme Court's on occasion, 1°!

this enforcement agenda has been overly
aggressive. '°? But Congress has generally encouraged far-reaching federal enforcement, notably by expanding the scope of

federal anti-corruption law in response to narrow judicial interpretation. !®? And the key point here is that the federal executive

in the integrity of the federal prosecutor, U.S. attorneys need not give reasons for refusing to consent to defendant's waiver of jury trial). For
rare examples of U.S. rules requiring prosecutors to give reasons for not charging, see Colo. Rev. Stat. § 16-5-209 (2014) (requiring
prosecutor's reasons upon private complaint objecting to non-prosecution); Pa. R. Crim. P. 506.

Justice Department decisions from judicial review).

Victims' Rights Act Before Criminal Charges Are Filed, /04 J. Crim. I. & Criminology 59, 61-63 (2014) (arguing for victims’ right to confer

formal charges are filed); Jordan v. Dep't of Justice, 173 F. Supp. 3d 44, 52 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (citing In re Dean, 527 F.3d at 395); United

duty to confer before charges are filed). Another district court refused prosecutors' request to dismiss charges before the prosecutor consulted
the victim. United States v. Heaton 458 F. Supp. 2d 1271, 1272 (D. Utah 2006) (citing victim's right under 78 U.S.C. § 3771](a)(8) to be
