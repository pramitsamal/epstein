better able to articulate and defend nuanced positions. The same is true of liberals and everyone

every opinion.

In doing so, I learn a great deal from my students. My classroom is truly a marketplace of ideas.
This should not be surprising, considering my life-long commitment to freedom of expression and
the widest exchange of views, as I describe in the next chapter.

When I was offered the job at Harvard at age 24, I knew that I was qualified to teach theoretical
subjects, but I worried about my lack of real world legal experience, since I had never practiced
law. (One summer at a law firm between my second and third year at Yale does not a practitioner
make.) Unlike some academics, my Brooklyn upbringing gave me a practical bent of mind—
“street smarts”—but I craved some real world experience. I looked for opportunities to become
involved in cases that would provide a smooth transition from theory to practice. Within a few
years of beginning my teaching career, I found a natural transition in the form of First Amendment
cases challenging governmental censorship.
