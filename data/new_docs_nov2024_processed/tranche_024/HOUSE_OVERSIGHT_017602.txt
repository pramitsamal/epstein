the people who were, you know, doing these interrogations, because the logic, which | think Mark
had mentioned, is, you know, this circular logic. So long as there are trained psychologists from

the SERE program who are on site at these interrogations who are saying that these detainees can
withstand this treatment, are not being harmed psychologically, then it’s not torture. So, you know,
you've got this sort of [inaudible] tortured — tortured logic, which is the phrase that has come up, but
it’s this sort of self-justifying loop in which professionals are loaning their credentials to this kind of
activity. And you see the same thing in the Office of Legal Counsel, where you have, you know,
lawyers loaning their credentials to approving what are clear violations of the Geneva Conventions.
