“Six government employees...” Matt Apuzzo, “C.I.A. Officer Is Found Guilty in
Leak Tied to Times Reporter,” New York Times, January 26, 2015. The notable
exception to policy of seeking imprisonment of intelligence workers found guilty of
passing classified information to journalist is the extraordinary case of ex-CIA director
General David Petraeus. General Petraeus had given classified information from his
personal notebooks to his mistress and biographer, Paula Broadwell. Although none of
this information appeared in her 2012 biography A// In: The Education of Davis
Petraeus, he had violated his oath to protect this information. Yet, in a 2014 deal with
the Justice Department, General Petraeus was allowed to plead guilty to a
misdemeanor charge and sentenced to two years probation and a $100,000 fine. See
