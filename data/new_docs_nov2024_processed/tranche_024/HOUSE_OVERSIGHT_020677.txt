What might look like a fun photo at first glance, showing two brothers, Michael and Sean McQuilken, is actually the last
picture of them before being struck by lightning. The photo was taken at Moro Rock in California’s Sequoia National Park
on August 20, 1975. “At the time, we thought this was humorous. I took a photo of Mary (their sister) and Mary took a
photo of Sean and me. I raised my right hand into the air and the ring I had on began to buzz so loudly that everyone
could hear it. I found myself on the ground with the others. Sean was collapsed and huddled on his knees. Smoke was

pouring from his back,” recalled Michael. All of them survived but, sadly, Sean took his own life in 1989.
