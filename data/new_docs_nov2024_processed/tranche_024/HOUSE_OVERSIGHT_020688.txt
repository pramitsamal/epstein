After giving an amazing performance in Chicago’s Civic Opera House back on November 17, 1955, opera singer Maria
Callas was served a court summons by U.S. Marshal Stanley Pringle and Deputy Sheriff Dan Smith for breach of contract.
Upon being presented with the document, Maria screamed “I will not be sued! I have the voice of an angel! No man can

sue me.” The singer was nicknamed “The Tigress” and vowed never to return to Chicago again.
