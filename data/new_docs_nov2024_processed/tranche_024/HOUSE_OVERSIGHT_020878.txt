Entitlement Spending: Lacks Sufficient Dedicated Funding

Entitlement programs were created with the best of intentions by
the Government. They serve many of the nation’s poorest, whose
struggles have been made worse by the financial crisis.

with a pay-as-you-go funding plan and constructed to be legally flexible if
conditions change) and unemployment insurance (which was designed
to be flexible at State level), other entitlement plans (including Medicaid
and Medicare) were developed without sufficient dedicated funding.
