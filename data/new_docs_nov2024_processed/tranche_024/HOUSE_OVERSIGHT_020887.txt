Entitlement Spending: Observation from Previous Slide

e Clearly, lower interest rates have allowed Americans to
borrow more and save less. But given the high correlation
between rising entitlement income for beneficiaries and
declining savings rates, one might also wonder if Americans
feel less compelled to save money as they feel that they can
depend on the government to give them money.

Note: Savings rate is the amount of money saved divided by income after taxes.
