Medicare: Observations

e 46 million elderly Americans (15% of population) received an average
of $8,325 in tax-payer funded payments for healthcare in 2009 ($5,079
for hospital care; $3,246 for medical insurance & prescription drugs).

e On the surface, $8,325 in free healthcare benefits every year certainly
seems like a high number — 23% of annual per-capita income —
(although working Medicare recipients do pay Medicare taxes).

e As with employer-sponsored health insurance plans, if people, in effect, get
a free benefit (with little personal financial commitment), they may not be
especially diligent and frugal about how they ‘spend’ it. The same concept
extends beyond healthcare recipients to the healthcare providers.*

e When Medicare was created in 1965 to provide health insurance to elderly
Americans, 1 in 10 Americans received Medicare, now 1 in 7 Americans receives
Medicare...above the initial ‘plan.’

Note: *The issue that people overuse services for which they do not have personal financial commitment applies to most
private insurance as well. For a more detailed discussion, see slide 293. Data are inflation adjusted using BEA’s GDP price
