How will levered companies react?

Companies will likely grow comfortable with a smaller amount of debt, retain more
earnings, use less cash for dividends and share buybacks, and potentially draw down
cash if they have it. If a tax holiday is also granted, that might offset the loss of benefit.
Companies that regularly issue long-term debt may choose to reduce that burden to
offset the tax change, and find those funds elsewhere. We find it unlikely that the
change would result in a surge in equity issuance, unless the change applies to existing
debt, which is unlikely in our view. While this change should be taken as a line item ina
wholistic bill, there are victims and beneficiaries here. Corporations that have high
leverage ratios, low retained earnings, high interest expense to earnings ratios, no cash
overseas offset from repatriation, and those that have recurring long-term debt needs
may be most at risk.

Other implications

While some argue that companies will try to raise outsized amounts of investment grade
capital ahead of the deadline to lock in funding with the tax benefit before the loophole
is closed, there is a reasonable chance that a provision is included in the legislation that
would treat such debt as new debt. In our Investment Grade Strategist Hans Mikkelsen’s
view, demand for IG credit could be materially reduced over time. The tax change could
also dampen Leverage Buyout (LBOQ) activity, according to our High Yield strategist
Michael Contopoulos, where these funds are already struggling to generate high returns
—note that LBO funds are currently sitting on close to $1tn in cash looking for a home,
according to Preqin’s third quarter update.

Who could be hurt: See Table 21 for a screen of stocks with high net interest
expense as a percentage of net income which could potentially be hurt most by an
end to the deductibility of interest expense.
