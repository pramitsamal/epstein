Illustrative Schematic: Centralized Network versus Distributed Network

Centralized Network Distributed Network

= Blockchain is the critical and differentiating infrastructure that underlies cryptocurrencies.

= Unlike most networks today, which rely on a centralized hub, a blockchain is a public distributed network whose
complete database can be accessed and maintained by each member of the network.

# The blockchain is a shared and continually reconciled database. As new transactions occur, data is quickly
disseminated to, verified, and incorporated across all nodes on the network.

= Because it has no single maintainer, the blockchain’s history is resistant to editing by a malicious actor.
