= In addition to speculation, which has been the biggest driver of cryptocurrency appreciation, other drivers include:

= Perceived Scarcity: Bitcoin’s 21 million token cap is expected to be reached in 2140 (16.5 million today). Many of the
over 2,000 other cryptocurrencies, however, do not have a capped supply. Further, while unlikely, bitcoin’s token cap
could be raised if a consensus of programmers decided so.

= Desired Safe-haven: Increased global participation reflects desire for an asset independent from governments or central
banks (“digital gold”). Many governments from which investors have sought diversification, however, have recently
banned domestic crypto-exchanges.
