must make difficult choices about how we carry out our mandate as demand
for our services increases.

We look forward to building on our first four years and continuing our
service of helping anyone—requester or agency—with any part of the FOIA
process and improving the administration of FOIA.

You may notice that this report is slimmer than our first three reports. Please

visit our blog, The FOIA Ombudsman: Information and Advice, where you'll

find many of the items we included in past reports.

Sincerely,

Creituiarn Whaal
