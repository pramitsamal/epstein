OGIS RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR IMPROVING FOIA

FOIA also directs OGIS to make recommendations to Congress and the

President to improve FOIA. In April 2012, OGIS released five recommendations

that the Office compiled in its first years. For example, OGIS encouraged agency
participation in FOIAonline, the Federal Government’s first multiagency FOIA

portal. As a founding partner in FOIAonline, OGIS continues to support the
portal’s improvement of services and expansion of partners.

In March 2013, OGIS issued four additional recommendations for

improving FOIA.

1. IMPLEMENTING DISPUTE
RESOLUTION FOR FOIA CONFLICTS

OGIS expanded its dispute resolution program to connect FOIA professionals,
legal counsel, and dispute resolution professionals to embed dispute resolution
firmly into an agency’s FOIA process. The goal is to identify issues that are
ripe for partnership and explore ways to work together to prevent and resolve
disputes as well as avoid litigation.

In 2013, OGIS identified several agencies, including OGIS’s parent agency,
NARA, to help to pilot a project designed to prevent and resolve disputes as
well as avoid litigation. OGIS has begun meeting with each of these agencies
to determine the types of FOIA disputes that result in litigation and to explore
ways to incorporate dispute resolution into their FOIA processes. (OGIS

also has worked with the Administrative Conference of the United States

to promote research into FOIA litigation to inform this process.) OGIS will

continue to pilot this project in FY 2014.
