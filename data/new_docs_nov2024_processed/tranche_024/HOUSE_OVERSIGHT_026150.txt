Due to the large interest margins and the high commissions, the capital to be
created from profits is growing faster than the reduction of the capital
contributed by the subordinated debt.

Although Raiffeisen has already undergone a sales process twice, the last being 3
years ago, without success, I still consider the amount of its equity at EUR 350

million a very large amount to invest for gaining 0.8% more market share than that
of Ukrsib.

This information is as much I could gather but I will meet with EBRD for other
reasons and will try to extract more information mostly on the intentions of BNP in
dealing with their Ukrainian presence. From what I know EBRD’s 40% is
considered exceptionally high as equity participation percentage comparing to their
usual 10-15% and most probably they would be willing to listen to exit scenarios,
possibly remaining as shareholders at a lower percentage.

I think it is too early to discuss potential price but having EBRD inside already I
would assume that 1x less due diligence adjustments should be the maximum,
