Financing Needed

Currently the business receives $8000 as funding by the founder every month. No loans
have been taken. Founders are not taking any salaries and will not do so for another 2
years.

We are looking to raise $2.4 million at a $10 million valuation to scale. We require
$800,000 per year for the next three years. The proceedings will be used to:

- Refine our sentiment analysis system (currently 5% false positives)
- Hire a PR firm

- Hire a Data Scientist

- Marketing and Sales (UK and US Market)

- Office space in London and San Francisco
