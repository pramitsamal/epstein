Christian West that believes in the underpinnings of that and believes in the precepts of
that and want to see that bequeathed to other generations down the road as it was
bequeathed to us, particularly as you're in a city like Rome, and in a place like the Vatican,
see what’s been bequeathed to us — ask yourself, 500 years from today, what are they
going to say about me? What are they going to say about what I did at the beginning
stages of this crisis?

Because it is a crisis, and it’s not going away. You don’t have to take my word for it. All
you have to do is read the news every day, see what’s coming up, see what they’re putting
on Twitter, what they’re putting on Facebook, see what’s on CNN, what’s on BBC. See
what’s happening, and you will see we’re in a war of immense proportions. It’s very easy
to play to our baser instincts, and we can’t do that. But our forefathers didn’t do it either.
And they were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to
bequeath to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind, so I think
it’s incumbent on all of us to do what I call a gut check, to really think about what our role

is in this battle that’s before us.
