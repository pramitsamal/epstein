PS: Ben, any emails I’ve sent to Lord Mandelson always bounced back. Clearly I don’t have the correct email address. Kindly
forward this note to Lord Mandelson and forward his correct email address to me. Thanks.

Michael,
Thanks for your time on Friday, it was great to hear more about FIO, we are keen to hear more.

In terms of follow up

- we look forward to receiving the White Paper that you mentioned.

- we will consider opportunities in Russia, principally via Rusnano, who we are in discussions

with http://www.rusnano.com/Home.aspx?dummy=63423628 1106041875

- you asked about Onexim, this is the principal investment vehicle for Prokhorov (think New Jersey
Nets). He's reckoned to be the wealthiest man in Russia post-crisis. He is investing more in nanotech and
green energy projects.
