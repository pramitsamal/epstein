Topic: The quixotic search for energy solutions

There’s no room to go through the complexities of the storage technologies shown below. Here are a couple of generalizations:

e Less expensive options like pumped hydro and compressed air storage require favorable sites with the right geology, which
are rare in nature and expensive to build from scratch (and often not located near electricity demand centers), and in the case
of compressed air, require co-located gas turbines for compression

e Many battery-based technologies suffer from high upfront capital or operating costs; low energy storage volumes; delayed
response times; safety issues (such as zinc bromine); or short lives (limited number of recharge cycles)

I had a meeting a few weeks ago which was notable for its The cost of electricity storage options
optimism and enthusiasm. I met with the managers of Eos Range of levelized costs, $ perkWh
Energy Storage, which is working on a zinc air battery solution $0.60

which aims to conquer all of the obstacles outlined in the second
bullet point above. If the Eos projections bear out, they will offer
battery storage at a capital cost of ~$160 per kWh, in the form of
a 1 MW battery that is the size of a 40 foot shipping container
(for 6 MWh of storage). As with the table on page 2, the concept —go.40
of “levelized cost” synthesizes upfront costs, financing costs,

useful life, fuel costs and ongoing maintenance expenses. Rather

than looking projections of capital costs per kWh, levelized cost $0.30
comparisons are more useful. As shown, Eos aims to be the
cheapest option that can be scaled, and flexibly and safely located
where needed. Note as well that they expect to be cheaper than
natural gas peaking plants. This is a relevant benchmark, since
most utilities rely on natural gas peaking plants to meet daily $0.10
peak load requirements and to compensate for intermittent

renewable generation of wind and solar. If storage works, the

need for lots of peaking facilities could disappear.

Eos has a prototype of its Zinc-Air technology that has run
around 2,000 cycles so far; we should all pray either for their
success, or for the success of similar efforts undertaken by their
competitors. Based on the outcome of energy dreams shown on
p.1, we should always be skeptical of breakthrough claims, given
the complexity of the challenge. Let’s hope for the best.

Here’s another look at the financial rewards to anyone who can figure this out. Note how demands on the Texas electricity
grid (ERCOT) are almost 100% inversely correlated with when the wind blows. Either ERCOT gets connected to the national
grid, storage solutions are invented, or a lot of wind energy continues to be underutilized. On the right, what happens when
70% of the grid’s transmission lines, transformers and circuit breakers are 25-30 years old: rising congestion problems,
signified by rising loading relief requests. Grid storage has the potential to alleviate some of this congestion.
