Hurriyet

Why Golda Meir was right

Burak Bekdil

August 23, 2011 -- It has been more than two and a half years since
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told to Israeli President
Shimon Peres’s face, “You (Jews) know well how to kill.” Prime
Minister Erdogan has also declared more than a few times that the
main obstacle to peace in this part of the world is Israel, once calling
the Jewish state “a festering boil in the Middle East that spreads hate
and enmity.” In this holy month of Ramadan full of blood on Muslim
territories, let’s try to identify who are the ones who know well how
to kill. As the Syrian death count clicks every day to come close to
2,000, the Turkish-Kurdish death count does not stop, already over
40,000 since 1984, both adding to the big pool of blood called the
Middle East. Only during this Ramadan, the Kurdistan Workers’
Party, or PKK’s, death toll has reached 50 in this Muslim Kurds vs.
Muslim Turks war. This excludes the PKK casualties in Turkey and
in northern Iraq due to Turkish military retaliation since they are
seldom accurately reported.

Let’s speak of facts.

Sudan is not in the conventional Middle East, so let’s ignore the
genocide there. Let’s ignore, also, the West Pakistani massacres in
East Pakistan (Bangladesh) totaling 1.25 million in 1971. Or 200,000
deaths in Algeria in war between Islamists and the government in
1991-2006. But a simple, strictly Middle East research will give you
one million deaths in the all-Muslim Iran-Iraq war; 300,000 Muslim
minorities killed by Saddam Hussein; 80,000 Iranians killed during
the Islamic revolution; 25,000 deaths in 1970-71, the days of Black
September, by the Jordanian government in its fight against the
